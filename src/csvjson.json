Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you\u2019re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near the South Pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister... Explore the Antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions.

Listen what your men have to tell you. Send evac choppers and nape drops. Defeat the invisible enemy. Decide the fate of your soldiers. The choices you face will have a direct impact on the course of the game. They will also define views of your hero. Or maybe those are your views? Playing Radio Commander you must be prepared to answer tough questions about the righteousness of your actions, the price of a human life, and the toxic power of propaganda and stereotypes. Radio Commander includes: - 9 main campaign missions (every mission is possible to complete in several different ways), - 9 animated briefings, - 15 unit types, including: infantry, evac choppers, gunships, field artillery, aerial reconnaissance, M113 armored personnel carriers, and napalm-carrying F4 Phantom jets (every unit is described by a unique set of statistics and communicates with commander using a different voice), - full voice over, - over 200 dialogue\u2026","ESRBRating":"Mature","Publisher":"Console Labs","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-11","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RadioCommander_image500w.jpg&w=240","Slug":"radio-commander-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/radio-commander-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"65%","Price":"14.99","genre":"Simulation,Puzzle,Action,Strategy","SalePrice":"5.24","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RadioCommander.jpg"},{"SCORE":"65","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/1790/skyhill-switch","SaleEnds":"2021-12-01","Title":"SKYHILL","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2021-11-10","description":"World War III was an unexpected and cruel tragedy\u2026 You seemed to have a nice time, hidden in your fancy penthouse in Skyhill Hotel...

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

With the outbreak of the World War Four in 2050 and the loss of control of the [GEAR System] that followed, the world changed completely. The berserk [GEARs] became know as [RAGE], and combat GEARs around the world began a total massacre of humanity. Humanity was pushed to the brink of extinction, but a few survivors escaped underground and began analyzing the GEAR System to prepare for a counterattack. The war between humans and RAGE was exceedingly fierce, but thanks to the counter-RAGE organization [Freyja] and a certain GEAR mercenary, they steadily began recovering key locations on the surface. In 2112, over 50 years after the war began, humanity reclaimed Japan from the RAGE. 30 years later, in the [Cosmopolis] built upon Osaka, a pilot with an inherited [GEAR] and huge [debt] sets out with his Operator to become a Ranker in the Arena.\u2026","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"ARC SYSTEM WORKS","ReleaseDate":"2019-08-29","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DamascusGearOperationOsaka_image500w.jpg&w=240","Slug":"damascus-gear-operation-osaka-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/damascus-gear-operation-osaka-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"88%","Price":"19.99","genre":"Action,Role-Playing","SalePrice":"2.4","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DamascusGearOperationOsaka.jpg"},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2021-12-02","Title":"Dangerous Relationship","LowestPrice":"7.49","SaleStarted":"2021-11-18","description":"Will your passionate romance come to light?! \"My boyfriend's a celebrity!\" In this romance game for women, enjoy dangerous romance with an idol, an actor, and other celebrities.
