Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?<br /><br />If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode!<br /><br />Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play.<br /><br />You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type.<br /><br />The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it.

Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible.

An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers.<br /><br />Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these \"flying soldiers\" can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these \"characters\", they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance.<br /><br />Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.<br /><br />It's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.<br /><br />Offline play enabled","ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone","Publisher":"Wild Sphere S.L.","ReleaseDate":"2020-09-17","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0306/XAwIPNpQTUn2Orp1uzkGd0WY.png?w=200","Slug":"flying-soldiers-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4035-CUSA20600_00-FLYINGBASEGAME00","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDNdEAW9kTU","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"73%","Price":17.99,"genre":"","SalePrice":4.85,"PlusPrice":3.95,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"-1","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/6244/haimrik-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-02-03 07:59:00","Title":"Haimrik","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-01-19 08:11:27","description":"Become Haimrik, a young scribe trying to make a living in a medieval town full of warriors, sorcerers, dragons and dragon-riding sorcerer-warriors.

Walter's team of treasure hunters, who found the sunken ship at the bottom of the sea only to see the Spanish government lawyers take it off them, are not willing to pass up the opportunity.
