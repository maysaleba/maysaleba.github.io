Music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to the Tetriminos themselves—pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you're playing, making any of the game's 30+ stages and 10+ modes something you'll want to experience over and over again. Plus cross-platform multiplayer modes for competitive and cooperative play! • Close your eyes to enter the ZONE With PS VR2 eye tracking enabled in the game options, you can enter the ZONE by closing and then opening your eyes. • PS VR2 headset feedback Transport yourself into the world of Tetris Effect: Connected where you can feel key moments in gameplay.

Players on different platforms can easily join Friend Match rooms with the new Room ID feature. • A wide variety of competitive and co-op modes! Among the new modes is ""CONNECTED,"" where three players can team up and literally connect their Tetris Matrices to fight against A.I.-controlled Bosses; ""Zone Battle,"" a one-on-one match of standard competitive Tetris, but with a twist: the time-stopping Zone mechanic; and ""Score Attack"" and ""Classic Score Attack,” two single-player versus modes where two players compete separately to see who can get the best score. • Join in on the fun in Spectator mode! Spectator mode is available in Friend Matches. A room can contain up to 8 total people. Spectators can use emotes during the match to liven up the competition. • Transfer save data from the PS4 version to PS5 Download and transfer your PS4 save data to the PS5 using cloud or extended storage or connect to the same network and transfer data directly from PS4 to PS5.

"88","2024-06-12","DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane’s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","2024-05-28","/game/68258","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","16","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","80%","35","Action","349.8","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/deathloop/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","DEATHLOOP","TRD","Bethesda","2021-09-13","deathloop-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","24","349.80","0","",

THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.","2024-05-21","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000","85%","0","Strategy, Simulation, Strategy","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/frostpunk-console-edition/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Frostpunk: Console Edition","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2019-10-10","frostpunk-console-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","749.00","0","112.35","1","",

Take control of a team of deadly specialists and sneak in the shadows between dozens of enemies. Choose your approach when infiltrating mighty castles, snowy mountain monasteries or hidden forest camps. Set traps, poison your opponents or completely avoid enemy contact.

The series that defined narrative-focused first-person psychological horror is back to tell its last spine-chilling story with Layers of Fear. The series’ crowning work is the definitive way to experience the critically acclaimed franchise as it features Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2, as well as all DLCs (including the new ‘The Final Note’ DLC that will give you a new perspective on the Layers of Fear storyline) and the never-before-told story of The Writer, which will tie everything together.

The house may hold everything you need to know... if you can face reliving your past. The Final Note DLC: Delve Even Deeper A brand new DLC which aims to shed more light on The Painter, his muse and the family’s backstory, The Final Note is told from the perspective of The Painter’s Wife. This additional narrative may change how you see the characters of the first game, as well as their actions. Layers of Fear 2: Hit Your Marks “Time waits for no one, actor. Do not waste ours.” You are the lead actor in a production being filmed aboard an ocean liner, but all is not what it seems. Explore the ship and discover why you were perfect for The Director’s (voiced by Tony Todd) latest film. You awake and are told one simple command “Act.” But will you?

"75","2024-06-05","Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison takes on a quest to slay evil transhumanist mastermind Dr. Jadus Heskel in the streets of Neo DC. She leaves a trail of carnage throughout huge, multi-path levels filled with gigantic explosions, more secret areas than we can count, and inhuman foes behind every corner. There’s no regenerating health here; stop taking cover and start running and gunning. Shelly’s crusade to take down Heskel’s army will see her leave destruction in her wake with a wide arsenal of weapons, complete with alternate fire modes and different ammo types. Ion Fury laughs at the idea of mandatory checkpoints and straight paths through shooting galleries.

More physics and interactivity? You betcha. 3DRealms, Voidpoint and Fulqrum Publishing have taken the best of both worlds and cooked it all into a bloody stew.

"68","2024-06-05","The once thriving Kingdom of Hermes has fallen to an age of calamity. Seen as the answer to all the kingdom’s ailments, alchemy became a widely used practice across the land, with denizens welcoming it into their homes, using it to enhance and heal as they saw fit. When the price of alchemy became too steep, attempts to halt its use were made, each as woefully unsuccessful as the last, with the catastrophic consequences felt across the realm. Within days, the kingdom fell to chaos, infected monsters prowling the blood-soaked streets, all hope of a cure lost. Corvus is the kingdom’s final hope, the fate of Hermes resting in his feathered hands. The truth is buried deep in the memories Corvus left scattered throughout the punishing world, and only by collecting these lost memories can the kingdom be saved, but each time he dives back in, trying to piece together the truth, all he finds is more secrets. Key Features Harness the plague: Seize plague weapons from gruesome bosses and formidable enemies, wielding them as deadly weapons. Giving enemies a taste of their own medicine will be the only way to survive the horrors that lurk in the shadows of the once thriving kingdom Embrace the Raven: Shift into your raven form during battle, throw feathers like daggers to interrupt your enemies’ attacks, and perform executions with the swiftness of a raptor.

Play as Gaia, the Spirit of Life, and navigate stunning platforming environments in an abstract world to salvage the souls of extinct animals. Revive these creatures after learning their final fate: the last whale harpooned, the final eagle caged, the last deer hunted down, and more, while you survive encounters with dangerous, oil-covered Devourers that roam the wasteland in search of remaining life. In this emotional journey from the creators of the critically acclaimed Arise: A Simple Story, you alone can restore life to the planet. Key Features: • Gaia’s journey: the last animals have died, and Mother has used all of her Life Force to save their souls, now trapped in their vessels. Gaia’s quest is to rescue each of their souls and bring them back to Mother’s Ark. Gaia’s traversal abilities will allow you to glide, jump, and dash to explore new areas and evade deadly traps, while her special gifts will grant you the power to clear the oil that consumes the world, face hungry Devourers, and break souls free. • A vast, surrealistic world: see through Gaia’s eyes the desolated landscapes that depict the destructive relationships between humans and nature in a beautiful demonstration of abstract artistry. From dying forests to the heart of crumbling cities, through the dry seabed and polluted skies, each environment will offer new challenges for Gaia to face and will present her different versions of the Devourers’ wake of destruction as she spreads life and beauty on her path. • A story of contrasts: After Us offers a somber look at a world decimated by human impact. As you guide Gaia’s light through it and discover the causes behind the destruction, you will learn the fate of the Devourers as agents of extinction, but also agents of progress, love, and hope.","2024-05-28","/game/118233","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202304/0312/293739904a7a7ce07856d5e3324f6e3dcd1e3602fb442425.png?w=200","6","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4829-PPSA07949_00-AFUS00000000SIEE","50%","17","Adventure","689.5","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/after-us/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","After Us","TRD","TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE UK","2023-05-23","after-us-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1379.00","11","689.50","0","",

She will have to find ways to avoid the teeth of machinery primed to grind her into dust, leap across rickety infrastructure that bridges the cavernous darkness all around and avoid the watchful eyes of guards ready to gun her down. She will travel to the city’s brightest highs and delve to its darkest depths on her journey, discovering her destiny among the last free people alive. White Shadows’ striking architectural forms and stunning monochrome art style combine to create a place steeped in atmosphere. It’s a world where the lies of the elite are plastered across its walls, where twisted forms of entertainment are used to keep everyone in their place, and where hope seems in short supply.

"63","2024-06-12","Alone in the Dark weaves a chilling tapestry of psychological horror and Southern Gothic charm, reimagining the iconic game that set the benchmark for the genre. We invite you to join us on a journey into madness, where each encounter could be your last. With each step you take closer to unravelling Derceto's mystery, the eyes that watch from the darkness grow hungrier. Every bullet means the difference between survival and an unthinkable end. The next door you unlock could lead to a nightmarish realm offering nothing but slashing claws, grasping tentacles, and frayed sanity. Journey to interbellum Louisiana, where an era of decadence hides a darker tale - of escape from past traumas and an intolerant society, into the waiting grasp of something darker, something that has patiently lurked for impossible eons. This is Alone in the Dark as you've never seen it - a skillfully-woven narrative of Southern Gothic elegance and eldritch madness that pays homage to its legendary origins while taking the next step forward in survival horror storytelling. A Haunting Tale of Mystery and Madness Step inside Derceto Manor, an asylum shrouded in intrigue, guarding a terrible secret. Client Emily Hartwood and private investigator Edward Carnby embark on a harrowing quest for answers; Emily to the mystery of her missing uncle, Edward to the toughest case he will ever face, and both to questions they dare not ask themselves. This re-envisioned classic invites you to explore an unforgettable single player adventure rich with suspense, frights, and revelations that will test the limits of your imagination. Featuring Hollywood Talent Experience some of the greatest acting survival horror has ever seen through the performances of award-winning actors Jodie Comer (Killing Eve, Free Guy) and David Harbour (Stranger Things, Black Widow) in their first videogame roles. Jodie and David’s immaculately captured likenesses breathe life into Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby, lending a deeply personal aspect to Alone in the Dark’s story that demands it be played twice to get the full experience. A Tribute to Horror Pioneers Rediscover the essence of psychological horror in a game that respectfully nods to its 1992 origin, the game that established the survival horror genre. Alone in the Dark is your gateway to an experience steeped in the atmospheric dread of classic horror, with next-generation storytelling and gameplay. A must-play for fans of twisted tales, nerve-wracking exploration, and desperate combat. A Story That Challenges Reality Envisioned by Mikael Hedberg, acclaimed writer behind modern horror classics “SOMA” and “Amnesia”, Alone in the Dark’s intricate web of mystery delves into themes of trauma, faith, evil, and abandonment. Whether you choose to brave the nightmare as Emily or Edward, you will uncover secrets that defy everything you thought about videogame storytelling.","2024-05-28","/game/112498","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/1015/b3a91fa43661ced3d57a908c26f5bfab057584343be6f618.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4389-PPSA08135_00-ALONEINTHEDARKEU","25%","19","Adventure, Horror, Puzzle","1124.25","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/alone-in-the-dark/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","Alone in the Dark","TRD","THQ NORDIC GMBH","2024-03-20","alone-in-the-dark-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1499.00","10","1124.25","0","",
"63","2024-06-12","A mysterious signal has been recorded coming from the red planet. The message confounded Orochi scientists. Their analysts broke it down and determined it was of intelligent origin. Orochi management immediately concluded that the discovery was too sensitive for public knowledge and moved to keep it hidden. In secret, the corporation began construction of Trailblazer Alpha, a state-of-the-art Mars research outpost designed to identify the true nature of the message. You are Shane Newehart, an engineer stationed at Trailblazer Alpha and your security clearance means you are completely unaware of the existence of the mysterious signal. Your job is simply to keep the lights on until the transport ship Cyrano arrives bringing with it a new team to take over your duties. Soon you discover strange and unusual setbacks. Crucial systems are malfunctioning, the greenhouse is filled with a strange mist and the rest of your team has yet to return from their EVA mission. Things are starting to fall apart. You begin seeing and hearing things that aren’t there. Visions, hallucinations – or is that even what it is? Is this real… or are you slowly descending into madness? Experience true cosmic horror With your only hope of rescue hundreds of thousands of miles away, you will be forced to explore the real-world fears of isolation and paranoia, enhanced with supernatural elements and cosmic horror. Terrifying visions and monstrous apparitions will make you question what is real and what is not as the very fabric of reality threatens to tear at the seams. Explore the darker side of Mars Navigate a functioning Mars base in a game that uses non-fiction elements to immerse players in a believable setting. Overcome obstacles using computers, electrical systems, rovers, solar panels and more, then go beyond the outpost and explore the darker side of Mars.

"51","2024-06-12","The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™ follows the Dwarves as they embark on a new adventure to reclaim their legendary home of Moria beneath the Misty Mountains. Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as mysterious dangers await. Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria—known as Khazad-dûm or Dwarrowdelf—in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there’s clatter, there’s combat. Excavate the mysteries of three legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within. Key Game Features: ● Feel the Fellowship: Experience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. ● Survive the Dark: To survive the treacherous Mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain. ● Base Building: Find solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to destroy Dwarven progress. ● Rebuild and Reshape Moria: Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dûm to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses. Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources. ● Explore: Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger, providing a unique experience each and every time. ● Co-op Multiplayer: Adventure alone or band together with friends in online cooperative multiplayer. ● Craft Dwarven Tools, Weapons and More: Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor, tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines. ● Uncover Magic Artifacts: Discover ancient magic items including swords that glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom. ● Mine Ore and Jewels: Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril. Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear. But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness. ● Comprehensive Dwarf Builder: Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator. Dwarves can be customized in a variety of ways to create a unique Dwarven identity. Then, during gameplay, players can find and craft armor and weapons to further enhance their unique style.","2024-05-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0520/d7bb0cab42052c1946d6fdcf236f059ee850819f9008843c.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7581-PPSA16618_00-0277621140622233","20%","0","Adventure","503.2","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™","TRD","North Beach Games","2023-12-04","the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","629.00","0","503.20","0","",

"","2024-06-05","The story of Raji: An Ancient Epic begins with the start of a new war between the demons and the gods. Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction. Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons. Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race. Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war. Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura. Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene! Every corner of the game’s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games. Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next. For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored. From enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.","2024-05-21","/game/69306","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202404/0813/3e8fb0793c66003c8cec1a334d627ac8ae96397898ade99c.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5176-PPSA21947_00-0115935370185432","75%","6","Action","0","null","null","Raji: An Ancient Epic","TRD","NODDING HEADS GAMES","2024-04-16","raji-an-ancient-epic-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","629.00","5","157.25","1","",

Do you want your very own zombie companion? A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen! Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable. It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive… A destination with plenty of surprises Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive. Home sweet home Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. The more the merrier… You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable. Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.

Do you want to focus on sheer destruction or are you into a more subtle puppetmaster approach? Slowly gain new powers by upgrading the Portal. Continue to sinisterly interact with the world to produce Chaotic Energy. You gain permanent access to more heinous Powers by upgrading the Portal. Depending on map size - from small to extra large - one playthrough may be longer or shorter. But more villagers means more ways to combine your demonic skills! You can experiment by combining destructive spells. The easiest way to wipe out villagers is to simply cast powerful spells like Earthquakes, Lightning and more. But what happens when you hurl a meteor at a poisonous puddle? Poisonous meteor explosions, that's what! And that's just one of the many nefarious ways that you can combine elemental interactions. You can afflict villagers with flaws. Sure, you could just destroy the world with ice and fire, but the real fun begins when you meddle with villager lives to put them into compelling and tragic situations! Afflict an annoying husband with Unfaithfulness and then watch the fireworks once you tell his wife of his misdeeds. You can spawn monsters to kidnap and harass villagers. You can snatch or seize a roaming monster and then breed it in your Kennel. This will allow you to summon them as part of your monster parties. Create monster parties to snatch Villagers or raid Villages. You can spread malicious info. Your Beholder Structure allows you to spawn Eyes all over the world to gather information. You've seen a Knight steal a Shaman's Potion? Store it as an Intel and then tell the Shaman about it! You can spread Plague. Build the Biolab to afflict Villagers with Plague and summon Plagued Rats. Upgrade your plague with various nasty symptoms and improve its virulence. You can even make Plagued victims explode when they die! You can torture people. You can build a Prison and incarcerate villagers. If necessary, you can torture them in ridiculous ways to afflict them with random flaws. Perhaps someone will have mental anguish and become a Serial Killer when it gets back to its village? You can brainwash folks into becoming cultists. You can also try to brainwash your prisoners. If successful, it will return to its village as a secret cultist who will quietly worship and aid you. You can start a zombie apocalypse. You can also make the Plagued dead rise as zombies. Other villagers that they attack may also contract the virus. Soon, the entire village will be filled with nothing but shambling zombies. You can make Vampires and Werewolves. Afflict a Villager with Vampirism or Lycanthropy to turn them into denizens of the night. Watch as they terrorize their neighbors and spread the curse!

"","2024-06-05","A story from the legends, but in real history Winter War: over 500,000 Soviet soldiers attack Finland, a country with a population of 3,700,000, and the Finns drive them back, inflicting 5 times their own casualties. Continuation War: the Reds return with a total strength of 1,500,000 - almost half of the entire Finnish population - and the Finns stop them again. Finland’s survival in these two brutal wars against an enemy so vast was a true historical miracle. A miracle of heroism and valor. A miracle of the Finnish spirit of liberty. Experience heroic struggle and make tough choices You are the commander of the scarce Finnish troops. Your only goal - to save your homeland and your people from total annihilation. Would you risk losing your experienced troops to try and capture the enemy tanks? Would you try to save the stragglers during the retreat and risk losing everyone, or cut your losses and establish a new line of defense? Would you agree to negotiate with the Soviets that had treacherously attacked you twice before? Play two campaigns: historical and “what if” Historical campaign: Play through a number of missions throughout the 1939-1945 timeline, spanning three wars: Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War. The historical campaign will have smaller-scale but action-packed operations, covering all of the iconic historical battles. Complete numerous objectives grounded in history and narrated by a number of historical characters. Alternate history campaign: Play a shorter campaign with larger operations, centered around the “what if” events. Help the Germans take Leningrad, cut off the allied aid shipments to USSR by taking the port of Murmansk - that is only the beginning. Features: Immerse yourself into the history-driven gameplay: Thanks to cinematics before and after each operation you’ll watch history unfold through the eyes of the key historical figures of the time. Create and grow the army of your own design: Use a number of historical vehicles - all of which are available at historically accurate points in time. Train your troops and choose equipment: Choose various skills for your men as they gain combat experience. Combine units from different classes and acquire diverse equipment for them! Use historical heroes: Every unit could meet certain high requirements to generate a hero with a unique set of powerful skills. For Example the deadliest sniper in WW2 history - Simo HÃ¤yhÃ¤ Manage your Headquarters between the operations: More firepower or better intel - choose in which direction your HQ staff will improve. Use elaborate combat mechanics to overcome any foe: Lethal vs Nonlethal damage or using terrain differences to your advantage - those are just a few of the combat mechanics in-game. Utilize advanced supply and infrastructure systems: All units have limited ammo and fuel that are necessary to operate. You can use this and cut enemy supplies!","2024-05-21","/game/105469","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/0412/7be3130e648346b605f98c4c8947b69725d22aa371a8500d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA16443_00-0902122838417649","35%","0","Strategy, Strategy","999999","null","null","Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty","TRD","Klabater","2023-10-26","strategic-mind-spirit-of-liberty-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","749.00","0","486.85","1","",

"","2024-06-05","Purchase ENDLESSâ„¢ Dungeon 'Last Wish Edition' now and enjoy exclusive content straight out of the Station! ENDLESSâ„¢ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESSâ„¢ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her ""unusual"" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESSâ„¢ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again.","2024-05-21","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0605/NqS2wkRWsphmkL2kpu5seE0W.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0177-PPSA02665_00-ENDLESSDELUXEEU0","40%","0","Strategy, Action","624.5","null","null","ENDLESSâ„¢ Dungeon Last Wish Edition","TRD","SEGA EUROPE LTD","2023-10-17","endless-dungeon-last-wish-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1249.00","0","749.40","1","",

"","2024-06-05","Scorn is an award nominated atmospheric horror adventure set in a nightmarish universe. It is designed around the idea of ""being thrown into the world"". Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself. Every location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world. Throughout the game you will open up new areas, acquire different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to comprehend the sights presented to you. GAMEPLAY FEATURES COHESIVE “LIVED-IN” WORLD Scorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open - the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels. Everything has a reason and purpose - you just need to work out what it is. FULL BODY AWARENESS Players will experience better immersion being aware of the character’s body and movement. Interaction with the world is realistic - objects are picked up with your hands (instead of just floating in midair), machines and instruments are operated by grabbing the controls, etc. Scorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open - the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels. Everything has a reason and purpose - you just need to work out what it is. INVENTORY AND AMMO MANAGEMENT Your loadout is defined and limited. This plays a big role in keeping the player in an even greater state of awareness throughout the whole game. Players will have to think about when to fight and when to take cover and how their actions affect the world around them. Different play styles will be needed to advance.","2024-05-21","/game/77760","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2612/c0678b7593a66fda882dddfe590e609c96072dc1887082e3.png?w=200","5","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7579-PPSA07850_00-SCORN000000PS5EU","50%","6","Horror, Puzzle","499.5","null","null","Scorn","TRD","Kepler Interactive Limited","2023-10-02","scorn-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","999.00","5","499.50","0","",

Would-be marijuana moguls will need to prioritize resources carefully as they manage the production and distribution of their weed. Cultivate killer plants, cross-breed them to create unique strains of the devil’s lettuce, hire and manage a growing staff, and be prepared to take on the competition. As in real life, the business of bud presents plenty of opportunity along with a plethora of problems.

"","2024-06-05","Story: Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine takes place right after the events of Super Meat Boy Forever. After meticulously analyzing Meat Boy all throughout Super Meat Boy Forever (did you notice the cameras in the levels???), the nefarious Dr. Fetus now has all the data he needs to create the perfect Meat Boy clone! There’s just one problem: The DNA sample he’s collected isn’t a perfect specimen, which in turn yields some…less than perfect clones… But fear not, Dr. Fetus knows how to solve this problem. He creates a bunch of ruthless test chambers and starts sending all of the clones he’s created through them, in order to weed out the crap clones from the good ones. The specimens start out looking nothing like Meat Boy, but over time that grotesquely lovable face that Dr. Fetus hates so much, starts to emerge. Perfect clones are just on the horizon and after they’re done…who knows what happens next? Probably something to do joyously with torturing and killing lots of Meat Boys for the hell of it! About The Game: Dr. Fetus` Mean Meat Machine provides the perfect combination of classic puzzle-gameplay and hardcore platforming elements that Super Meat Boy is known for. Puzzle your way through beautiful hand-crafted worlds and more than 100 puzzle-levels, filled with creative traps and hazards. At the end of each world, prepare for a gruesome boss fight that will provide the ultimate challenge. Puzzle your way through familiar Super Meat Boy and Super Meat Boy Forever locations like the picturesque forest, the hospital, and salt factory in a fresh classic puzzle game-inspired format. However, in Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine, matching at least 4 clones of the same kind and creating awesome combos isn't enough – you'll also have to avoid lethal hazards and traps, such as sawblades, rockets and pendulums. It’s a demented and hardcore spin on the classic puzzle formula you know and love! Enjoy dazzling backgrounds and animations from the original Super Meat Boy & Super Meat Boy Forever artists and listen to the wonderful soundtrack by RIDICULON, with unique remixed Super Meat Boy Forever tracks and new tunes. Features: â—� Over 100 hand-crafted levels filled with unique and deadly traps â—� Outrageous boss fights that up the ante with additional mechanics â—� One-of-a-kind combination of puzzle and action gameplay â—� Help Dr. Fetus create the perfect Super Meat Boy clone â—� Revisit worlds from Super Meat Boy and Super Meat Boy Forever â—� Original Soundtrack created by RIDICULON, with unique Remixes from Super Meat Boy Forever tracks and new scores â—� Developed in cooperation with Team Meat and the original Super Meat Boy artists","2024-05-21","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0313/e5d1d67367f770af7e16d8db5b2f4652f85f2ba4a63d0473.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5360-PPSA14003_00-FETUSMEATPS5SIEE","70%","0","Puzzle","62.25","null","null","Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine","TRD","HEADUP GAMES GMBH CO.

The Prince rolled the katamari and made the katamari bigger and bigger, rolling up all the things on the earth. The katamari that he created floated in space, sparkling, and brought back the lost starry sky. As the starry sky was restored, the King's fans gradually grew in number all over the world. The King wanted to respond to the wishes of his fans for his success, and the Prince kept rolling the katamari to make everyone's dreams come true. • We Love Katamari Damacy has been powered up! We Love Katamari Damacy, the second title in the Katamari series released in 2005, has been remastered. The graphics have been completely redesigned, and the in-game UI has been revamped to make it even easier to play. • New additional features such as Royal Reverie are also available! In his youth, the King received a strict education from his father, the Great King. New challenges have been added where you can roll around as the King in his boyhood! The days of hard study and intense training can all be rolled through in 5 all-new challenges. Will the young King be able to clear the tough challenges? In addition, a selfie mode has been added, allowing the Prince and his cousins to take quick photos while rolling through the stages! • A simple but very deep game! Roll the katamari, roll up objects, and make the katamari bigger. You can roll up anything from paper clips and snacks in the house, to telephone poles and buildings in the town, to even living creatures such as people and animals. Once the katamari is complete, it will turn into a star that colors the night sky. You cannot roll up anything larger than the current size of your katamari, so the key is to think in advance about the order in which you roll things up around the stage! * This product is based on the We Love Katamari Damacy software that was released in 2005 on another platform.

Lovingly Lamb-made animation Brought to you by award-winning animation studio Aardman the game features a beautiful hand-painted and traditionally animated art style, spectacular environments and endearing character animation. Reviews for Home Sheep Home 2 “It's like some sort of adorable vortex you never want to leave...there's something to be said for a game that goes out of its way to excel at style and quality, and Home Sheep Home 2 definitely has both by the bushel.” 4.7/5 – Jay Is Games “What’s more impressive about this game is how little is reused. Basic puzzle mechanics stay throughout (only by stepping on the button can you open the door) but the flow of the puzzles doesn’t repeat. Like Braid and Portal before it, there’s a desire to always present the player with new challenges, and it works. One moment you might be evading a giant boulder, only to be grabbing parachutes mid-air the next.” 9/10 – Thunderbolt Games “It looks like many of you really looked forward to this title on the forums, and I can say that it's taken all the concepts from the first game and made them bigger and better, and it doesn't disappoint in its execution.” 4/5 – Touch Arcade","2024-05-21","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/1112/YviLrByQpDGOYCa2PFAujUYh.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2605-CUSA35725_00-3691250995454778","20%","0","Puzzle","146.25","null","null","Home Sheep Home: Farmageddon Party Edition","TRD","GREENLIGHT GAMES","2023-05-25","home-sheep-home-farmageddon-party-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","225.00","0","180.00","1","",
"0","2024-06-05","Whether you are a long-time fan of the world created by J. R. R. Tolkien or whether you are exploring The Lord of the Rings for the first time, the Precious Edition offers an even more immersive game experience. This edition includes: - The Lord of the Rings: Gollumâ„¢ base game. - The Sindarin VO DLC, which adds a touch of authenticity to dialogue with the Elves. - The Lore Compendium DLC, a treasure trove of information about the game's key characters, locations and events, taking you deep into the history of Middle-earth. - The Original Soundtrack application so you can listen to the game soundtrack whenever you want. - The Art Exhibition application that takes you behind the scenes of the game creation process with lots of sketches and development secrets. The Lord of the Rings: Gollumâ„¢ is an official adaptation based on the literary works of J.R.R Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose… How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring â„¢, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dÃ»r and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself… or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn't break; he bends, he adapts… Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It's up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","2024-05-21","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1516/cec5fbb61cd4453f65ef3a79fd63af8b8b7548cb22c91c4f.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG00DELUXE00001","75%","0","Adventure","437.25","null","null","The Lord of the Rings: Gollumâ„¢ - Precious Edition","TRD","NACON SA","2023-05-25","the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-precious-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","0","437.25","1","",

"","2024-06-05","Wobbledogs is a 3D pet simulation where you raise your own personal hive of rapidly mutating dogs, physically simulated all the way down to their guts! It’s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance. Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection! Dogs need a place to call home, and it’s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you’d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most! The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects. Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it’s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that’s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space. These dogs try their best, but sometimes they need a bit of extra help!","2024-05-21","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/0814/u8g6usyPNiBjzh3KNk6Y5KWv.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7072-CUSA35705_00-WOBBLEDOGSWOBBLE","60%","0","Simulation, Casual, Unique","199.6","null","null","Wobbledogs Console Edition","TRD","Secret Mode Limited","2023-05-23","wobbledogs-console-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","0","199.60","1","",

Boredom at home is a thing of the past - today you’ll enjoy nature. Cultivate your own virtual garden, take care of the plants, then harvest and sell them. With Garden Simulator you’ll get your own patch of land, place decorational elements, and nurture the plants, before you harvest them. The richer your yield, the more you can sell and the more money you can spend to enhance your piece of paradise. With countless unlockable features and additional content, your green thumb will be challenged to the max! Lawnmower, watering can and seedlings are waiting for you - get ready for a beautiful and relaxing time in nature. And don’t forget: Gardens are not made by singing ‘Oh, how beautiful,’ and sitting in the shade. • PLANT a wide variety of fruits and vegetables and decorate your garden with a colorful array of flowers. • CARE for your plants, OBSERVE the growth stages and HARVEST the fruits. Whether it's strawberries, lettuce or different types of flowers - the variety of plants makes your garden unique. • DESIGN your garden as you please! Place your flowers and vegetable beds and frame them with different fence elements. Hedges, furniture and many different items in numerous designs will turn your piece of land into a unique vacation spot. • KEEP your garden CLEAN! Not only at the beginning will you find trash in your garden that needs to be removed, but also during the game your efforts to keep it clean will be rewarded! Mow your lawn and turn your property into a gardener’s dream. • EARN money and spend it! The more fruits and flowers you sell, the more money you have available to invest in better tools, new plant varieties and more. • HAVE FUN and experiment with realistic physics! Throw the design items around, place them as you like, build towers of fences or hedges, and do lots of crazy things you probably wouldn't do in a ""real"" garden. There are almost no limits to your imagination.","2024-05-21","/game/113716","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202304/0613/cd3a1d06e9207bffb498470712a33e901e631d7b1cbc8fed.png?w=200","8","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3550-PPSA13891_00-GARDENSIMPS5EU00","60%","14","Simulation, Casual","251.6","null","null","Garden Simulator","TRD","Toplitz Productions","2023-05-10","garden-simulator-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","629.00","0","251.60","0","",

"","2024-06-05","It’s time for the National Nightly News. A nation tunes in, and you get to decide what’s fit for broadcast. Pick the most exciting (or scandalous) camera angles, bleep the swears and determine which ads to run to keep the sponsors happy. No pressure, right? I mean, who pays attention to the news anyway? Not For Broadcast is a darkly comedic game of televised chaos that lets you pick what you want to see on TV, no matter what anybody else wants. Egotistical celebrities, dishonest politicians, and strange sponsors clash on the airwaves. You’re here to ensure that the show goes on uninterrupted. Cut between multiple camera feeds, tweak the headlines, bleep the foul language, all with just moments to spare on a live broadcast! Whether you toe the party line or stir up a scandal is your choice, so long as you can hold the audience’s fickle attention. Frame the picture (and the debate): Keep the general public entertained with your editing skills. You are the artist and the broadcast is your canvas. Keep it PG: Smash that big red CENSOR button to keep rude words (and other sensitive information) off the air. Keep the news safe for children and oppressive political regimes alike. Hand-pick the headlines: There’s more news to see than a single broadcast can possibly contain, so someone (that’s you) gets to choose what goes on air. Frame a footballer as a loving beau or a drunken lout? Your call to make, and just one of many. It’s just TV, right? It’s not like you could change an entire nation’s fate… Cue the ads: Powerful as you are, they’re really not paying you enough here. Some hand-picked (if slightly sketchy) sponsors might help pad that bank balance, and provide some laughs along the way. Customer satisfaction is not guaranteed and absolutely no refunds. The show must go on! Nothing will stop the National Nightly News, not even existential threats! Keep broadcasting no matter how bizarre things get. News stops for no-one, not even a category 5 storm! Keep them laughing as you go: Okay, so the news isn’t all sunshine and celebrity embarrassments. There’s all that talk of war, and the politics are just getting to you. But don’t worry, be happy! Tune out the chaos, turn up the ads, and whatever you do, don’t listen in on the increasingly panicked chatter of the news crew behind the scenes. Everything’s fine.","2024-05-21","/game/74860","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0614/4bae72a32b61a34c6f3ee140dbb6c1a517668e8b79c861c8.png?w=200","8","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-CUSA30757_00-0742719842801524","75%","39","Simulation","125.8","null","null","Not For Broadcast","TRD","tinyBuild LLC","2023-03-23","not-for-broadcast-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","629.00","10","157.25","1","",

"","2024-06-05","THE APOCALYPSE HAPPENED... In a desperate move to end all wars that have been rampaging the world for decades, the mages provoked The Cataclysm. Massive balls of pure magic obliterated nearly everything. A strange purple mist propagated everywhere, with hordes of bloodthirsty mutants coming at night. Our only hope is now to banish all magic from this accursed world by casting The Last Spell, requiring several days of uninterrupted incantation whilst a few strained Heroes try to protect those damned mages. The Last Spell is a tactical RPG with roguelite elements in which you have to defend a city against hordes of deadly enemies. During daytime, prepare your Heroes, carefully choose how to rebuild your Haven and position your defenses. Over the night, exterminate all the monsters coming at your walls with a large range of weapons and skills. Then heal, level up, and repeat until the Magic Seal is broken. FEATURES Turn-Based Tactical RPG: â—� The whole RPG package: a flurry of stats, skills, perks, traits… and more. â—� Tons of items: armors, weapons, trinkets and potions… with their own stats and skills, as well as optional random modifiers. Each weapon has its own skillset and playstyle! â—� Build your own classes: upgrade your heroes with stat bonuses and perks, and equip whatever gear you wish. Want to make a glass cannon rogue/mage fighting with a gun? Do it! â—� Manage your squad of heroes: they’re strong, but they are few and have access to limited resources. Healing and mana are scarce, so try to find a good balance. Hordes of Evil: â—� Think and adapt: you will face swarms of deadly enemies with only a few hardened heroes. Optimize your positioning and plan your actions: big AOE attacks, crowd control, buffs, poison... Every Action Point counts towards another day of survival. â—� Enemies have strengths and weaknesses that will challenge your wits. And because hard is not enough for us, be prepared for the terrifying Elites! â—� Each map will end with epic fights against unique mind-bending bosses. Protect the Haven: â—� Rebuild the city to help you in-between fights. Get healed, forge new magical weapons, get new heroes. Spend your resources wisely, commander! â—� Build up your defenses: walls, traps, towers, catapults… every tiny bit of help is welcome. â—� Protect the Magic Circle at all costs! If you lose it, humanity is doomed. â—� 5 Havens to protect, each with their own setup and challenges requiring you to tailor your strategy to beat the Great Evil. Roguelite Elements: â—� The game is meant to be hard. You will fail… A lot. But every time you do, you’ll grow harder, better, faster, stronger! â—� Procedurally generated enemy waves, characters, weapons and a ton of unlockables will keep you entertained until the real world collapses. â—� Tailor each run thanks to the Omens: a limited amount of bonuses that can be picked for the upcoming run. Do you prefer more Action Points, more characters, sturdier defenses, better loot? Experiment to find your preferred tools of destruction. â—� Scale the difficulty to your liking, with 6 levels of Apocalypse to entertain even the most crazy hardcore players.","2024-05-21","/game/93160","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0613/103bc799353f562b710a34015ca09d895ed2f64556c8b194.png?w=200","34","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5539-PPSA09525_00-2899485575378333","35%","50","Role-Playing","377.4","null","null","The Last Spell","TRD","The Arcade Crew","2023-03-09","the-last-spell-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","629.00","42","408.85","1","",

"","2024-06-05","You start in a school building where seemingly someone had birthday recently. You don’t remember what you are doing there but the environment is bright and rather unfriendly. You are a tiny bee in a giant environment and move continuously forward. You are free to fly wherever you want and explore the level to your heart’s desire. After you have played around a little and enjoyed the sensation of flying you start to discover the nearby areas and hidden secrets and find a couple of different items. For once there are energy potions which fill your energy meter to continuously fly faster until you run out of energy. Secondly there are golden flowers hidden everywhere in the levels that you can collect as a reward for exploring even the more hidden parts of the levels – collecting all of them unlocks an extra achievement in each level. Last but not least there are the bright shining knowledge shards that show you the way into the next area. Whenever you collect one the next one will spawn ahead of you and show you the right way. Once you have found a certain amount of knowledge shards you will be able to enter the next area and the story continues. Each area is another part of a world that a bee could experience and a little step further to find a new home. Therefore, each level has a different color theme, general setting, mood and story.","2024-05-21","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202212/1601/cWnJBAmv5dQG5BBoGvm0SW50.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6556-CUSA37649_00-6255035890808609","40%","0","Family, Casual, Family","149.5","null","null","Bumblebee - Little Bee Adventure","TRD","EpiXR Games UG","2023-02-09","bumblebee-little-bee-adventure-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","299.00","0","179.40","1","",

Defend your city as five unique and devastating Kaiju grow in power with every attack. Unfortunately, they can't be killed, but can be slowed down and forced to fall back... for now. Monsters move towards the nearest building, and the scientists have mathed the exact odds of where they might go next. Build sacrificial army bases and airfields to distract the Kaiju. If standard methods aren't enough, deploy experimental weapons such as freeze rays and transforming mechas to keep them at bay. Or you can always park tanks and jets in the monsters’ path to slow them down (don't worry, we have a good insurance policy). If all your efforts fail, don't be ashamed and run away! Be prepared to evacuate the laboratory using transport trucks, boats, or planes when the Kaiju get too close. Play missions from all over the world as you progress through the fight against Kaiju in a 15+ hour story-based campaign. Throughout the campaign, you’ll have the chance to gain an advantage with upgradeable ACE units and Project Deck customization. Test your wits in tactical puzzles, command dozens of units in large-scale scenarios, and fend off repeated attacks in defense missions while developing your city economically. And if you’re hungry for more, test your command skills in weekly challenges! Features: Protect your city in a tactical battle with cannon-fodder tanks, jets, and more... unusual firepower. Face five different Kaiju - each with unique skills and potential for mutation. Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Do everything to stop the monsters, including sacrificing your units and buildings. Remember that you can’t kill Kaiju - you can only slow them down. Defend cities around the world in 15+ hours of campaign mode. Prove your command capabilities in weekly challenges.","2024-05-21","/game/96325","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202210/0313/kJJT6eZ2XQEGcGnoEGuKgzh6.png?w=200","19","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA33612_00-1692968410657931","55%","0","Strategy","199.6","null","null","Kaiju Wars","TRD","Klabater","2022-11-10","kaiju-wars-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","0","224.55","1","",

"","2024-06-05","Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, in most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.","2024-05-21","/game/89898","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png?w=200","10","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-GASSTATIONSIM0EU","30%","26","Simulation","324.35","null","null","Gas Station Simulator","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2022-10-19","gas-station-simulator-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","13","349.30","1","",

"","2024-06-05","AUTHENTIC GAMEPLAY With the dual stick controls, each stick represents one of your feet. You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. ""IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN"" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels…) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones for your style and shred the most iconic spots!","2024-05-21","/game/70726","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/2412/267dcd99838eca943a1ab23184ecacde8a479ea56d9d37ad.png?w=200","3","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06510_00-SSSG000000000000","60%","49","Simulation, Sport","0","null","null","Session: Skate Sim","TRD","NACON SA","2022-09-22","session-skate-sim-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1249.00","28","499.60","1","",

"","2024-06-05","Set in an era when electricity wasn’t a thing and nothing but imaginations of great inventors that set the world in motion, LIT test your own inner engineer and lets you discover the joy of experimenting with light at first hand. - The behaviour of light in LIT is physically accurate. That said, the amazing light paths you are going to build in LIT are possible but extremely hard to reproduce in real life. Our game gives you the opportunity to set up mirrors and glass pieces to reflect and refract a light beam as you wish. - Our puzzles are open-ended. We give you the rules and the tools, you show us how to solve the problem. We assigned a number of possible solutions to each level but don’t let those numbers fool you - we’re only waiting for the players to find solutions we haven't thought of. - Visuals threading on the thin line between cartoony and realistic. Good pacing. Relaxing music, which lets you zone in. All of that creates a unique, mysterious but warm atmosphere. - When light hits a mirror and it reflects, it hits glass and it bends. That’s all. And yet, it offers thousands of possibilities, which means each of our levels is different and unique. - LIT is extremely intuitive. Testing the game on multiple gaming events proved that it works for all age groups and all types of players. You want to find every solution and beyond? Searching for a game for your 5-year-old? Or maybe you’re trying to introduce your mum to gaming?","2024-05-21","/game/78677","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2510/PBJzMHItU2hGPBWeb1e2UfQn.png?w=200","1","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6606-CUSA33733_00-7809937728420648","40%","5","Puzzle","99.5","null","null","LIT: Bend the Light","TRD","Dmitrii Milovidov trading as OverGamez","2022-09-16","lit-bend-the-light-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","199.00","1","119.40","1","",

"","2024-06-05","A surreal and punishing world of black, white and red awaits as you challenge the void of Back Again, a hardcore 3D platformer presented in immersive first-person perspective! In this void, your only means of escape is to cross floating platforms arranged in increasingly complex configurations. Obstacles move in patterns over and around them, forcing you to learn their movements to avoid getting knocked off a ledge or halted midair. Mannequins surround you, sometimes navigating the platforms themselves or simply observing. Perhaps they hold clues about the puzzles at hand, or perhaps they are just like you. Either way, they offer little comfort. Back Again is an eerie tale with a minimalistic narrative and unsettling atmosphere intended to test your skills, question your psyche and reward your determination, all set to a unique and ever-changing soundtrack to suit the mood. See the story to its end, retrying each sequence as many times as it takes, and once you’ve built up enough confidence, choose Survival Mode to see if you can clear the entire game in a single attempt! Features: • Walk, run and jump across platforms in a harsh 3D puzzle-scape! • Navigate shifting obstacles by learning their patterns. • Witness creepy events and engage in a light narrative! • Get immersed with a unique ever-changing soundtrack. • Push your platforming skills to the limit in Survival Mode!

"","2024-06-05","Hell Pie is an obscene 3D platformer that takes bad taste to the next level! The game sees you grab the horns of Nate, the ‘Demon of Bad Taste’. He is given the honorable task of gathering the disgusting ingredients for Satan’s infamous birthday pie. To do so, Nate must venture out into the overworld and do whatever it takes to ensure those ingredients are secured in time, or there’ll be hell to pay! Luckily Nate isn’t alone on this quest, his ‘pet’ angel Nugget is there to offer support.

Nate can also equip horns he finds across the world to give him new hellish abilities.

Freedom: Use the extensive moveset to overcome obstacles the way you want. Stuff: Collect things! Lots of things! Hell and above: Explore 4 big worlds and survive challenging platforming levels. Fashion: Buy outfits. You're the demon of bad taste and should look the part.

"","2024-06-05","Paradox Error is a surreal take on the scrolling platformer format, combining minimalistic black-and-white presentation with self-aware, fourth wall breaking design. Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they’re part of the stage. The title screen’s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player’s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you’ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you’re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward. Features: • Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world! • Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective. • Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive. • Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style. • Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!","2024-05-21","/game/99099","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1807/7dfibDJZKkgabUv92WYt1h7E.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2005-PPSA06061_00-PARADOXERROR0000","70%","1","Action","37.5","null","null","Paradox Error","TRD","eastasiasoft","2022-07-14","paradox-error-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","125.00","0","37.50","0","",

"","2024-06-05","A unique first-person life simulation game of a lumberjack building up a business and founding his own dynasty. Lumberjack's Dynasty is a unique mix of forestry, logging and life simulation combined with role playing elements. You start at a run-down logger camp which you slowly take over from your aunt and uncle to bring it back to its former glory. Besides the pure “lumberjacking” you can solve a large variety of quests and train many skills to become better and more professional along the way. You can always and freely adapt your way of playing: Either quickly become a straightforward and professional lumberjack by purchasing, cutting and converting large forests into products – and, thereby – into your economic success without getting sidetracked too much. Alternatively, you can take more time to explore the full depth of the game and also let yourself experience the vast variety of additional possibilities - ranging from repairing and renovating your buildings and vehicles, over fishing, making honey, and growing vegetables to socializing with local folks, finding the love of your life and eventually founding your own family. Either way, a lot of fun (and hard work) is waiting for you while taking care of your life while growing your company and transforming both into a successful Lumberjack’s Dynasty. Features • Unique mix of forestry, logging and life simulation in first person view • Quest driven story line • Large, open world • Plenty of individual characters to interact with • Adaptable gameplay with huge variety of tasks • Skill system – learn and improve your skills to become better and more efficient • Economic system with different products and varying prices • Control heavy machinery and vehicles • Manufacture and sell logs, planks, bark and other wooden products • Repair, rebuild and expand your home and other buildings • Repair and work on specific vehicles • Take a rest from your lumberjacking and follow other activities such as fishing, growing vegetables, collecting fruit, making honey and cooking delicious meals • Earn social points and money as (partially interchangeable) currencies to further expand and develop your business • Find a wife and raise a family • Grow your Lumberjack’s Dynasty by making the right decisions","2024-05-21","/game/78100","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/0607/PNqIKutXZfpFBCc3mHQbOLKR.png?w=200","55","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3550-CUSA32418_00-LUMBERJACKSDYNEU","65%","160","Simulation, Role Playing Games","262.15","null","null","Lumberjack's Dynasty","TRD","Toplitz Productions","2022-06-30","lumberjacks-dynasty-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","749.00","100","262.15","1","",

"","2024-06-05","This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game. The Shadowrun Trilogy comprises 3 cult tactical RPG games taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which magic has re-awakened, bringing back to life creatures of high fantasy. Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades. Shadowrun Returns The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Nearly 10 years ago, creator Jordan Weisman returned to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return… Shadowrun Hong Kong - Extended Edition HONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world’s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. As an ex-con living in Seattle, you try to make an honest living but when your foster begs you to meet him in China, things turn grim and you find out the police are trying to arrest you. And by arrest, they mean to kill you on sight! Build your team of Shadowrunners, mercenaries with big personalities who can fight using mystical or technical powers, and turn the tables on the elite corporate and the police.

"","2024-06-05","Survive, gather resources, expand your crew, improve your starship, and pave the way through outer space – full of hostile races. Your path will consist of difficult choices and everyone will have an influence on the outcome. …and perhaps you might be able to solve the mystery of this universe. FLYING AMONG THE STARS You are the commander of the “Melistar” (“The Star Bee”), and you have a swarm of intelligent anthropomorphic bees. Your ship is your home, and your mission is to keep an eye on its fighting ability to repel enemy attacks; to stay on course, and to effectively collect resources to ensure that both the Queen and soldier bees have enough food; and, of course, to keep an eye on the status of your crew, whose members strive to get into trouble or arrange it. OTHER SPECIES The ship travels through an amazing universe full of strange insectoid races. Who you’ll be forming an alliance with, and who you’ll be fighting with, is largely up to you! The Merchant Guild fights the League of Smugglers; the intelligent Ants compete with Locusts for space colonies; the sinister cult of Blood Suckers spreads across the galaxy... We’ll have to fight and trade – and every one of these decisions can be a turning point in the story. SURVIVAL AND STORYTELLING * You can try your hand at surviving. Space cycles alternate, resources run out – and the crew increases; but luck and accurate calculation are on your side! Competently upgrade your ship and set the right course – and you can stay alive for a certain amount of time, or maybe even break a record! * If you like branching plots and world exploration – boldly immerse yourself in the storyline. The CyberHive universe is a mysterious and deep setting. Collect ancient artifacts and pieces of knowledge on distant planets about the past – and discover how the world turned out to be and what misfortune it faces. Maybe you can avert it... or not. MANY EVENTS As you try to find resources and survive, you will experience many events on the ship: from intrigues within the crew and problems with passengers, to a large contraband “set-up” or a collision with the ghost of a legendary pirate starship. Some events form a story, and some occur randomly.

Immortus Temporus is a game created by a speedrunner for those who love to hone their skills through practice, trial and error, determination and relentless replay. Stages have numerous ways to beat them. Crashing into hazards will deactivate them and teleport the player back to the spawn point, allowing free passage from A to B, but is that the fastest route? The actions you take in Immortus Temporus persist through death, whether it’s collecting a pick-up or destroying an obstacle. Levels only reset when you run out of time. Each attempt will challenge you to outperform yourself, to think outside the box and break the game!

Your owner's naughty son destroyed your aquarium, and now you're desperately in need of water! Use what little liquid is left on the floor to move around and retreat to a toilet bowl which might save your life or flush you down into far more challenging realms, escaping which will require all of your agility and creativity! There are two ways to traverse the levels in Blow & Fly, rolling and blowing. You can roll along the floor and blow water out of your mouth, thus launching yourself in the opposite direction. Every time you hit the floor, you regain a small amount of liquid, just enough to get yourself into the air again. Utilize this ability to avoid hazards such as pitfalls or spikes, and make good use of the jump pads, gravity switches, keys and water drops to reach each watery safe haven. If you wish to survive, you will need to master your abilities, and for each obstacle you pass, there will be a greater challenge ahead! Features: • Experience an accessible yet challenging puzzle adventure! • Master precise physics-based controls to traverse levels. • Use water blasts to fly through the air or roll along the floor! • Conquer more than 70 levels of gradually increasing difficulty. • Find secret areas and collect pearls awarded for clever play. • Unlock new playable fish as you progress!

It's your decision, as long as you can sate your Hunger for blood. GAMEPLAY WITH CONSEQUENCES With its unique gameplay, Swansong puts emphasis on the consequences of your actions in both the investigation and your social interactions with other characters.

You’re not defenseless - equip your own weapon and experience the satisfaction of picking off a sniper mid-air, nailing your landing on the edge of a skyscraper, then flowing straight into a wall-run to line up your next target! Of course, if the enemies are too much to handle, you can always disable them and focus on pure parkour. ARCADE MODES Endless mode Infinite level generation provides unlimited challenging terrain.

A dreamlike journey into a surreal world of the artist’s own creations where the atmospheric gameplay provides mysteries to discover, puzzles to solve and artistic landscapes to explore. GAMEPLAY You find yourself on an evolving island. As you investigate your surroundings, the island will start to change. The appearance of a ship, the rise of a lighthouse, each mystery you uncover and puzzle you solve will unfold new wonders and unveil new places to explore.

Buildings were falling, churches were burning, and everything was to be washed away forever. A painter lived there, isolated from the outside world.

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naivetÃ© of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","2024-05-21","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/oiWObCmIi2HWJ2AUnHfc7P7a.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCODELUXE000000","85%","0","Action, Adventure","224.85","null","null","Sherlock Holmes Chapter One Deluxe Edition","TRD","FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","2021-11-15","sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1499.00","0","224.85","1","1",

"","2024-06-05","This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game. In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness. The game’s cutscenes, quirky cast of characters, and the majestic Pacific Northwest vistas have been enhanced for an experience that delivers as much on its visual impact as its unnerving atmosphere.

"","2024-06-05","Swamp Defense 2 is a classic tower defense game with unique weapons and monsters as enemies for any beginner or defensive specialists. Fight countless enemies with a huge selection of gun turrets (in the form of comic heroes) and additional helpers (mines, air support, block wall) on more than 60 maps. Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters! TD features: - Shop system for buying and improving towers and for purchasing special weapons - 9 defense towers, capable of improvement (2 improvements each within a battle) - Support towers, special attacks and elements that can be placed along the path - Unique opponents - 54 unlockable maps + 9 bonus maps - Tower control (control of direction and aim of a tower) - Power-up for each tower: damage, rate of fire, range - can be placed along the path: mine, adhesive cream fence, block wall - Supporters: fire power expansion, range expansion - Global help: area bomb, atomic bomb, air support","2024-05-21","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/2613/bdp8UO0BPwqmISYwRdksYEMK.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5974-CUSA29997_00-6112691195656490","50%","0","Strategy","50","null","null","Swamp Defense 2","TRD","THOMAS CLAUS UND FRANK MENZEL","2021-09-09","swamp-defense-2-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","125.00","0","62.50","1","",

"","2024-06-05","Order of Battle: World War II is a turn-based strategy game with an impressive variety of scenarios and theatres of war. Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders – split between Generals, Pilots and Captains – is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow. FEATURES Classic turn based, hex based gameplay with an intuitive UI and great depth. Play in dynamic campaigns with unit carryover and multiple ""what-if"" scenarios. A rich 3D world with detailed animations and effects 20 different Specializations give a unique feel to each faction including Banzai Charge, Bushido Code and even the Manhattan Project. Over a thousand different unit types, including infantry, tanks, ships and aircraft, each with unique visuals and animations Attach unique commanders to your units to give them additional offensive and defensive bonuses A deep but intuitive supply system allowing breakthroughs & encirclements.","2024-05-21","/game/63464","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1812/6vfDdBCOEsxM7cwPshdYlmYB.png?w=200","39","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4136-CUSA14680_00-OOBWWII000000001","55%","0","Strategy","224.55","null","null","Order of Battle: World War II","TRD","Slitherine","2021-08-19","order-of-battle-world-war-ii-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","0","224.55","1","",

"","2024-06-05","Strategic Mind: The Pacific is a turn-based strategy set in the WW2 period depicting the war between the USA and the Empire of Japan waged in the Pacific Ocean with mindblowing historical accuracy and attention to detail. It offers an immersive experience of commanding both sides of the conflict, allowing you to gain a unique understanding of the situation through the eyes of both sides' top commanders, resulting in enjoyable and insightful gameplay. Build up, train, and equip your troops with the newest weaponry available to maximize their efficiency and set sail for victory. The core element of the game is large-scale naval battles with numerous carrier ships bringing so much more aircraft into the battle for seizing control over the ocean. Upon overtaking the sea you will have to set foot on hostile land through a series of costly landing operations. You will have to make your naval, aerial, and amphibious forces act as one flawless mechanism - a task only a truly strategic mind can achieve. Key features: - Play both sides of the conflict to gain a unique insight into the epochal events of the War in the Pacific: the United States of America defending both its global power and its ideals; and the Empire of Japan fighting for the right to take the future of our world into its hands. - You can decide which ships, submarines, and aircraft will constitute the bulk of your force.

"","2024-06-05","The story It’s the year 1976. We’re in a dystopian reality in which the Nazi army ended up defeating the Allied Front and winning the Great War. In this apocalyptic parallel universe, Hitler has declared himself Supreme World Chancellor and, what’s even more terrifying, Tyrolean pants are all the rage across the globe. However, there’s still hope. Despite the scarcity of resources, the Allied resistance’s brightest scientists, led by the eccentric Dr. Ivan Ivanovich, have made the impossible possible: they’ve built a time machine. Thus, thanks to the Quantum Air Combat Simulator, the Virtual Reality prototype designed by Dr. Ivanovich, you’ll have the opportunity to travel back in time and take part in the most momentous air battles of World War II. But pay attention! Playing with quantum reality and altering the path of history can have the most unforeseen consequences… Classic Essence / VR Technology Sit in front of the huge 3D Quantum Simulator screen, fasten your seatbelt and relive the magic of legendary vertical scrolling titles. Alternate the “classic” point of view with the first-person perspective while performing impossible maneuvers to dodge enemy fire. Be amazed by the dynamic scenario elements that will pop off at you. Never has a simulation seemed so real and fast-paced. Air Combat / Immersion Zones As Ivanovich Games already did in the successful “Operation Warcade”, all the scenarios in “1976: Back to Midway” include several Immersion Zones, which allow the player to move inside the aircraft cabin, offering new and thrilling challenges. An experience that only Virtual Reality can provide. Take control of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the B-17G Flying Fortress exact replicas, test your pilot skills, become a flying ace, and change history forever.

"","2024-06-05","Paradox Error is a surreal take on the scrolling platformer format, combining minimalistic black-and-white presentation with self-aware, fourth wall breaking design. Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they’re part of the stage. The title screen’s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player’s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you’ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you’re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward. Features: • Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world! • Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective. • Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive. • Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style. • Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!","2024-05-21","/game/99099","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1807/7dfibDJZKkgabUv92WYt1h7E.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2005-CUSA27949_00-PARADOXERROR0000","70%","1","Action","37.5","null","null","Paradox Error","TRD","eastasiasoft","2021-06-08","paradox-error-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","125.00","0","37.50","1","",

WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression.

You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion.

Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.

Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage... Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don’t worry though, as any crafting progress you’ve made is retained from one to another.","2024-05-21","/game/67475","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202004/0922/c2PFv5RzqHZ4L87K6BuGxnQW.png?w=200","8","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3717-CUSA16300_00-VOIDBASTARDSGMEU","70%","28","Arcade, Strategy","224.7","null","null","Void Bastards","TRD","Humble Games","2020-05-07","void-bastards-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","749.00","13","224.70","1","",

"","2024-06-05","Grab the Bottle is a quirky puzzle game in which you solve puzzles by stretching your arm through the level. You need to maneuver an ever-extending arm to grab the goal bottle, avoiding anything hazardous on the way. To make things more tricky, Grab the Bottle brings physics and puzzles to the mix. You must grab, pull and drop objects to get to the goal bottle. On the way you will find different kinds of obstacles that need to be dealt with. The story of the game begins in the 50s, somewhere in rural America, where one particularly strong minded baby is taking his first steps and discovers that anything is possible. Especially as he seems to have an infinitely stretchy arm. Grab the Bottle follows the life of this boy, from cradle to grave, solving many levels of puzzles inspired by “real life problems” on the way. Central element to the story is the specific craving for bottles the main character has. 1 player 510MB minimum save size HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Jon Lockhart walked through the prison gates a free man, after spending years imprisoned as the supposed murderer of an old friend. He returned once more to the city where it all started intent on figuring out who it was that framed him for the murder and make them pay in blood for the crime.

Embark on an ever-changing journey, build your own bestiary, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash special powers. Become a master of the Living Ink, grab your quill and build your unique strategy time after time so that you can be named the greatest Inkulinati of all time! INKULINATI IS INSPIRED BY REAL-LIFE MEDIEVAL MARGINALIA 700 years in the making, finally these bizarre art pieces can come alive in a video game and show that medieval people also had their “memes” and that they laughed from the same silly things that we do today. You’ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more… FIGHT LIKE AN INKULINATI Inkulinati are a legendary group who battle one another on the pages of medieval manuscripts. They fight by drawing Beasts with the Living Ink. Thanks to this magical substance, those creatures come to life and an epic battle ensues.Move your Beasts across the battlefield, perform actions on or with them, make tactical use of obstacles and collect more Living Ink to draw new Beasts which allows you to gain an advantage over your opponent. MULTIPLE DEADLY (AND BIZARRE) BEASTS TO UNLOCK Donkeys playing trumpets with their bottoms, bishop cats vanquishing heretics with prayers, heavy but deadly snails that eat units alive, and more.

Just remember - your opponent can do it too. ADAPT YOUR TACTIC TO EVERY BATTLE Each Inkulinati has its own army, with different Beasts, who in turn, have different abilities, strengths, and unfortunately, weaknesses (or fortunately - depending which side you’re on). But it’s not just the armies that can influence who will win any given duel. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. You will have to use your wits and adapt your strategy to beat the opposing Inkulinati’s army on each specific Battlefield. A SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN Uncover the mystery and secrets of Inkulinati and face such opponents as Death, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure!

During your journey you will learn the secret techniques of drawing new Beasts and Inkulinati Hand Actions, allowing you to choose the composition of your army. You can be a brave knight that has no fear and will send his loyal troops straight at his opponents. Or perhaps you would like to play with a bit more tact? In that case, you can be a nun who with the power of prayer can confuse her enemies and heal thy own servants. Those styles, and more, are waiting to be discovered and made your own.

Every case has different requirements and with a wide variety of agents to choose from, finding the right agent for the case is essential. Expand your roster to accommodate more agents by completing caseloads and receiving rewards. Cases Whether it's security, repossession, fugitive recovery, or moonlighting, careful reading and planning are the keys to success. Ascertain the specific case requirements and bring your A-game to the table by sending the right agent to get the job done. Dice Each agent has 5 stats with different values, ranging from 0 to 5. The value corresponds to the number of dice allocated when performing a stat roll. Puzzles Some cases offer diverse and immersive gameplay with genre and era-specific puzzles (read: mini-games). They are a mixture of cryptograms, digital and analog mechanics: reflex-based as well as mathematical challenges. Gear Cards By using cards, stat values are temporarily increased for dice rolls. Gear Cards have a tier value which indicates the rarity of the card, as well as a durability factor, indicating the total amount of uses the card has before it is removed from the inventory.

You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it! FEATURES ARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically of off surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail. Advanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall. ARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island and Scorched Earth are released now, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis. The definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond.

What if you could buy them both at once, together in some sort of combined bundle? Does that calm you down a bit? Are you okay now? You were freaking us out a bit. But now that we’ve explained this bundle situation you’re looking a lot better. Mind if we continue? If you don’t know what you’re getting into, here’s the deal: High On Life is an action-packed comedy-adventure FPS filled with unhinged talking guns, an evil alien drug cartel selling humans on the black market, and an impressive variety of gorgeous and seedy spacefaring locales to explore. You wanna buy goop from a back-alley salesman? You wanna tell some construction workers that their dad will never love them? You wanna rescue a talking knife from a bunch of a gang of ant clones? You can do ALL of those things in High On Life, trust me. And a lot more. I didn’t even mention a lot of the other stuff you can do. And then there’s High on Knife, the meaty DLC centered around that talking knife I mentioned earlier. Knifey. His name’s Knifey, and this is his big adventure. He’s gonna find out all about the dark(?) mysterious(?) secrets(?) of his past as you take him and Harper, a brand new talking gun, to a salt-planet filled with dying slugs. And then from there maybe you’ll meet a giant guy, race some slow-as-hell slugs, or go for the high score in Peroxosquash with B.A.L.L., another new talking gun. We really packed this DLC full of new stuff, trust me. And we didn’t even get to the spooky parasite-filled shipping warehouse run by a ruthless, monstrous CEO. I should also mention that this bundle features an all-star cast of comedic voice talent guaranteed to put the “funny” back in “wouldn’t it be soooo funny if you bought this bundle right now?” We’ve got JB Smoove, Tim Robinson, Betsy Sodaro, Sarah Sherman, Michael Cusack, Gabourey Sidibe, and so many more who are now mad at me because I didn’t put their names in here but, look, I’ve got a word limit I’m working with. I can’t just put all the names in here. Blame the storefront. It’s their fault, not ours. Just buy the bundle.

Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That’s what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience without equal. Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement. The Tightest Crew The legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. Ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, one born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake. In order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan. Give in to your greed Give outlet to your greed and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash and jewelry and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics and accolades. It won’t be as simple as showing up and gaining goodies. You’ll have to work hard and plan smart to get away with as much loot as possible. Gain experience, unlock new skills and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges. The Art of Heisting A professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays. Thrive in Co-op Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends in mind, whether you bring them from your childhood or make them along the road. The PAYDAY-series has always valued the bonds made through hardship and tries to reflect that in the actions and words of our heisters while in the game, and through our community while on the outside.","2024-05-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2909/a1a027289fadb563ddc04c1a3ec0f2b7f4f9f8dd7fe378c2.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8459-PPSA14411_00-PAYDAY3GOLDSIEE0","40%","0","Shooter, Action","1349.4","null","null","PAYDAY 3: Gold Edition","TRD","PLAION","2023-09-21","payday-3-gold-edition-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2249.00","0","1349.40","0","",

"","2024-06-12","This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game. The Two Point Studios Double Pack features both critically acclaimed games - Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. Also includes Two Point Hospital's first four major DLCs, Bigfoot, Pebberley Reef, Close Encounters and Off the Grid, along with two item packs, Exhibition Items and Retro Items. Two Point Hospital Build, cure and improve! Build up a hospital from nothing to a masterpiece as you design the most beautiful – or functional – healthcare operation in the whole of Two Point County. Optimise your hospital design to increase patient (and cash) flow, arranging corridors, rooms and waiting areas to your exact specifications. Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible. Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in. Cure unusual illnesses! Don’t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, you’ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism – each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine. Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. Once you’ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut. Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next? Two Point Campus Build your university, your way! It’s time to spin academia on its head! Got a yearning for learning? Or just keen to build an educational masterpiece? Two Point Campus is jam-packed with new creative tools to help you build the university of your dreams. For the first time, build on the outside as you develop a blank canvas of greenery into your own delightfully educational campus environment, housing the top teaching facilities in the land. Lay down pathways with new easy-to-use tools. Plant glorious collections of outdoor flora. The only limit is your imagination (and your in-game bank balance). Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies. Build libraries, hire the best staff, kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked! But it’s not just work hard. Oh, no. It’s play hard, too. You’ll need to keep an eye on their happiness and make sure they’re getting enough entertainment, pastoral care and general joie de vivre to develop into incredible individuals who will do the legacy of your university proud. If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

"","2024-06-12","This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game. It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.

Explore the mansion floor by floor as you seek to unravel the story behind this bizarre place, with each run giving you the opportunity to collect another piece of evidence to be added onto your Evidence Board. The Mansion also hosts a mysterious cast of characters who may help or hinder your progress on each run... Features • Creepy and Thrilling storyline unfolds (pun intended) as you progress in the game and unlocks different endings depending on your performance • Game mechanics designed for high replayability • Perma-death • The more you fail and start over, the more you learn about the mechanics • Unique AI for each enemy type - unexpected behaviours - makes enemies creepier and more fearsome • Logical puzzles are designed to make the player think • Collectible Upgrades • Customize your equipment before each run to shape your own play style Run by run, Paper Cut Mansion will offer you the opportunity of defining your playstyle as you unlock new abilities and discover new equipment that will give you a better chance of overcoming the challenges each procedurally generated run throws at you. Each new item offers further customisation to your ultimate build, allowing for truly unique set ups. Do you want to get in close as a melee fighter or take shots from afar as a ranged marksman? Set yourself up with a drone who can do the fighting for you or create an engineering build who can lay down traps and turrets as you back enemies into them. Completing quests will also grant you temporary perks, making each run feel fresh as you may not get the same perks to choose from next time! The possibilities are endless and there is no correct way to overcome the ever-shifting procedural rooms of the mansion. The mansion itself also has a dimension-hopping twist. Each floor contains portals that lead you to alternate versions of the same location. Each dimension switches up the aesthetics and gameplay. You always start in the NeoCortex dimension, which plays out like an escape room, filled with challenges, puzzles and surprises. From there, you will receive quests that take you into the Reptilian Complex and the Limbic System Dimensions. In the Reptilian Complex, the mansion takes on a fiery appearance as it is overrun with monsters. The Limbic system sees an icy chill overtake the mansion. You’ll need to move quickly and stay near heat sources as the cold damages you on your search for hidden items or torches to light up. With a variety of enemies, clues, quests, secrets, loot and compelling logic puzzles scattered throughout the mansion, there is always something intriguing to discover on each run. There’s always something for you to keep track of - from kit upgrades, puzzles that need solving or quests to complete. Between each level a musical interlude will reveal more of the twisting story, with decisions you make throughout your run subtly affecting the final outcome - with 27 different possible endings wrapping up the tale. All this, combined with its incredible aesthetics, makes Paper Cut Mansion a roguelite you won’t want to miss.","2024-05-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/0809/Js4dKo2XYj1sdyw8t1hJhAcm.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5360-PPSA09516_00-PAPERCUTMANPS5EU","65%","0","Horror","149.7","null","null","Paper Cut Mansion","TRD","Thunderful Publishing AB","2022-12-05","paper-cut-mansion-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","499.00","0","174.65","1","",

"","2024-06-12","Construction Simulator has returned – larger and more impressive than ever! Fulfil your ambition to become a successful construction entrepreneur by establishing your business from scratch, assisted by your mentor Hape. Tackle intriguing projects of different sizes and requirements that help you increase your income, so that you're able to add even more powerful machinery to your vehicle fleet. Along the way, diverse clients will test your abilities as you navigate challenges, making every task a test of your skill set. Get ready to showcase your process as you tackle a variety of construction challenges in this dynamic and engaging adventure! Start your business on two individual maps inspired by landscapes in the USA and Germany. Each of them offers its own campaign that helps you climb the ladder of success. Friedenberg is based on picturesque cities of Southwest Germany, and features enchanting rolling hills and scenic riversides. Here, your objective is to contribute to the design of renewable energy solutions and enhance the local urban infrastructure throughout the campaign. Beyond these significant undertakings, you'll encounter diverse tasks that allow you to put every piece of equipment you earn to the test. Sunny Haven, on the other hand, is a truly American-style harbor city that you have to revitalize to put its tourism industry back on track. Altogether, more than 90 exciting contracts are waiting to be completed on both maps, so you can be sure you'll always come across something new to explore! Dive back into the construction scene with a vehicle fleet that will leave you awestruck by its sheer size! Take your pick from a selection of over 80 machines from official licensing partners, all of which are faithful virtual recreations of their real-life counterparts. Look forward to a colorful mixture of vehicles from previous installments of the beloved franchise, as well as completely new additions to the game. The same goes for the manufacturers behind them: In addition to the well-known Construction Simulator partners Atlas, BELL, Bobcat, Bomag, CASE, Caterpillar©, Kenworth, Liebherr, MAN, Mack Trucks, Meiller-Kipper, Palfinger, Still, and the Wirtgen Group, you now have the opportunity to put machines by Benninghoven of the Wirtgen Group, CIFA, DAF, Doosan, Nooteboom, Scania, Schwing Stetter, and Wacker Neuson to use. Plus, while creating your character, you can choose an outfit featuring officially licensed personal protection equipment from our new partner Engelbert Strauss. You think that's everything? Far from it: The updates Construction Simulator has been provided with since its release not only contain patches, but free extra content too. Several new machines have found their way into the game, including the innovative wheel excavator EW100 by Wacker Neuson and a practical service vehicle for refueling and repairing. New tools and features in the form of enhanced terrain reworks, increased vehicle hall capacity, and a handy flashlight are also part of the updates. And since we don't want you to get bored by taking on the same jobs over and over again, an entirely new tourist area as well as various seasonal contracts have been added on top. All in all, with the initial base game and its updates, Construction Simulator now offers you more than 100 contracts, over 90 machines, and, consequently, almost endless construction fun, which you can experience together with up to three friends in the multiplayer mode. Sounds good, doesn't it? Then what are you waiting for?

"","2024-06-12","Get the full Dying Light 2 Stay Human experience with Reloaded Edition and the free ‘Bloody Ties’ DLC. Please note: DLC must be downloaded separately. It’s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE INFECTED Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.","2024-05-28","/game/57425","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/1512/35ead9b7fd1de13c76c33914969c350dc4149e5b7bb0e5d9.png?w=200","24","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2GAME0000000EU","50%","97","Unique","999999","null","null","Dying Light 2 Stay Human","TRD","TECHLAND SP.

Walking down The Longest Road on Earth will only take you two hours, and it’s worth every step. THE SONGS OF LIFE An original, intimate soundtrack with themes and lyrics that seek the serenity and simplicity of life is included in each ticket to ride on The Longest Road on Earth.

No dialogue or text means that you can share moments of time with the characters and create your interpretations.

Music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to the Tetriminos themselves—pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you're playing, making any of the game's 30+ stages and 10+ modes something you'll want to experience over and over again.

Over 30 different stages, each with its own music, sound effects, graphical style and background that all evolve and change as you play through them. • The Zone is an all-new mechanic designed just for Tetris Effect: Connected! Includes the all-new “Zone” mechanic, where players can stop time (and Tetriminos falling) by entering “the Zone” and either get out of a sticky situation that could otherwise lead to “Game Over,” or rack up extra Line Clears for bonus rewards. • Cross-platform multiplayer lets you play with players from all over the world! Players on different platforms can easily join Friend Match rooms with the new Room ID feature. • A wide variety of competitive and co-op modes!
