Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","SaleStarted":"2023-09-13","LowestPrice":"/game/87808","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA24159_00-MAKAIRE000000001","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F177-VTSGSM","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":10,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":14.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Title":"Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Capcom U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-01","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-ps4-us","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/1fqS8WIVGr","IsPS5":0,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":6,"SalePrice":14.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2023-09-28","description":"To commemorate the 15th anniversary of the sword fighting action game series Onee Chanbara, the events of THE Onee Chanbara and THE Onee Chanbara 2 have been completely remade in full HD.

The new lodgers are restless spirits, big on wailing and generous with the ectoplasm. No one knows how to die tastefully these days. Where's the subtlety? These are the dangers of jumping into anything, even death, uneducated. Haunted by unwelcome and undead spirits, the estate needs your help for a new lease on the afterlife. WHAT\u2019S INCLUDED \u2022 A New Campus Location \u2022 2 New Courses \u2022 2 New Fully Animated Classrooms \u2022 2 New Student Archetypes \u2022 A New Challenge Mode Level \u2022 And Lots Of New Items NEW LOCATION Lifeless Estate The lawn may be lacklustre, and the surfaces strangely gooey, but all of the problems come back to the ghosts. You could say that possession is nine tenths of its flaws. There, I've said it. The last heir to the estate, Lady Lifeless had hoped to spend her after-years catching up with her reading and floating tastefully around the garden. Instead, her rest is routinely ruined by rude spirits with even worse table-manners. Tackle the paranormal pest problem, learn what it means to be dead and help the estate rest, peacefully, once again. NEW COURSES Paranormal Detection There was debate in the County for a number of years, surrounding the existence of ghosts. Thanks to science, that debate is now long finished: ghosts are a real and genuine nuisance. You can't wipe away the regrets and resentment of vengeful spirits, but now you can bottle them up\u2026 a bit like they did. School Spirits Being dead isn't as easy as everyone makes it seem. It's hard to rest in peace with a life & death's worth of questions on your mind. \"Where am I?\", \"Why did I say that one thing when I was 24?\", \"Did I leave the oven on?\" etc. Fortunately, you can learn anything in Two Point County, even how to be dead. ALSO \u2022 Expulsion Ceremonies - Have students cleanse a new area for campus construction by running an Expulsion Ceremony to remove the unwelcome spirit residing there. \u2022 Hauntings - Some ghosts may haunt a specific room, causing unnecessary student suffering. Send in your trusty trained janitors to de-haunt the room and capture the ghost. \u2022 A brand new Challenge Mode level - train janitors and de-haunt rooms to capture as many ghosts as possible in a year-long battle with the dead.","SaleStarted":"2023-09-13","LowestPrice":"/game/125528","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/1316/3c778f12287facea9d5c1258e903dea6d750d342593a6885.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-PPSA03645_00-CAMPUSDLC02NA000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Simulation","PlusPrice":2.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/1316/3c778f12287facea9d5c1258e903dea6d750d342593a6885.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Two Point Campus: School Spirits","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"SEGA of America, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2023-03-15","Slug":"two-point-campus-school-spirits-ps4&ps5-us","IsPS5":1,"Price":5.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":2.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-28","description":"Spice up your hunter life with this third pack of additional content!

This story takes place three years after the events of the previous game \u201cAtelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout,\u201d and depicts the reunion of Ryza and her friends, who go through new encounters and goodbyes to discover a true priceless treasure. 《The Story》 Three years have passed since Ryza\u2019s secret grand adventure on Kurken Island. Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life. 《Main Features》 ■ Exploring with new field actions! Ryza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively. ■ More action-filled real-time battles! Take on your enemies using an improved \u201creal-time tactics\u201d battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever. Speedily switch between characters, choose varied skills, and utilize items in just the right moments for best results. ■ Straightforward and easy-to-use synthesis! Utilize several new synthesis systems, including the new intuitive \u201cLinkage Synthesis\u201d system where items are placed in cells called \u201cMaterial Loops\u201d, that are designed to allow both new players to easily learn synthesis, and experienced players to create unique customized items. Created items can also be mixed and matched with \u201cEvolution Link\u201d to create entirely new items.
