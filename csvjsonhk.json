        "Desc": "Ghost of a Tale is an action-RPG game in which you play as Tilo, a mouse and minstrel caught up in a perilous adventure. The game takes place in a medieval world populated only by animals, and puts an emphasis on immersion and exploration. It features stealth elements, disguises, conversations with allies and enemies, and quests.<br /><br />You'll be able to explore the secrets of Dwindling Heights Keep and navigate its dangers. Tilo is not much of a fighter, so stealth and nimbleness are your allies when confronted with enemies twice your size. Talk to the characters you meet and leave no stone unturned in your quest to find Merra, your true love….<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

        "Desc": "KNIGHTS AND BIKES is a hand-painted action-adventure for 1 or 2 players, set on a British island in the 1980s. It's a coming-of-age story starring Nessa & Demelza, exploring the coasts of Penfurzy on their trusty bikes, looking for a legendary lost treasure in a Goonies-inspired tale of excitement, danger, fun and friendship.<br /><br />The two new friends, along with their pet-goose and the pickled-head of an undead knight, form the Penfurzy Rebel Bicycle Club, and are ready for anything this adventure throws at them. They pedal into danger to face threats head-on with frisbees, water-balloons, video game controllers and the powerful beats of an amplified boom-box.<br /><br />Along the way they'll stuff their pockets with trinkets and barter for bike upgrades, spurring them onward down the island's country lanes, windswept beaches, deep forests, modern attractions and ancient ruins.<br /><br />Together their friendship will create an adventure as big as their imaginations.<br /><br />This product supports the following languages: English<br /><br />1-2 players<br /><br />5GB minimum save size<br /><br />HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p<br /><br />One-time licence fee to download to multiple PS4 systems.

Create deadly super chains of attacks, using each idol's skill in the right order to keep the pain coming – it'll be music to your ears!<br />4. Create performances for your idols and share them!

        "Desc": "Outlast 2 introduces you to Sullivan Knoth and his followers, who left our wicked world behind to give birth to Temple Gate, a town, deep in the wilderness and hidden from civilization. Knoth and his flock are preparing for the tribulations of the end of times and you're right in the thick of it.<br /><br />You are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch.<br /><br />You're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe. <br />The investigation has lead you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do.<br /><br />Outlast, Outlast: Whistleblower & Outlast 2 © 2017 Red Barrels Inc.<br />Developed by Red Barrels, Inc.<br />Outlast and all characters, their distinctive likenesses, and related elements are trademarks and material protected by copyright of Red Barrels Inc.© 2017.

Their dynasty has been watching over Asposia for centuries on end. In secret, they fill the roly-poly world with light and life. But when their existence is discovered, they become hunted. Emil, a trader for odds and ends, made all the Asposians believe that the dynasty is in cahoots with dark forces. The only one who can stop the evil Emil is the heir to the throne: Robert. He has been petrified for three years, though. With a huge dose of enthusiasm, but little to no idea what he's actually doing, he embarks on an adventure to find the legendary last wind monk. Of course, he has some great company: Peck, as loyal as he is flightless, and Laura, a rebel who certainly does fly, but only off the handle - and who Robert loves, with a capital L. Everything changes, when they meet the mysterious Mama Dola, who seems to know more about Robert's destiny than Robert would like.",

Each location has its own flora and fauna, along with changing seasons and a day-night cycle. Gemea, once a paradise, still maintains the appearance of one, yet an evil murk has enshrouded the land and its people in despair.<br /><br />As the hero you will explore Gemea, uncovering the island's secrets and the mysteries within yourself as you embark on a journey of self-discovery. On a quest to become the island's champion, you join forces with Sprites, creatures who are the only thing capable of dispersing the murk, to save Gemea and its people.<br /><br />The towns of Gemea are filled with kind-hearted residents who have faced many difficulties since the murk arrived. By contributing to the island through farming, crafting, cooking, fishing and brewing, relationships can be built with the locals, who offer everything from resources to a new farm as rewards.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",
