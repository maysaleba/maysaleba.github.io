On top of that, you\u2019ll have to utilise the wackiest kinds of blocks (magnets, rockets and even nuclear fusion are no strangers for a well-trained astronaut like yourself), and work in exotic and not-quite-monkey-friendly places.

What followed was a bloody battle on Eden where the Horsemen, obeying the will of the Council, annihilated the Nephilim.<br /><br />Still reeling from the events on Eden, WAR and STRIFE have been given a new assignment -- LUCIFER, the enigmatic and deceptive demon king, has been plotting to upset the Balance by granting power to master demons throughout Hell.  War and Strife must hunt down these masters, gather information, and ultimately fight their way through a tangled, demonic conspiracy that threatens to forever upset the Balance and unravel all of creation.<br /><br />1-2 players<br /><br />15GB minimum save size","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"THQ Nordic","ReleaseDate":"2020-02-14","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307FTDlOD7fPdfJ96GsPcv3mi5nkJwT6RkPw7INSIM7lG41u2eTT8C14jHYAIOSsSXqTC7Y6OkSD_YPXtmRzJf_PkyH-rZ.png?w=200","Slug":"darksiders-genesis-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4389-CUSA12988_00-DARKSIDERSSSUS00","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfziRNV4ujA","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"75%","Price":39.99,"genre":"Role-Playing,Action,Adventure","SalePrice":9.99,"PlusPrice":9.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"74","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/13182/far-cry-primal-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-05-26 06:59:00","Title":"Far Cry Primal","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-11 07:11:06","description":"The award-winning Far Cry franchise that stormed the tropics and the Himalayas now enters the original fight for humanity\'s survival with its innovative open world sandbox gameplay, bringing together massive beasts, breathtaking environments, and unpredictable savage encounters.<br /><br />Welcome to the Stone Age, a time of extreme danger and limitless adventure, when woolly mammoths and sabretooth tigers rule the Earth, and humanity is at the bottom of the food chain.

Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny.<br /><br />In Evertried, the player\'s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success.<br /><br />You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension!<br /><br />Test Your Strategic Might<br />Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy.<br /><br />Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills<br />Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don\'t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level.<br /><br />Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny<br />The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top.<br /><br />Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses<br />Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.","ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-21","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png?w=200","Slug":"evertried-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4127-CUSA28069_00-EVERTRIEDPS4US00","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImOYOo4RR4","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"40%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Strategy","SalePrice":11.99,"PlusPrice":11.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-26 06:59:00","Title":"Expand + Soundtrack Bundle","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-11 08:11:27","description":"Expand is a 2D indie game in which you guide a pink square through a circular labyrinth that constantly rotates, unfolds and expands around you.

Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.<br /><br />The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.<br /><br />What\'s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\'ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.<br /><br />They don\'t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\'ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\'t happen but marketing text is hard to write.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Team Meat LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-19","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/1209/bhgDakvgeEnnYx3kinsfd3cw.png?w=200","Slug":"super-meat-boy-forever-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1055-CUSA16602_00-SUPERMEATBOYFORE","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKjjyDUgGd8","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"45%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Action,Platformer","SalePrice":10.99,"PlusPrice":10.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"74","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/137948/transformers-battlegrounds-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-05-26 06:59:00","Title":"Transformers: Battlegrounds","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-11 08:10:08","description":"With evil MEGATRON close to capturing The Allspark, BUMBLEBEE and the Autobots need a new commander to help restore peace \u2013 you!<br /><br />Assemble your squad and roll out for a battle that will rage from Central City to Cybertron.

The story takes place in the land of Rin during the height of the Age of Sail, following the events that would lead to the greatest war in human history.<br /><br />STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin.<br /><br />POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player\'s party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history.<br /><br />CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character\'s unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle.<br /><br />PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total. This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2022-02-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png?w=200","Slug":"rise-of-the-third-power-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4127-CUSA28517_00-R3PUS00000000000","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8e4bk3jh0U","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"25%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Role-Playing,Adventure","SalePrice":14.99,"PlusPrice":14.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-26 06:59:00","Title":"Ruined King: A League of Legends Story - Deluxe Edition","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-11 08:10:10","description":"Receive the following downloadable content when purchasing the Ruined King: A League of Legends Story - Deluxe Edition<br /><br />- Ruined Skin Variants for all playable Champions: Miss Fortune, Illaoi, Braum, Yasuo, Ahri, & Pyke<br />- Lost & Found Weapon Pack<br />- Ruination Starter Pack<br /><br />Rise Against Ruin<br />Unite a party of League of Legends Champions, explore Bilgewater and set sail for the Shadow Isles to uncover the secrets of the deadly Black Mist.<br /><br />Developed by Airship Syndicate and featuring the art style of legendary comic book artist Joe Madureira, creators of Battle Chasers and Darksiders, Ruined King: A League of Legends Story is the first Riot Forge game that invites you to explore the League of Legends universe.

Getting all games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT\'s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem. Immerse yourself in the brutalist, concrete world of SUPERHOT. Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world. You can be truly free.<br /><br />SUPERHOT<br /><br />Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It\'s just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.<br /><br />SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE<br /><br />Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT\'s signature power fantasy.<br /><br />You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they\'re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched.<br /><br />Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel.<br /><br />You take a moment to consider. You\'ve been here before. So many times. <br />Maybe this time it will actually mean something.<br /><br />SUPERHOT VR<br /><br />Decisive winner of dozens of VR Game of the Year awards, SUPERHOT VR is a title reimagined and redesigned from the ground up for VR and hand tracking controllers.

Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what\'s going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You\'ve always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago.<br /><br />But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don\'t get upset... you see they\'re not stuck there forever, if you\'re up for a bit of an adventure!<br /><br />You see, deep in the Outback, there\'s this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open!<br /><br />Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there\'s just this one SMALL problem. You see there\'s this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who\'s also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn\'t think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he\'s ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you\'ll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans!<br /><br />Don\'t worry though, you won\'t be alone! You\'ll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie.
