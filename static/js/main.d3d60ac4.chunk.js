Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5\'s hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before.

Assume the leadership of a medieval noble family, increasing its power and reputation through the generations. As one ruler dies, they are replaced by an heir who may have very different abilities or interests, forcing you to adjust your long term plans. Play a master of the battlefield, conquering your enemies, or play a subtle seeker of secrets, using plots and poison to advance your agenda - all in the same game. Arrange marriages, champion the faith and establish new empires in this modern classic - unlike any other strategy game you\u2019ve ever played on console. HISTORY Choose a royal or noble house from a number of realms on a map that stretches from Iceland to India, from the Arctic Circle to Central Africa. Guide a dynasty through the centuries, ensuring the security and power of each new generation. Gather new lands and titles to cement your legacy. Be a pious king to bring the religious powers to your side, or strike out on your own, designing your own splinter religion and earning everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Knights, peasant revolts, pilgrimages, Viking raiders... experience the drama and pageantry of the Middle Ages! CHARACTER Adopt one of five different lifestyles, perfecting your skills in military strategy or kingdom management. Acquire character traits that will guide your actions, but beware if you act against your nature! The stress from denying your truest self could bring a new host of troubles! Choose appropriate guardians for your heirs, or train them yourself. But what do you do if the legal heir is not quite up to the job? Violent characters may develop a fearsome reputation, cowering your timid subjects into obedience with the dread you inspire. WARFARE Recruit men-at-arms units and powerful knights to supplement your royal levies. Research new technologies to increase the wealth and military might of your realm. Hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major wars. Supplement your income with ransomed prisoners or raiding parties on neighboring realms.

Climb Dharma Tower, humanity\u2019s last shelter, after a world-ending cataclysm. Make your way up from the bottom to the top, confront the tyrannical Keymaster, and take your revenge. The streets of this tower city are full of violence. Mara the Keymaster rules with an iron fist and little regard for human life. As resources diminish, the strong prey on the weak and chaos threatens to consume what little order remains. The decisive last stand is coming. A final attempt to set things right before mankind goes over the edge of extinction. As the most advanced blade fighter ever created, you\u2019re always outnumbered but never outclassed.

Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what\u2019s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment. DRIVE TO SURVIVE It\u2019s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It\u2019ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating.

Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is \u2018nothing ventured, nothing gained\u2019 \u2014 some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places.

Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You\'re stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you\'ll have to reach The Core, but you can\'t do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it\'s also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You\'re going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you\'ve got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you\'re set, enter the Station to take on a character\'s quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You\'ll likely die trying, but hey, that\'s the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There\'s tanky Bunker who\'ll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who\'ll heal her squadmates with her \\"unusual\\" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you\'ll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you\'ll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESS\xe2\u201e\xa2 Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN\', THE MORE GROWIN\' Hate to break it to you, this won\'t be easy and you might die\u2026 a lot. But that\'s okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again.

BREAK THE CYCLE Will the nightmare of the war ever end? Will you find inner peace one day? In Ad Infinitum, you play as a German soldier haunted by the horrors of the Great War. While your mind grapples with memories of your family home and the trenches on the front, you try to break the endless cycle of suffering. BETWEEN A DREAM AND REALITY You wake up in your bedroom, unchanged from your teenage years, in a run-down and deserted manor house. Suddenly and inexplicably, you are transported to the trenches where the horrors of war are overshadowed by vile and even more terrifying creatures. Unable to distinguish between reality and nightmare, you must fight to regain control of your life\'s narrative. NIGHTMARES THAT BECOME REAL Unspeakable nightmares come to life in the recesses of your mind. To escape the death traps and terrifying creatures, you must understand the source and motivation of each monster and solve the puzzles that stand in your way. From blind demons who can hear your softest footsteps to hideous disjointed puppets who move in the dark, horror is around every corner. A FAMILY TORN APART The fallout of the war is felt far from the front. Peel back the shroud that hides the secrets of your family, torn apart by the Great War, and try to remember your past. Through exploration and by solving riddles and puzzles between the walls of your home and the barbed wire of No Man\u2019s Land, you ultimately reveal a chapter in the story of a German family torn apart by war.","SaleStarted":"2024-11-17","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2909/d5ee1a502f153c1907ac066a5712618616f337cd0e1301fc.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA10600_00-AIF0000000000000","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":8,"genre":"Horror","id":"EP6665-PPSA10600_00-AIF0000000000000","PlusPrice":419.7,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/ad-infinitum","Popularity":"","Title":"Ad Infinitum","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2023-09-14","Slug":"ad-infinitum-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1399.00","MainExtra":7,"SalePrice":"419.70","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"70","SaleEnds":"2024-12-02","LowestPrice":"/game/101251","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4\xe2\u201e\xa2 version and the digital PS5\xe2\u201e\xa2 version of this game.

You\'re disoriented. Your head hurts. Things seem surreal, yet familiar. Your wife Martha and your daughter Dorie are not there. Why? Looking for answers, you explore your environment and fragments of memories. On your journey you are repeatedly confronted with riddling tasks, driven by the desire to find out what\'s going on. What happened last night? Why can\'t you think of any other thing aside from your days as a stage builder at the circus? As things get crazier and more bizarre, the lines between reality, memory, and imagination become more and more blurred and you realize: there is no going back. You have to do whatever it takes to bring this story to an end, no matter at what cost... \\"The feeling of safety is an elusive one. It\'s not over yet.\\" SETTING In REVEIL, the player is immersed into a world, designed with attention to detail, where the boundaries between reality and illusion become blurred. The setting is an authentically orchestrated environment inspired by the circus of the 60s, which soon takes on surreal features. Get a glimpse into the psyche and the past of Walter Thompson: The impressions become darker, more mysterious, more enigmatic the further you advance.

Build wild loops and hoops for a coaster like no other to attract thrill-seeking teens, research exciting flat rides to appeal to adults, or pop down cheery, adorable flat rides for families. But, you can also take things to the next level with unbelievable modules that add unique pizazz to your park. Going even further, you can adapt the entire world to your imagination by using terraforming tools to raise mighty mountains for your coasters to summit or whip up custom ride scenery using the modular building system that can be grouped, saved, and duplicated for quick and easy creativity! MANAGE AND OPTIMIZE FOR SUCCESS As a park manager, you\u2019ll discover how to cater to your audiences and perfect your ride placement, prices, and shops to appeal to each audience. Guests will need to be supported by a specialized staff that you\u2019ll hire and direct. You\u2019ll also get to decide if you want your park to stay within the more grounded and realistic side of the theme park world or leave those limits behind in search of profits! Gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of visitor enjoyment using powerful heatmap tools that will let you precisely tweak their experience to your benefit. DESIGN WITH LIMITLESS FREEDOM Finally, as the park\u2019s lead designer, you\u2019ll have limitless freedom to customize every aspect of the park. Decorate your park, create themed areas and enjoy the almost limitless possibilities of customization. Create a comfortable, cosy experience for visitors with graceful paths leading through fun and playful scenes that you can arrange using the thousands of themed scenery props available with the base game. CAMPAIGN AND SANDBOX MODES If you\u2019re new to the role of Visioneer, you can learn as you play in Campaign Mode. Are you more of a Creator or a Manager? Your Cloudstormer colleagues will help you understand every possible part of making your parks work perfectly. You\u2019ll team up with them to tackle parks in need of refurbishment and resist the schemes of Cloudstormer\u2019s main business rival, Hemlock. No matter which of these roles appeal to you the most, you\u2019ll be able to choose how you want to play in Sandbox Mode, which can be adjusted to remove all limitations by giving you infinite money or turning off the need to research new rides. However, it can also make your challenges harder by cutting your starting budget or requiring that you buy every new plot of land you want to use, like the true theme park tycoon you are! So come visit Park Beyond today \u2013 no matter which type of Visioneer you are, this will be a theme park experience you\u2019ll never forget!","SaleStarted":"2024-11-17","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/2319/L1Tor0j94UgqoEfSJNSZP7fD.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0700-PPSA01683_00-LEGEND0000000001","MainStory":15,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":99,"genre":"Simulation","id":"EP0700-PPSA01683_00-LEGEND0000000001","PlusPrice":999999,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/park-beyond","Popularity":"","Title":"Park Beyond","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BANDAI NAMCO ENTERTAINMENT EUROPE","ReleaseDate":"2023-06-15","Slug":"park-beyond-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":18,"SalePrice":"346.17","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"65","SaleEnds":"2024-12-02","LowestPrice":"/game/118233","description":"Explore the corners of a surrealistic post-human world to give life on Earth a second chance in this touching story about sacrifice, and hope. Play as Gaia, the Spirit of Life, and navigate stunning platforming environments in an abstract world to salvage the souls of extinct animals. Revive these creatures after learning their final fate: the last whale harpooned, the final eagle caged, the last deer hunted down, and more, while you survive encounters with dangerous, oil-covered Devourers that roam the wasteland in search of remaining life. In this emotional journey from the creators of the critically acclaimed Arise: A Simple Story, you alone can restore life to the planet. Key Features: \u2022 Gaia\u2019s journey: the last animals have died, and Mother has used all of her Life Force to save their souls, now trapped in their vessels. Gaia\u2019s quest is to rescue each of their souls and bring them back to Mother\u2019s Ark. Gaia\u2019s traversal abilities will allow you to glide, jump, and dash to explore new areas and evade deadly traps, while her special gifts will grant you the power to clear the oil that consumes the world, face hungry Devourers, and break souls free. \u2022 A vast, surrealistic world: see through Gaia\u2019s eyes the desolated landscapes that depict the destructive relationships between humans and nature in a beautiful demonstration of abstract artistry. From dying forests to the heart of crumbling cities, through the dry seabed and polluted skies, each environment will offer new challenges for Gaia to face and will present her different versions of the Devourers\u2019 wake of destruction as she spreads life and beauty on her path. \u2022 A story of contrasts: After Us offers a somber look at a world decimated by human impact. As you guide Gaia\u2019s light through it and discover the causes behind the destruction, you will learn the fate of the Devourers as agents of extinction, but also agents of progress, love, and hope.","SaleStarted":"2024-11-17","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202304/0312/293739904a7a7ce07856d5e3324f6e3dcd1e3602fb442425.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4829-PPSA07949_00-AFUS00000000SIEE","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":11,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP4829-PPSA07949_00-AFUS00000000SIEE","PlusPrice":0,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/after-us","Popularity":"","Title":"After Us","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE UK","ReleaseDate":"2023-05-23","Slug":"after-us-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1925.00","MainExtra":11,"SalePrice":"635.25","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"64","SaleEnds":"2024-12-02","LowestPrice":"/game/101567","description":"Ed Miller, writer, came out unscathed from his car crash down into Brody Canyon, California.

We invite you to join us on a journey into madness, where each encounter could be your last. With each step you take closer to unravelling Derceto\'s mystery, the eyes that watch from the darkness grow hungrier. Every bullet means the difference between survival and an unthinkable end. The next door you unlock could lead to a nightmarish realm offering nothing but slashing claws, grasping tentacles, and frayed sanity. Journey to interbellum Louisiana, where an era of decadence hides a darker tale - of escape from past traumas and an intolerant society, into the waiting grasp of something darker, something that has patiently lurked for impossible eons. This is Alone in the Dark as you\'ve never seen it - a skillfully-woven narrative of Southern Gothic elegance and eldritch madness that pays homage to its legendary origins while taking the next step forward in survival horror storytelling. A Haunting Tale of Mystery and Madness Step inside Derceto Manor, an asylum shrouded in intrigue, guarding a terrible secret. Client Emily Hartwood and private investigator Edward Carnby embark on a harrowing quest for answers; Emily to the mystery of her missing uncle, Edward to the toughest case he will ever face, and both to questions they dare not ask themselves. This re-envisioned classic invites you to explore an unforgettable single player adventure rich with suspense, frights, and revelations that will test the limits of your imagination. Featuring Hollywood Talent Experience some of the greatest acting survival horror has ever seen through the performances of award-winning actors Jodie Comer (Killing Eve, Free Guy) and David Harbour (Stranger Things, Black Widow) in their first videogame roles. Jodie and David\u2019s immaculately captured likenesses breathe life into Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby, lending a deeply personal aspect to Alone in the Dark\u2019s story that demands it be played twice to get the full experience. A Tribute to Horror Pioneers Rediscover the essence of psychological horror in a game that respectfully nods to its 1992 origin, the game that established the survival horror genre. Alone in the Dark is your gateway to an experience steeped in the atmospheric dread of classic horror, with next-generation storytelling and gameplay. A must-play for fans of twisted tales, nerve-wracking exploration, and desperate combat.

Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as mysterious dangers await. Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria\u2014known as Khazad-d\xc3\xbbm or Dwarrowdelf\u2014in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there\u2019s clatter, there\u2019s combat.

Make use of glimmers and combos in battle; meet a diverse cast of races, including monsters, mechs, and vampires; and experience your very own story, created through your choices and actions. Distant Worlds Woven Together: Travel to 17 unique worlds from the Junction, either led by the hand of destiny or by a path forged by your own choices. Discover the completely different cultures and landscapes, ranging from a densely developed forest of skyscrapers and a green and luscious habitat covered in plant life to a world governed by five witches, or one ruled by vampires - just to name a few of the distinct settings. An Eclectic Cast of Protagonists: Six leading characters, all from diverse backgrounds and with vastly different goals, set out on their journey in five unique story arcs. They venture to the myriad of worlds for their very own personal reasons: One, a human on a mission to protect the barrier defending his city; another, a witch trying to regain her lost magic while maintaining her disguise as a schoolgirl; and yet another, a vampire lord out to regain his crown and reclaim the throne as the rightful king of his world. Even selecting the same protagonist for a second--or third or fourth--playthrough will lead to completely new events and stories, a completely fresh path and experience. A Story of Your Very Own Making: SaGa Emerald Beyond has the greatest number of branching plots of any game in the SaGa series. The story branches abundantly depending on your choices and actions. Every time you visit a world, the story will evolve, allowing the protagonist and player alike to discover new possibilities. As the story unfolds in this way it becomes a tale all of your own, not only affecting the path you walk but also the multiple potential endings that await each protagonist. Battles where a Single Choice Can Change Everything: SaGa Emerald Beyond further refines the highly strategic Timeline Battles the SaGa franchise has been long renowned for. With series mainstays such as the skill to spontaneously acquire abilities through the Glimmer system, tactical ally placement known as Formations, and United Attacks that enable individual skills to connect together to form devastating chain attacks, it offers the best iteration of SaGa\'s turn-based combat to date. The new combat system adds more drama than ever before, allowing you to support party members, interrupt enemy actions, and use United Attacks by strategically manipulating the order of ally actions. The characters that join you, the weapons you wield, your party formation, and your tactics in battle - everything is up to you!","SaleStarted":"2024-11-17","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/1110/3e091ae115b4cad403eb9f591e3c59cc1488ac656c9a4e0d.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0082-PPSA16123_00-SAGAEMERALDBYDEU","MainStory":13,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":57,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP0082-PPSA16123_00-SAGAEMERALDBYDEU","PlusPrice":1049.4,"Popularity":"","Title":"SaGa Emerald Beyond -","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Square Enix LTD","ReleaseDate":"2024-04-24","Slug":"saga-emerald-beyond--ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1749.00","MainExtra":29,"SalePrice":"1049.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-12-02","LowestPrice":"/game/82916","description":"Our story begins in one corner of Allraan, a tapestry of nations with diverse cultures and values.

Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring \xe2\u201e\xa2, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn\'t dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas\' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-d\xc3\xbbr and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself\u2026 or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn\'t break; he bends, he adapts\u2026 Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It\'s up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","SaleStarted":"2024-11-17","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0314/3bfea22d60d10ee2ba3ab64ffbfe95a53ee9a133d0fcc77e.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG0000000000000","MainStory":13,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"85%","Completionist":18,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG0000000000000","PlusPrice":999999,"Popularity":"","Title":"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\xe2\u201e\xa2","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2023-05-25","Slug":"the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"2099.00","MainExtra":15,"SalePrice":"314.85","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-12-02","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4\xe2\u201e\xa2 version and the digital PS5\xe2\u201e\xa2 version of this game.

Once you\u2019ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut. Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next? Two Point Campus Build your university, your way! It\u2019s time to spin academia on its head! Got a yearning for learning? Or just keen to build an educational masterpiece? Two Point Campus is jam-packed with new creative tools to help you build the university of your dreams. For the first time, build on the outside as you develop a blank canvas of greenery into your own delightfully educational campus environment, housing the top teaching facilities in the land. Lay down pathways with new easy-to-use tools. Plant glorious collections of outdoor flora. The only limit is your imagination (and your in-game bank balance). Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies. Build libraries, hire the best staff, kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked! But it\u2019s not just work hard. Oh, no. It\u2019s play hard, too. You\u2019ll need to keep an eye on their happiness and make sure they\u2019re getting enough entertainment, pastoral care and general joie de vivre to develop into incredible individuals who will do the legacy of your university proud.

Rather than controlling any one character, you only need listen to their conversations, following along as the story evolves. Use the information you hear to match names to voices and determine how everything (and everyone) is related. Can you discover the truth? Open-Ended Narrative Mystery Game Explore the story and piece together the puzzle in your own way! Don\'t expect to be \\"fed\\" a pile of clues. Rather, take the role of a fly on the wall, observing and listening to the events as they unfold. Anyone could be the culprit; key clues may be revealed at any second; any character\'s storyline may cross paths with another at any point in time. YOU be the editor\u2014the order of the story is up to you!","SaleStarted":"2024-11-17","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/2202/0VlGMlUQJNTiVRUcI30EIA7P.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6804-CUSA37443_00-UNHEARD000000000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Unique","id":"EP6804-CUSA37443_00-UNHEARD000000000","PlusPrice":209.4,"Popularity":"","Title":"Unheard \u2013 Voices of Crime Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"505 GAMES S.R.L.","ReleaseDate":"2023-03-21","Slug":"unheard-voices-of-crime-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"349.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"209.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-12-02","LowestPrice":"","description":"Dress to impress with the Deceive Inc.

Please note: DLC must be downloaded separately. It\u2019s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz\'s torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor \u2014 the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You\u2019ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall \u2014 a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there \u2014 a horde of relentless zombies. DAY\u2019S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT\u2019S FOR THE INFECTED Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems\u2026 fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it\u2019s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let\u2019s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.","SaleStarted":"2024-11-17","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/1512/35ead9b7fd1de13c76c33914969c350dc4149e5b7bb0e5d9.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2GAME0000000EU","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Unique","id":"EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2GAME0000000EU","PlusPrice":0,"Popularity":"","Title":"Dying Light 2 Stay Human","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TECHLAND SP.

Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind.

You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica\'s oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful. After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft knives, lights, diving gear, and personal water craft. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items. Build bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.
