Experience thrilling adventures in four totally different worlds: â Explore a freaked out laboratory where Bismo and Plom had their accident! â Uncover the secrets of the overgrown green forests... â ... and survive the dry canyons where a deadly wind awaits you\u2026 â ... just to prepare you for the bitingly cold caves! The twist: Shift Happens is pure fun for solo players, yet its full potential can only be experienced together. Play it with your best friend while hanging around on a couch enjoying a pizza.

The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Renovate and decorate train stations and trains. Detailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements. Build your own station. Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TrainStationRenovation_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/train-station-renovation-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"8.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHoo9Hg5OZA","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"85%","Completionist":"17.5","genre":"Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.85","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TrainStationRenovation.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"34.20","BrazilPrice":"14.39","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.igdb.com/games/train-station-renovation","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Train Station Renovation","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Forever Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-06","Slug":"train-station-renovation-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"6.99","ChilePrice":"","Price":"18.99","MexicoPrice":"58.49","MainExtra":"13.5","SalePrice":"2.84"},{"CanadaPrice":"6.24","SCORE":"80","SaleEnds":"2022-05-05","LowestPrice":"4.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-14","description":"The TakeOver is a side-scrolling beat'em up inspired by the genre defining classic games of the 90's.

Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's novella At the Mountains of Madness, but largely set after the original story. You, as Frank Gilman, open your eyes inside a room filled with strange, pulsating noises. Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you\u2019re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near the South Pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister... Explore the Antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues and unlock secrets, whilst avoiding macabre beings at all cost. Key features: A deep and suspense-filled Lovecraftian story with lots of secrets and Easter eggs. Ominous but wonderful graphics created with Unreal Engine 4. Multiple endings. A haunting and atmospheric soundtrack.

When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park. It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece. Â· LOCAL CO-OP Â· 39 Days to Mars is a two player co-operative game. The HMS Fearful is a masterpiece of unreliable engineering, therefore Albert and Baxter will need all the help they can get. Nothing can be done without the effort of both players, who have important roles to play in the adventure. Â· SINGLEPLAYER AI Â· For the solo voyager, the ship's computer-controlled cat will keep you company. Without a second pair of hands, Albert will need an extra dose of dexterity to navigate the challenges of Victorian space flight. Â· BITE-SIZED ADVENTURES Â· The mix of action and thoughtful puzzles make it perfect for playing in short sessions. The entire adventure fits comfortably into an evening, or a long tea break. Â· ATMOSPHERIC Â· Be drawn into the world of Albert and Baxter by the unique illustrated artwork. 39 Days to Mars has a rich sound-scape and a beautiful piano score that is punctuated only\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_39DaysToMars_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/39-days-to-mars-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"1.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oqrxPYnHhM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"33%","Completionist":"6.5","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Multiplayer,Party","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"16.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_39DaysToMars.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"199","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.igdb.com/games/39-days-to-mars","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"39 Days to Mars","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Its Anecdotal","ReleaseDate":"2019-05-16","Slug":"39-days-to-mars-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 2 players","PolandPrice":"49","ChilePrice":"","Price":"14.99","MexicoPrice":"133.99","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"10.04"},{"CanadaPrice":"18.61","SCORE":"60","SaleEnds":"2022-04-25","LowestPrice":"13.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-11","description":"Peru-ve yourself on the Picchu and win those Machus!

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.

The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles. Leveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area. Players are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far. The type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animus-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"4.5","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"65%","Completionist":"0","genre":"Action,Role-Playing,Arcade,Fighting","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"4.54","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"45.50","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"ANIMUS","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"TROOOZE","ReleaseDate":"2019-01-03","Slug":"animus-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"13.29","ChilePrice":"","Price":"7.99","MexicoPrice":"52.15","MainExtra":"5","SalePrice":"2.79"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.84","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-12","LowestPrice":"2.79","SaleStarted":"2022-04-21","description":"These are the days before Ire: Blood Memory, the days when Kerr the Breaker\u2019s evil slipped its way into Cadmeia.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality.
