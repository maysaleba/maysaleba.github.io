Music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to the Tetriminos themselves—pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you're playing, making any of the game's 30+ stages and 10+ modes something you'll want to experience over and over again. Plus cross-platform multiplayer modes for competitive and cooperative play! • Close your eyes to enter the ZONE With PS VR2 eye tracking enabled in the game options, you can enter the ZONE by closing and then opening your eyes. • PS VR2 headset feedback Transport yourself into the world of Tetris Effect: Connected where you can feel key moments in gameplay. Transitions are physical as you move between Journey Mode stages. Feel the jolt of the haptics as you go into and out of the ZONE. • Enhanced haptic feedback New vibration settings utilize the new dual-actuators of the DualSense PS5 controller and the PS VR2 Sense controllers adding a new layer of sensory stimulation. • An exhilarating single-player experience full of surprises. Over 30 different stages, each with its own music, sound effects, graphical style and background that all evolve and change as you play through them. • The Zone is an all-new mechanic designed just for Tetris Effect: Connected! Includes the all-new “Zone” mechanic, where players can stop time (and Tetriminos falling) by entering “the Zone” and either get out of a sticky situation that could otherwise lead to “Game Over,” or rack up extra Line Clears for bonus rewards. • Cross-platform multiplayer lets you play with players from all over the world! Players on different platforms can easily join Friend Match rooms with the new Room ID feature. • A wide variety of competitive and co-op modes! Among the new modes is CONNECTED, where three players can team up and literally connect their Tetris Matrices to fight against A.I.-controlled Bosses; Zone Battle, a one-on-one match of standard competitive Tetris, but with a twist: the time-stopping Zone mechanic; and Score Attack and Classic Score Attack,” two single-player versus modes where two players compete separately to see who can get the best score. • Join in on the fun in Spectator mode! Spectator mode is available in Friend Matches. A room can contain up to 8 total people. Spectators can use emotes during the match to liven up the competition. • Transfer save data from the PS4 version to PS5 Download and transfer your PS4 save data to the PS5 using cloud or extended storage or connect to the same network and transfer data directly from PS4 to PS5.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane’s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.",2023-05-28,/game/68258,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200,16,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA,75%,34,Action,0,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/deathloop,DEATHLOOP,TRD,Bethesda,2021-09-13,deathloop-playstation-tr,https://shope.ee/1ArSDNa2S0,1,599,23,149.75,0

Assume the leadership of a medieval noble family, increasing its power and reputation through the generations. As one ruler dies, they are replaced by an heir who may have very different abilities or interests, forcing you to adjust your long term plans. Play a master of the battlefield, conquering your enemies, or play a subtle seeker of secrets, using plots and poison to advance your agenda - all in the same game. Arrange marriages, champion the faith and establish new empires in this modern classic - unlike any other strategy game you’ve ever played on console. HISTORY Choose a royal or noble house from a number of realms on a map that stretches from Iceland to India, from the Arctic Circle to Central Africa. Guide a dynasty through the centuries, ensuring the security and power of each new generation. Gather new lands and titles to cement your legacy. Be a pious king to bring the religious powers to your side, or strike out on your own, designing your own splinter religion and earning everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Knights, peasant revolts, pilgrimages, Viking raiders... experience the drama and pageantry of the Middle Ages! CHARACTER Adopt one of five different lifestyles, perfecting your skills in military strategy or kingdom management. Acquire character traits that will guide your actions, but beware if you act against your nature! The stress from denying your truest self could bring a new host of troubles! Choose appropriate guardians for your heirs, or train them yourself. But what do you do if the legal heir is not quite up to the job? Violent characters may develop a fearsome reputation, cowering your timid subjects into obedience with the dread you inspire. WARFARE Recruit men-at-arms units and powerful knights to supplement your royal levies. Research new technologies to increase the wealth and military might of your realm. Hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major wars. Supplement your income with ransomed prisoners or raiding parties on neighboring realms. INTRIGUE Use your spymaster to discover plots against your dynasty and your rule. Recruit agents to assist your schemes to undermine or murder anyone who stands between you and power. Seduce other characters for love or political power.

83,2023-06-12,"December 2021, Tokyo district court. Akihiro Ehara stands accused of groping a woman on a crowded train. A bystander’s video footage of his attempt to flee the scene and subsequent apprehension is all over the news, and public outcry demands a maximum sentence. “Three days ago, a dead body was found in an abandoned building in Yokohama. Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room. His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further. How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice? From just a single stumble, one can become a monster… LAW AND DISORDER - Lost Judgment once again puts players in the sneakers of lawyer turned street-fighting detective Takayuki Yagami. Joined by his partner, ex-yazuka Masaharu Kaito, the crime-fighting duo is called on to investigate a seemingly perfect crime whose lead suspect has an airtight alibi. What starts out as a tale of revenge reveals a tangled web of conspiracy involving several unlikely factions taking advantage of a broken law system. But as victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, he must choose between defending the law or exacting justice. FREEFORM COMBAT - Yagami’s distinct martial arts forms grant him mastery of any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Harness Crane, Tiger, and the new Snake stance, a graceful style that can deflect and return an opponent's strikes, using their energy against them. INVESTIGATIVE ACTION - Yagami’s arsenal of detective tricks grows with new gadgets, stealthily tracking suspects, and crafty methods of infiltration. Leave no stone unturned in pursuit of the truth. NO PLACE FINER – Immerse yourself in the bustling downtowns of Tokyo and Yokohama at your own pace within an authentic setting that only the RGG Studio can deliver.

As Redgi, heir to the Rat Throne, you must restore your broken Kingdom by banishing the merciless Frog Clan and their ferocious leader, Greenwart. As you explore the deceivingly charming world, you’ll encounter a cast of unique companions, ready to aid you in your adventure. And you’ll need all the help you can get, whether that’s new meal recipes, blueprints to forge deadly weapons and armour, or even a land-chugging, armour-plated mole mobile! Overcome your fears. Rescue your brothers. Restore Your Kingdom. Your tail has begun… Master Brutal Combat From frog zombies to gargantuan grubs - and everything in-between - the Kingdom is awash with danger. To overcome each perilous encounter, you’ll need to study your opponent’s attacks and react accordingly! Thankfully, there’s a range of deadly abilities at your disposal, including parry bashes and fatal executions, not to mention ranged attacks with your nifty bow and arrow. Explore a Treacherous Kingdom Fully accompanied by the deep, raspy narrations of Doug Cockle, prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the mediaeval-fantasy Rat Kingdom. Complete side quests and faction hunts for some additional gold-on-the-side, or join forces with a sharp-eyed companion to help even the playing field. Customise your Attack Adapt Redgi’s combat style to the task at hand. Heavy armour may provide better protection but can you really afford to slow down your dodge-roll? And then there’s the question of weapon; axes pack a punch, while spears are quick and nimble. Perhaps you’d prefer the all-round performance of a trusty broadsword? Overcome Savage Boss Fights While danger lurks around every toadstool, you’ll need to keep your wits sharp and your blade sharper when it comes to the devastating boss fights. Cold-blooded in every sense of the word, these oversized amphibians each present their own unique combat challenge, and you’ll need more than a good set of armour to come out on top. Brew Recipes, Craft Weapons, Forge Armour Redgi’s keep is also home to his brothers, Rem-Rem, Bam-Bam and Dug. Rem can cook up a health-boosting feast with ingredients found throughout the world, while Bam can craft new weapons and armors from special blueprints you’ll uncover… if you look hard enough. And then there’s Dug, who’ll update you about new quests available throughout the Kingdom. Features: - Master brutal combat, inspired by the souls-like genre, featuring dodge-rolls, parry bashes, and fatal executions! - Explore a vast and treacherous Kingdom, comprising six distinct biomes, each with its own hidden paths and secrets. - Immerse yourself in the compelling story, narrated by the deep, raspy Doug Cockle. - Customise your attack style with a vast array of distinct weapons and armour. - Assemble a band of brave companions, ready to aid you on select missions. - Complete side quests to earn additional gold-on-the-side. - Unearth special blueprints to forge new and powerful weapons. - Collect rare ingredients to cook up health-boosting feasts. - Overcome savage boss fights against the Frog Clan’s deadly, oversized generals. - Lose yourself in the gorgeous and lovingly-crafted 2D hand-drawn art style.

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before. France, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. EXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other. ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL Use ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target. HIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION Use workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal. INVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP Invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation. TENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER Customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode. ENHANCED KILL CAM More realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.",2023-05-28,/game/101756,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2116/59jHCjMBRhuRhPUKUUy2gkNd.png?w=200,10,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4529-PPSA04444_00-SNIPERELITE50000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVPeSJSkopk,50%,39,"Fighting, Action",999999,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2116/59jHCjMBRhuRhPUKUUy2gkNd.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/sniper-elite-5,Sniper Elite 5 PS4™ & PS5™,TRD,REBELLION DEVELOPMENTS LTD,2022-05-25,sniper-elite-5-ps4--ps5-playstation-tr,https://shope.ee/2VMpnNkfmW,1,529,19,264.5,1

That’s right – we’re doing this again. The baa has been raised, and Pilgor is joined by other goats too. You can invite up to three friends in local or online co-op, create carnage as a team, or compete in mini-games and then not be friends anymore. Get ready for another round of udder mayhem.

,2023-06-12,"Labyrinth of Zangetsu is a 3D Dungeon Crawler RPG by Acquire. It features a team of skilled warriors from all over the world who have been sent on a mission to defeat the ever-growing numbers of Ink Beasts. A World Blackened By The Ink Of Ruin The story is set in Ido, city of the morning moon, which continues to fight against the disaster known as the ‘Ink of Ruin.’ The city has a very traditional culture similar to medieval Japan and is essentially a fortress, with its protection coming from a strong magical technology boundary. This boundary resonates directly below the moon shining overhead, keeping everyone safe from being tainted. Will You Take Up This Quest? Tokinokuni, the city's leader, has commissioned a quest for carefully selected individuals from all over the world, known as ‘Ink Destroyers’, to go to the most dangerous areas. They will use their unique powers to conquer the various ‘Ink Beasts’ that are so feared by the people still left wandering at large. Investigate the labyrinths surrounding Ido and use your strength and strategy to guide your team to victory and ultimately conquer this nightmarish darkness. The Enemies You Must Overcome The Ink Beasts are born from the Ink of Ruin's taint. If the living encounter it, they will go mad, become demons or perish, and if the dead encounter it then they will be resurrected to roam and increase their numbers. Their only goal is to destroy and envelop the land with darkness, so you must overcome their stain to free this world once and for all from their destruction. These Ink Beasts will take on the form of many frightening demons and yokai from Japanese folklore and also raise the dead for their dark army, so be sure to strengthen your will before facing this enemy. Key Features -Uniquely illustrated visuals with hand drawn, jet-black ink brush strokes, very reminiscent of traditional Japanese calligraphy. -6 playable heroes pre-programmed into the game, plus the option to create your own heroes with unique individual stats and abilities. -Frightening enemies based off traditional Japanese folklore and Yokai (ghosts, ghouls and demons). -Turn-based battles with various Ink Beasts in the most dangerous areas. 3 ‘front’ characters to engage and attack and 3 ‘back’ characters to defend, support and parry. -Engaging narrative and overarching story to enjoy the successes of your gameplay and reflect upon your losses too. -Immersive and atmospheric soundtrack based on traditional Japanese music, helping to create a captivating story.",2023-05-28,/game/126255,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/2414/6Z6MbyGsm7MZF0yxW3Q5wF9h.png?w=200,24,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4293-CUSA32780_00-LABYPS4SIEE00000,,20%,0,Role-Playing,239.2,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/2414/6Z6MbyGsm7MZF0yxW3Q5wF9h.png,,Labyrinth of Zangetsu,TRD,PQube Ltd,2023-04-19,labyrinth-of-zangetsu-playstation-tr,,0,299,0,239.2,1

The only two to walk away from the cataclysm unscathed, the hapless everyman known as the POSTAL Dude and his loyal companion Champ, drive aimlessly through the scorching deserts of Arizona looking for a new place to call home. After a fortuitous gas station rest stop ends with their car, trailer home, and the rest of their worldly possessions stolen, all the Dude’s seemingly got left to his name is his canine cohort and his bathrobe, and neither of them smells all that great. However, on the horizon, the duo glimpses an unfamiliar and dazzling town that beckons to them. What untold prospects lie within? Fame? Fortune? Maybe a bidet or two? Edensin awaits.

Shrink yourself to experience your town at eye level with your townies. Farm animals such as cows, sheep, and chickens provide you with essential resources to produce food. Your hunters will find game to stalk but should beware of wild animals. In time you should begin to hire soldiers to defend against intruders and sinister pirates! On top of that you can use heavy artillery: A catapult can punch devastating gaps in the enemies' ranks! And should you run out of boulders, remember: everything you can lay your hands on can be used as ammo! Intuitive control of the environment helps you move about – you can literally crawl over the island or change your viewpoint like you would zoom on a smartphone. You'll get accustomed to ruling your empire very fast. The islands you visit during the campaign can be unlocked for the sandbox mode. You'll be able to choose whether you want to play entirely without constraints or accept challenges of your choice.

Town-planning: Unlock more than 20 unique buildings and place them freely within your village to optimize transport routes. Apply upgrades to make them better! Upgrades: Conduct research for further upgrades of your buildings. Trading: Build a harbor to have a trader's ship and begin treasuring up riches. Experience: Brush over trees, form clouds into dangerous thunderstorms, go fishing with your bare hands and talk to your townies. Interaction: Simply carry workers or resources directly to their destination to speed up the construction of buildings and production. Fight: Recruit brave soldiers, and build catapults, bows, and crossbows to protect your island from the Black Knight's raiding henchmen. Tutorial: Your personal advisor Sir Clunk-a-lot will accompany you on your virtual tour of the medieval age with valuable tips.

Whenever you need quality equipment to fight zombies in the streets of Harran, you can be sure they’ll have your back. But their story began long before the infection has taken over the world. In the early 20th century, as Volkan Machines, they didn’t have much time to lounge about either, producing a variety of arms for the best of soldiers. Now, having been found years later, the weapons’ unique design and deadly effects will support your cause as well. From all the relics we found, one is like nothing you’ve fought with before. Make room for the Gut Render, your new chainsaw! Cutting through armor like a hot knife through butter, its deadliness hasn’t withered one bit since its heyday. Gut Render comes with a bleeding effect and an increased critical damage chance too, allowing you to throw a truly bloody spectacle for your foes. Though, if you’d rather tune it down a little, take a look at the Flesh Ripper. A bit more subtle, it combines all the finesse of a blade with the lethality of a saw and a moderate bleeding effect. But there are times when you might want to keep your hands clean(-er), and for all these moments, there’s the Greaser.Pick it up to add a little vintage twist to your act, and grease zombies like a regular with this old-school SMG. Now all you need is an appropriate outfit and something to drive around with all those weapons, right? Put on the Punk'd Beret set to match your arsenal, and jump into the new Rugged Roadster buggy!

MEET THE CHICKEN POLICE Sonny Featherland and Marty MacChicken were once a legendary detective-duo, called the Chicken Police. But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before! NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them! EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...) There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor.

Armed with the mad scientist’s technology, they became a threat to the entire Valley. 01110000 01110010 01101111 01110100 01101111 01100011 01101111 01101100 The unique armored cars presented in packs are known for their perfect balance of weapons, armour and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, after starting the game, open the blueprint menu (“B” key ), go to the “Packs” tab, select the desired armoured car and press the “Assemble” button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases up to 75. Buying the pack also gives early access to several faction-specific structural parts. These parts become available immediately upon purchase and are not issued again upon reaching the appropriate reputation level. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy. When simultaneously buying a standard and deluxe pack the constructional parts and portraits are not duplicated Unique portraits provide an excellent opportunity to stand out among the survivors. Paint cans are a way to make your armored car different from the pack. Coins — is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention! When buying multiple packs, the acquired coins stack!",2023-05-28,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/2714/gpcVxc26UbtMOz4rlRyhdZkR.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4432-CUSA06859_00-EB00740000000000,,50%,,"Action, Simulation, Unique",349.5,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/2714/gpcVxc26UbtMOz4rlRyhdZkR.png,,Crossout - The Creation,TRD,Gaijin Distribution KFT,2021-08-10,crossout--the-creation-playstation-tr,,1,699,,349.5,0

Parker was once a loyal Brotherhood fighter. But the Wasteland changed him beyond recognition.

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before! NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them! EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...) There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor.

Every autumn his vehicle rides in the Valley and it vanishes just like it appears — without a trace. No one knows the true story of the invisible driver. Some say that he is a soldier who strayed from his squad, still looking for his comrades. Others — that he is a scavenger, who disappeared under the rubble and who continues to search for something in the ruins of an abandoned research institute. To meet Mirage is a bad sign among the survivors. Should the collector see any value in your hardware — you will never be found. The unique armoured cars presented in packs are known for their particular balance of weapons, armour and speed characteristics in combat. To put the car in the garage, after starting the game, open the blueprint menu, go to the “Packs” tab, select the desired armoured car and press the “Assemble” button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases up to 60. Attention! Storage overflow is possible under certain conditions. Buying the pack also gives early access to some factional structural parts. These parts become available immediately upon purchase and are not handed out again upon reaching the appropriate reputation level. Some parts are one-of-a-kind, and players can only own one copy of such parts. When simultaneously buying a standard and deluxe pack the constructional parts and portraits are not duplicated. Unique portraits are an excellent opportunity to stand out among survivors. Paint cans are a way to make your armoured car unlike the others.
