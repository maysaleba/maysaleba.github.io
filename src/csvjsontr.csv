"87","2024-07-17","PLAY FROSTPUNK: CONSOLE EDITION This version of the award-winning game from 11 bit studios is tailored to give console players the full Frostpunk experience: • Thanks to the special, dedicated controller scheme all important features of the game are quickly within your reach. • The Console Edition of the game already includes all the updates that have been released since its premiere on PC. THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.","2024-07-02","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000","85%","0","Strategy, Simulation, Strategy","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/frostpunk-console-edition/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Frostpunk: Console Edition","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2019-10-10","frostpunk-console-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","749.00","0","112.35","1","",

Not me, that’s for sure! …until that moron, Dan Teapot, hired a group of professional demon hunters to banish me! I don’t even know why he has a grudge against me.

I trust you can though – my incredible charm and fascinating sense of style are more than enough to overcome any challenge! P.P.S.

That’s right – we’re doing this again. The baa has been raised, and Pilgor is joined by other goats too. You can invite up to three friends in local or online co-op, create carnage as a team, or compete in mini-games and then not be friends anymore. Get ready for another round of udder mayhem. Lick, headbutt, and ruin your way through a brand new open world in the biggest waste of your time since Goat Simulator! We won’t tell you how to play (except in the tutorial), but merely provide the means to be the goats of your dreams. KEY FEATURES: - You can be a goat - Three of your friends can be goats too, and join you in local or online co-op - No really, there are so many goats. If you want to be fancy you can wear the skins of tall goats, stripey goats, and many more. There’s a goat for everyone! - Or dress up your goat in all kinds of nonsense, from toilet rolls to tea trays. Put on a jetpack for all we care - This time we actually hired ‘game designers’ and we’re told they’ve added ‘an ok amount of content’; events, NPCs to mess with, physics, status effects, collectables, easter eggs, lies, betrayal, heartbreak - They’ve added mini-games too, lots of mini-games (seven is a lot, right?) - Who said anything about a musical? - You can be Keanu Ree... (jk, wanted to check you were still reading) - But you can be a goldfish (true story) DISCLAIMER: Goat Simulator 3 is another completely stupid game.

"68","2024-07-17","The once thriving Kingdom of Hermes has fallen to an age of calamity. Seen as the answer to all the kingdom’s ailments, alchemy became a widely used practice across the land, with denizens welcoming it into their homes, using it to enhance and heal as they saw fit. When the price of alchemy became too steep, attempts to halt its use were made, each as woefully unsuccessful as the last, with the catastrophic consequences felt across the realm. Within days, the kingdom fell to chaos, infected monsters prowling the blood-soaked streets, all hope of a cure lost. Corvus is the kingdom’s final hope, the fate of Hermes resting in his feathered hands. The truth is buried deep in the memories Corvus left scattered throughout the punishing world, and only by collecting these lost memories can the kingdom be saved, but each time he dives back in, trying to piece together the truth, all he finds is more secrets. Key Features Harness the plague: Seize plague weapons from gruesome bosses and formidable enemies, wielding them as deadly weapons. Giving enemies a taste of their own medicine will be the only way to survive the horrors that lurk in the shadows of the once thriving kingdom Embrace the Raven: Shift into your raven form during battle, throw feathers like daggers to interrupt your enemies’ attacks, and perform executions with the swiftness of a raptor. Fight your way: Upgrade and modify Corvus’ basic movements and plague weapons, build your very own playstyle, and prepare for the challenges that await in your own unique way. Unforgiving enemies: Corrupted by the plague, and mutated into monsters, enemies are twisted and incredibly hostile, challenging your ability at every turn.

"66","2024-07-17","It’s time to dust off your overalls and hitch on your toolbelt in Manic Mechanics – a chaotic couch co-op game where you and up to three fellow grease monkeys pay a visit to the car-obsessed Octane Isle. Your mission? Work your way around the island’s six neighbourhoods – from the rust buckets of Betty’s Scrapyard to the spooky shores of Banshee Bay – challenging the Master Mechanics that rule each part of town. Repair as many cars, trucks, choppers, tractors, mini-subs (and even UFOs) as possible to prove your worth in this hectic race against the clock. No two games are the same as you work your way through 30 unique garage levels, each one more challenging than the last. Completing a garage is one thing, but mastering it and beating your best score requires coordination, skill and determination. Octane Isle is a great place to visit, whether you go solo or bring along your friends. In co-op mode, up to four players work together as a finely-tuned machine, tracking their team’s best scores, unlocking new characters and discovering hidden secrets as they explore Octane Isle together. Or maybe you'll choose to head straight to the Versus Arena, split into teams and decide once and for all which crew truly rules the workshop? Whether you choose co-op or competitive, the action unfolds across local, wireless and online play. Just about anything can happen on Octane Isle... the faster you work, the more chaos is unleashed. Fuel ignites, tyres explode, robots short-circuit, cows stampede and aliens abduct, but with teamwork, skill - and maybe just a little luck - you'll earn the right to call yourselves a Manic Mechanic!","2024-07-02","/game/130461","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/1217/0294dbfc7dc1e7d7e066e4b535deb26be7bbd922692ce90e.png?w=200","2","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8733-CUSA44406_00-0738875014798914","50%","5","Casual, Family, Party","299.5","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/manic-mechanics/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Manic Mechanics","TRD","4J Studios Ltd.","2024-03-06","manic-mechanics-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","599.00","2","299.50","1","",

You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat your dreams have finally come true! Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky's the limit! Disclaimer Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.

It tells the story of a young nun who sets off on a journey of self-discovery with the most unusual, horn-headed companion by her side. On the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance—as she speaks with the devil himself. Indika’s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery. The world she discovers can only be described as a wild combination of comedy and tragedy straight out of the novels by Dostoyevski and Bulhakov. ENJOY AN INDIE GAME WHERE EVERYTHING GOES The subjects of religion and authority are prevalent throughout Indika’s journey and she’ll be faced with many questions along the way. Guide her to find the answers one by one before she can finish her life-defining odyssey. Odd Meter is a small, independent studio formerly based in Moscow and now operating out of Kazakhstan.

It's in 3D with a customizable camera, and the goal of the game is to dodge various obstacles trying to prevent you from reaching the end of each level. The game features 50 levels that gradually become more challenging and introduces new obstacles to overcome. There are also 3 distinctive game modes for players who finish the game, so they can enhance the experience further. Each level has its own unique timed challenge which you will have to beat. It forces the player to think out of the box and find a way to finish the level on time. Max lives — you start with just 3 lives. It may seem easy at the start, but as the levels become increasingly challenging, dying three times means the level restarts from the beginning! Good luck ÃƒÂ°Ã…Â¸Ã¢„Â¢‚ No checkpoint — last but not least, our favorite is the no checkpoint mode. The name is kinda self-explanatory: there are no checkpoints.

Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies.

"","2024-07-17","Weedcraft Inc explores the business of producing, breeding and selling weed in America, delving deep into the financial, political and cultural aspects of the country's complex relationship with this troublesome and promising plant. Would-be marijuana moguls will need to prioritize resources carefully as they manage the production and distribution of their weed. Cultivate killer plants, cross-breed them to create unique strains of the devil’s lettuce, hire and manage a growing staff, and be prepared to take on the competition. As in real life, the business of bud presents plenty of opportunity along with a plethora of problems. Decide when and where to take on extra risk to maximize profit, but be careful, the cops and politicians are all working their own angles. An important, controversial topic presented in an insightful and detailed manner, Weedcraft Inc presents a challenge to those who would rule the reefer, offering a series of diverse scenarios and unique characters to work with (or around) as your budding empire grows. Whether you choose to hobnob with politicians, pay off the police, fight for medical marijuana rights or work the legal system, it’s all in the name of the sticky icky and your cutthroat corporate profits. --- BEGIN WITH PASSION FOR MOONSHINE We love moonshin’.

"0","2024-07-17","Gameplay On every level there are several objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a “contraption” which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. When the level starts “time is frozen”, gravity doesn’t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time, you can move things around, connect things, flip things, to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again. Gadgets Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, others by touching, pushing, or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected to function. For example, for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be attached to a rope, to a moving object, like a car. Objectives To rid the levels of the monsters! The simplest way is to push the monster off the edge of a platform and make it fall off the screen. You could cut the rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pull a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc. The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become. Key Features • Solve over 500 wacky puzzles form each game across 5 different worlds. • Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it. • Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing line pegs. • Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.","2024-07-02","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/1512/19c5f365fd72723ab95819531bd0bc1fa55187b60a7f9fb3.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4358-CUSA46428_00-CONTRAPTIONSCEUR","75%","0","Puzzle","99.8","null","null","Contraptions Collection","TRD","FUNBOX MEDIA LIMITED","2024-03-25","contraptions-collection-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","0","124.75","1","",

Your kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner. Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen. And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter. A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests. Forge your kingdom's destiny in Kingdoms and Castles, a captivating city-building adventure where your choices define your realm's prosperity and survival.","2024-07-02","/game/46505","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/0611/8428ac1bdf23df8111a843081c571ee57ecaf0ab3281f7b2.png?w=200","9","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0958-PPSA16909_00-KINGDOMSANDPS5EU","22%","16","Strategy, Simulator","295.62","null","null","Kingdoms and Castles","TRD","BLITWORKS SL","2024-03-21","kingdoms-and-castles-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","379.00","15","295.62","1","",

Unlock new parts, destroy more, witness entropy at its worst in digital-brutalist cityscapes. Build to destroy. GAMEPLAY BUILD Choose from parts with different weights, forms and functions to build a structure. Thruster + Connector + Bomb? You just built a rocket. Thruster + Rotator + Laser? You just built a rotating laser rocket. Pillar + Connector + Ultra Heavy Cube? That's a giant hammer. Be creative and resourceful with the parts you get, try to destroy the target with less parts or in a more elegant way – it's going to be a spectacle any way you do it. DESTROY Try to hit the main targets to win a level in campaign mode. Destroy an armored wall first so you can then shoot through the hole into the vulnerable center. Try to hit a bomb in the environment. Use environment mechanics like the giant Pistons to catapult Ultra Heavy Cubes into a target. Or just throw everything you have at your targets – that might just work too."" FEATURES COMPLEX DESTRUCTION SYSTEM Simulated statics, thousands of little particles of debris, whole chunks of targets flying into the abyss – with little to no framerate spikes. CAMPAIGN Seven worlds with several stages including bonus levels each, every stage a hand-crafted destructible cityscape. You will start each stage with a limited set of parts and you will need to find a strategy on how to use them to destroy all main target blocks. You will unlock new parts the further you progress, and every world comes with it's own special environmental mechanic. You can always return to a stage to try to destroy a higher percentage of it, or do it in less moves. SANDBOX Try out new patterns of building stuff. Play around with parts you haven't unlocked yet. Try to fry your GPU with 1000 Lasers at once. NEW: ENDLESS MODE Play the new Endless game mode and try to reach the ultimate highscore. PHOTO MODE take a free camera flying to get the best composition. Freeze or slow down time to get the perfect shot of the destruction you just caused.

Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable. It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive… A destination with plenty of surprises Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters.

However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive. Home sweet home Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. The more the merrier… You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable. Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.

"0","2024-07-17","Jesus did not die on the cross, but came down and unleashed vengeance on all the nonbelievers. 1500 years later, an army of Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith. In this dark fantasy adventure you solve intricate cases and unveil abysmal secrets as Inquisitor Mordimer Madderdin. The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation.

Poisonous meteor explosions, that's what! And that's just one of the many nefarious ways that you can combine elemental interactions. You can afflict villagers with flaws. Sure, you could just destroy the world with ice and fire, but the real fun begins when you meddle with villager lives to put them into compelling and tragic situations! Afflict an annoying husband with Unfaithfulness and then watch the fireworks once you tell his wife of his misdeeds. You can spawn monsters to kidnap and harass villagers.

A key feature of Listeria Wars is the parallel viewing experience. In addition to the main game process, you can view the life of the human whose body has become the pathogenic battlefield. The action in Listeria Wars takes place within the hero's body. You can see everything that happens to the host’s body in real-time. You manage various types of immune system cells, to protect the body and fend off attacks, from deadly contagions. The body’s immune system develops antibodies, as the action takes place. The game illustrates a person’s ability to be his own worst enemy: by neglecting personal hygiene, or ingesting rotten food, or failing to follow “social distancing”. You can also view the body’s use of involuntary immune system responses, such as vomiting and diarrhea. The goal is to protect and defend the infected body, from the deadly pathogens. Key features: FUNNY ADVENTURES OF THE HERO: Watch the effects of malicious pathogens and influence the immune system’s response. CONVENIENT MANAGEMENT: Leukocytes attack intuitively, depending on the situation. Gamers can place these cells strategically and monitor the overall course of defense. PATHOGEN DIVERSITY: Realistic infections, microbes, viruses, bacteria, and other harmful pathogens. TACTICS: Manage unique leukocytes using their tactical advantages against the various pathogens, infecting the host.

Do you want to focus on sheer destruction or are you into a more subtle puppetmaster approach? Slowly gain new powers by upgrading the Portal. Continue to sinisterly interact with the world to produce Chaotic Energy. You gain permanent access to more heinous Powers by upgrading the Portal. Depending on map size - from small to extra large - one playthrough may be longer or shorter. But more villagers means more ways to combine your demonic skills!

Upgrade your plague with various nasty symptoms and improve its virulence. You can even make Plagued victims explode when they die! You can torture people.

Perhaps someone will have mental anguish and become a Serial Killer when it gets back to its village? You can brainwash folks into becoming cultists. You can also try to brainwash your prisoners. If successful, it will return to its village as a secret cultist who will quietly worship and aid you. You can start a zombie apocalypse. You can also make the Plagued dead rise as zombies. Other villagers that they attack may also contract the virus. Soon, the entire village will be filled with nothing but shambling zombies. You can make Vampires and Werewolves.

You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it! FEATURES ARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically of off surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail. Advanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall. ARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island and Scorched Earth are released now, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis. The definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond. Thorough Quality of Life revamps in every area: redesigned User Interfaces, dynamic navigation for intelligent creature pathfinding, Wild Babies, Photo Mode, new Camera systems, new Map system, Tracking System, new Structures and Items, new Creatures, and much more. Cross-Platform Modding: Download & play new custom content created by players, including new maps, creatures, items, and game modes, through a dedicated new Mod-bowser directly within the game! Enjoy an endless stream of new ARK content as the creativity and talent of the community is fully unleashed for the first time ever across gaming platforms!

"","2024-07-17","A story from the legends, but in real history Winter War: over 500,000 Soviet soldiers attack Finland, a country with a population of 3,700,000, and the Finns drive them back, inflicting 5 times their own casualties. Continuation War: the Reds return with a total strength of 1,500,000 - almost half of the entire Finnish population - and the Finns stop them again. Finland’s survival in these two brutal wars against an enemy so vast was a true historical miracle. A miracle of heroism and valor. A miracle of the Finnish spirit of liberty. Experience heroic struggle and make tough choices You are the commander of the scarce Finnish troops. Your only goal - to save your homeland and your people from total annihilation. Would you risk losing your experienced troops to try and capture the enemy tanks? Would you try to save the stragglers during the retreat and risk losing everyone, or cut your losses and establish a new line of defense? Would you agree to negotiate with the Soviets that had treacherously attacked you twice before? Play two campaigns: historical and “what if” Historical campaign: Play through a number of missions throughout the 1939-1945 timeline, spanning three wars: Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War. The historical campaign will have smaller-scale but action-packed operations, covering all of the iconic historical battles. Complete numerous objectives grounded in history and narrated by a number of historical characters. Alternate history campaign: Play a shorter campaign with larger operations, centered around the “what if” events. Help the Germans take Leningrad, cut off the allied aid shipments to USSR by taking the port of Murmansk - that is only the beginning. Features: Immerse yourself into the history-driven gameplay: Thanks to cinematics before and after each operation you’ll watch history unfold through the eyes of the key historical figures of the time. Create and grow the army of your own design: Use a number of historical vehicles - all of which are available at historically accurate points in time. Train your troops and choose equipment: Choose various skills for your men as they gain combat experience. Combine units from different classes and acquire diverse equipment for them! Use historical heroes: Every unit could meet certain high requirements to generate a hero with a unique set of powerful skills. For Example the deadliest sniper in WW2 history - Simo HÃ¤yhÃ¤ Manage your Headquarters between the operations: More firepower or better intel - choose in which direction your HQ staff will improve. Use elaborate combat mechanics to overcome any foe: Lethal vs Nonlethal damage or using terrain differences to your advantage - those are just a few of the combat mechanics in-game. Utilize advanced supply and infrastructure systems: All units have limited ammo and fuel that are necessary to operate. You can use this and cut enemy supplies!","2024-07-02","/game/105469","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/0412/7be3130e648346b605f98c4c8947b69725d22aa371a8500d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA16443_00-0902122838417649","35%","0","Strategy, Strategy","999999","null","null","Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty","TRD","Klabater","2023-10-26","strategic-mind-spirit-of-liberty-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","749.00","0","486.85","1","",

Your adventure begins on a distant island, deep in a tropical Archipelago. What was once a prosperous tourist destination is now a shade of its former glory: and it’s your job to bring it back to life! Explore the Archipelago, meet the locals, and lend them a hand to restore the tourist paradise… while you try to uncover the mysteries of your past! SETTLING IN A NEW PLACE Your tropical life will be a busy one, so grab your tools and let’s get started! First things first: you’ll need a source of food, a place to spend the night in, and some resources to build a farm and kickstart your tropical journey. So what are you waiting for — time to explore your lands! A PLETHORA OF ACTIVITIES There’s plenty to do in Spirit of the Island! No matter how you choose to spend your time, you will gain experience and improve your skills, unlock new recipes, and become more efficient at everything you do, which will make your new life easier. Spirit of the Island features 10 unique skills, such as farming, mining, foraging, social, and even fishing, which comes as its own special mini-game. Will you become a true master of all? YOUR JOURNEY TO A TOURIST PARADISE Make your island not only a welcoming home but also a booming tourist paradise, with fancy shops and landmarks. The more tourists you get, the better your economy will be, which is a crucial step to fund your journeys to the faraway Islands. But how do you please them all, and what do you sell in your stores? That’s where your skills will come in handy! Sell local produce; open museums to display the treasure and secrets you uncover on your adventures. We bet some of your visitors could even buy a couple of quality wooden planks, so do your best to improvise! THE BEST TRIP EVER Each tourist will have a chance to love your Island so much that they’ll decide to stay, adding to the Town’s population. This part is crucial since you can hire them to do various things for you, such as tending to your shops and helping you maintain the Island. So do your best to make their trip a fantastic one! THE POWER OF TWO One of the main features of Spirit of the Island is a 2-player cooperative mode, where you can do… everything together! You will have all single-player mode features available in online play with its own unique story. Grow crops, set up a store, and sell your produce to tourists, explore the vast Archipelago, and discover the secrets of the tropical paradise together with a friend! VAST TROPICAL ARCHIPELAGO Spirit of the Island features 14 explorable islands, each with its own fauna, secrets, and dangers. Information on who - or what - inhabits these islands has been lost to history, but you will find mysterious caves guarded by ancient creatures — are you brave enough to explore them and uncover the mysteries within? Doing so will net you neat rewards and help you proceed towards your final goal: revealing the secret of your past. THE LOCAL COMMUNITY The Archipelago is bustling with life! Meet more than 14 unique characters, each with its own distinct traits and quirks. And yes, there are romance options as well! Depending on your character, you’ll be able to romance and marry different NPCs and hold a grandiose wedding in the end! AN EVENTFUL LIFE One of the unique features of Spirit of the Island is events — a series of recurring occurrences happening through each in-game year (4 months). They will come in various forms: from birthdays and traditional Holidays to your own unique events. There’s always something fun happening in Town, so make sure to check your calendar often!","2024-07-02","/game/109925","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/1615/jfTgsNhsgDDUp0kpRg2yoevL.png?w=200","31","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1302-PPSA13934_00-0584770477306422","25%","0","Adventure, Simulation, Party","440.3","null","null","Spirit of the Island","TRD","Plug In Digital","2023-10-19","spirit-of-the-island-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","629.00","0","471.75","1","",

ENDLESSâ„¢ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESSâ„¢ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death.

Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers.

Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESSâ„¢ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon.

Welcome to Everhood, a bizarre realm located on the edges of space and time. Its inhabitants are a peculiar lot. These otherworldly entities spend their days wandering labyrinthine castles. Clubbing and board games are popular pastimes here, as well. That is, until a gnome steals an arm from Red, the wooden doll. A seemingly simple quest to reclaim it begins to pull at the fraying threads of this strange world, unraveling a mystery and reality in the process. Go on a trip through the doors of perception. Explore fantastical environments in the hunt for the pinched limb. Play hide and seek with animate mushrooms in the forest, win carnival prizes, and race go-karts against colorful characters like mages, sentient save points, robots, and vampires. Learn about Red's past and come ever-closer to finding the Absolute Truths of the Universe. But knowledge often comes at a cost. Some of Everhood's eclectic residents aren't content to let Red roam the realm freely. Face off against challengers ranging from multi-legged monsters to brothers who run a plank-selling business, and the fearsome Gold Pig, in musical battles. Avoid incoming attacks by moving, grooving, and leaping out of harm's way while jamming out to bespoke battle themes as varied as the inhabitants of this curious community. Red's journey is teeming with secrets and world-alerting revelations. As Everhood's true nature begins to appear, adventurers will make decisions that impact Red's role in the fate of everyone – and everything – the doll encounters.

"","2024-07-17","Weedcraft Inc explores the business of producing, breeding and selling weed in America, delving deep into the financial, political and cultural aspects of the country's complex relationship with this troublesome and promising plant. Would-be marijuana moguls will need to prioritize resources carefully as they manage the production and distribution of their weed. Cultivate killer plants, cross-breed them to create unique strains of the devil’s lettuce, hire and manage a growing staff, and be prepared to take on the competition. As in real life, the business of bud presents plenty of opportunity along with a plethora of problems. Decide when and where to take on extra risk to maximize profit, but be careful, the cops and politicians are all working their own angles. An important, controversial topic presented in an insightful and detailed manner, Weedcraft Inc presents a challenge to those who would rule the reefer, offering a series of diverse scenarios and unique characters to work with (or around) as your budding empire grows. Whether you choose to hobnob with politicians, pay off the police, fight for medical marijuana rights or work the legal system, it’s all in the name of the sticky icky and your cutthroat corporate profits. --- BEGIN WITH PASSION FOR MOONSHINE We love moonshin’. There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught!","2024-07-02","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0410/3b69a8fabd03f283a64ce0ac05d6ac9ac2cd3e11aedd4138.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA29034_00-0157935667191883","33%","0","Simulation, Strategy","544.98","null","null","Weedcraft Inc + Moonshine Inc Bundle","TRD","Klabater","2023-08-24","weedcraft-inc-+-moonshine-inc-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","879.00","0","588.93","1","",

"","2024-07-17","How many steps does it take to change a light bulb? If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for ""Contraptions"" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style. Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels. Features + Solve over 200 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds. + Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it. + Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs. + Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like. Gameplay On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a “contraption” which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. When the level starts “time is frozen”, gravity doesn’t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again. Gadgets Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car. Objectives There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc. The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","2024-07-02","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/1409/d420f69e4c70a643d3d47533dee33229f71a0db22c22613c.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4358-CUSA43722_00-CONTRAPTIONS3EUR","75%","0","Puzzle","35","null","null","Contraptions 3","TRD","FUNBOX MEDIA LIMITED","2023-07-20","contraptions-3-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","175.00","0","43.75","1","",

"","2024-07-17","BEGIN WITH PASSION FOR MOONSHINE We love moonshin’. There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner. You will progress through main missions, you’ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises... If you’ll be prospering, you’ll get the chance to create and manage bases in five different regions, each with its own, more and more challenging missions. From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there’ll be a pesky agent who’ll want to work with you, and there’ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You’re a free man, after all. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught! Features: [*]a faithful reflection of the moonshine craft - fermentation and distillation based on chemical formulas behaving as natural processes [*]a realistic recreation of an American moonshiner’s business, with all its challenges [*]a rich story - 3 possible successful endings or a “Game Over” if caught by the authorities [*]5 regions - running the base in the mountains, forest, swamps, town, and city, with linear progression [*]70+ recipes - 15+ moonshines, 15+ whiskies, 20 brandies, 20+ vodkas [*]50+ ingredients - sugars, fruits, vegetables, and grains [*]35+ apparatuses - 17 distillation stills, 8 fermentation tanks, 5 post-distillation tanks, 7 pre-fermentation apparatuses, and more [*]26 fermentation and distillation technologies [*]37 main quests + side quests and road events [*]Original Score - 19 tracks that embrace the vibe of illegal activities in American mountains. [*]Digital Artbook with concept art and information about creating visuals.","2024-07-02","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2612/38cfb0b38a1dbfdb3307754b9159074a376fab17647d6263.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA16662_00-0777700249352609","35%","0","Strategy, Simulator","377.4","null","null","Moonshine Inc.: Supporter Edition","TRD","Klabater","2023-06-27","moonshine-inc-supporter-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","629.00","0","408.85","1","",

"","2024-07-17","A bundle pack of The Rumble Fish 2 game and its three additional characters. Additional characters can be purchased separately, so please be wary of purchasing the same character multiple times. A legendary arcade game developed by Dimps in 2005. This fighting game gained popularity for its smooth visuals powered by S.M.A as well as the high level of strategy driven by its 2-gauges system. And with the addition of new current-gen features it's even easier to play. - Battle Mechanics Polished to a Shine by a Legendary Studio Known for Fighters: The first original fighting game from Dimps, known for being involved in a number of other fighting games. It has continued to attract fighting game fans since its release in 2005 with mechanics that use 2 gauges--one for offense and one for defense--and slick 2D visuals powered by S.M.A. (Smooth Model Animation). - New Features for Console Provide a Modern Gameplay Experience: The console version contains new features such as an Online Versus Mode--a first for the series. It uses Rollback Netcode, which corrects lag between players, making for a streamlined experience online. And with 16:9 wide-screen support, AI and a training mode, you can fully enjoy this game in the comfort of your own home. - Main Game Modes: ãƒ»Arcade ãƒ»Survival ãƒ»Time Attack ãƒ»Local Multiplay ãƒ»Online Multiplay with rollback netcode ãƒ»Training ãƒ»Gallery Added features: Spectator mode, rematch, match recording, combat range and match time settings, assist mode, new character colors, button assignment for Boost Dive, and an updated training mode including character-specific gauge and enemy attack/dodge/ground recovery settings, as well as adjustments to enemy auto recovery timing. - The Story: It is the end of the 20th century... A large-scale natural disaster struck the eastern area of a nation. It wiped out the financial sector and resulted in a staggering loss of life. At the dawn of the 21st century, the conglomerate PROBE-NEXUS, commonly known as Probe, began reconstruction efforts in that eastern area. Colossal capital and cutting-edge technology was poured into rebuilding it. Skyscrapers that put the old high-rises to shame along with the world's biggest shopping mall and recreational facilities. This was the dazzling birth of a symbol for the new century. It was christened Zone Prime. And now, in an undeveloped sector of its western block, there was an area known as the slums... - Additional Characters: ãƒ»Greed A survivor of the illegal fighting organization ""Valor"". He joined the tournament ""F.F.S."" again in order to fight against a yet-to-be-seen strong fighter. ãƒ»Hazama A new president of the PROBE-NEXUS, ostensibly to support the new chairman, Beatrice.

The Prince rolled the katamari and made the katamari bigger and bigger, rolling up all the things on the earth. The katamari that he created floated in space, sparkling, and brought back the lost starry sky. As the starry sky was restored, the King's fans gradually grew in number all over the world. The King wanted to respond to the wishes of his fans for his success, and the Prince kept rolling the katamari to make everyone's dreams come true. • We Love Katamari Damacy has been powered up! We Love Katamari Damacy, the second title in the Katamari series released in 2005, has been remastered. The graphics have been completely redesigned, and the in-game UI has been revamped to make it even easier to play. • New additional features such as Royal Reverie are also available! In his youth, the King received a strict education from his father, the Great King. New challenges have been added where you can roll around as the King in his boyhood! The days of hard study and intense training can all be rolled through in 5 all-new challenges. Will the young King be able to clear the tough challenges? In addition, a selfie mode has been added, allowing the Prince and his cousins to take quick photos while rolling through the stages! • A simple but very deep game! Roll the katamari, roll up objects, and make the katamari bigger. You can roll up anything from paper clips and snacks in the house, to telephone poles and buildings in the town, to even living creatures such as people and animals. Once the katamari is complete, it will turn into a star that colors the night sky. You cannot roll up anything larger than the current size of your katamari, so the key is to think in advance about the order in which you roll things up around the stage! * This product is based on the We Love Katamari Damacy software that was released in 2005 on another platform.

Basic puzzle mechanics stay throughout (only by stepping on the button can you open the door) but the flow of the puzzles doesn’t repeat. Like Braid and Portal before it, there’s a desire to always present the player with new challenges, and it works.

Tolkien or whether you are exploring The Lord of the Rings for the first time, the Precious Edition offers an even more immersive game experience. This edition includes: - The Lord of the Rings: Gollumâ„¢ base game. - The Sindarin VO DLC, which adds a touch of authenticity to dialogue with the Elves. - The Lore Compendium DLC, a treasure trove of information about the game's key characters, locations and events, taking you deep into the history of Middle-earth. - The Original Soundtrack application so you can listen to the game soundtrack whenever you want. - The Art Exhibition application that takes you behind the scenes of the game creation process with lots of sketches and development secrets. The Lord of the Rings: Gollumâ„¢ is an official adaptation based on the literary works of J.R.R Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose… How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring â„¢, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dÃ»r and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself… or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn't break; he bends, he adapts… Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It's up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","2024-07-02","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1516/cec5fbb61cd4453f65ef3a79fd63af8b8b7548cb22c91c4f.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG00DELUXE00001","80%","0","Adventure","349.8","null","null","The Lord of the Rings: Gollumâ„¢ - Precious Edition","TRD","NACON SA","2023-05-25","the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-precious-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","0","349.80","1","",

"","2024-07-17","How many steps does it take to change a light bulb? If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for ""Contraptions"" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style. Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels. Features + Solve over 200 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds. + Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it. + Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs. + Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like. Gameplay On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a “contraption” which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. When the level starts “time is frozen”, gravity doesn’t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again. Gadgets Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car. Objectives There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc. The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","2024-07-02","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1611/903ac3051a1c8b056dfb990b0e323721f39ab8674bbbc7c9.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4358-CUSA40925_00-CONTRAPTIONS2EUR","75%","0","Puzzle","35","null","null","Contraptions 2","TRD","FUNBOX MEDIA LIMITED","2023-04-05","contraptions-2-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","175.00","0","43.75","1","",

"","2024-07-17","THE APOCALYPSE HAPPENED... In a desperate move to end all wars that have been rampaging the world for decades, the mages provoked The Cataclysm. Massive balls of pure magic obliterated nearly everything. A strange purple mist propagated everywhere, with hordes of bloodthirsty mutants coming at night. Our only hope is now to banish all magic from this accursed world by casting The Last Spell, requiring several days of uninterrupted incantation whilst a few strained Heroes try to protect those damned mages. The Last Spell is a tactical RPG with roguelite elements in which you have to defend a city against hordes of deadly enemies. During daytime, prepare your Heroes, carefully choose how to rebuild your Haven and position your defenses. Over the night, exterminate all the monsters coming at your walls with a large range of weapons and skills. Then heal, level up, and repeat until the Magic Seal is broken. FEATURES Turn-Based Tactical RPG: â—� The whole RPG package: a flurry of stats, skills, perks, traits… and more. â—� Tons of items: armors, weapons, trinkets and potions… with their own stats and skills, as well as optional random modifiers. Each weapon has its own skillset and playstyle! â—� Build your own classes: upgrade your heroes with stat bonuses and perks, and equip whatever gear you wish. Want to make a glass cannon rogue/mage fighting with a gun? Do it! â—� Manage your squad of heroes: they’re strong, but they are few and have access to limited resources. Healing and mana are scarce, so try to find a good balance. Hordes of Evil: â—� Think and adapt: you will face swarms of deadly enemies with only a few hardened heroes. Optimize your positioning and plan your actions: big AOE attacks, crowd control, buffs, poison... Every Action Point counts towards another day of survival. â—� Enemies have strengths and weaknesses that will challenge your wits. And because hard is not enough for us, be prepared for the terrifying Elites! â—� Each map will end with epic fights against unique mind-bending bosses. Protect the Haven: â—� Rebuild the city to help you in-between fights. Get healed, forge new magical weapons, get new heroes. Spend your resources wisely, commander! â—� Build up your defenses: walls, traps, towers, catapults… every tiny bit of help is welcome. â—� Protect the Magic Circle at all costs! If you lose it, humanity is doomed. â—� 5 Havens to protect, each with their own setup and challenges requiring you to tailor your strategy to beat the Great Evil. Roguelite Elements: â—� The game is meant to be hard. You will fail… A lot. But every time you do, you’ll grow harder, better, faster, stronger! â—� Procedurally generated enemy waves, characters, weapons and a ton of unlockables will keep you entertained until the real world collapses. â—� Tailor each run thanks to the Omens: a limited amount of bonuses that can be picked for the upcoming run. Do you prefer more Action Points, more characters, sturdier defenses, better loot? Experiment to find your preferred tools of destruction. â—� Scale the difficulty to your liking, with 6 levels of Apocalypse to entertain even the most crazy hardcore players.","2024-07-02","/game/93160","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0613/103bc799353f562b710a34015ca09d895ed2f64556c8b194.png?w=200","34","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5539-PPSA09525_00-2899485575378333","35%","50","Role-Playing","377.4","null","null","The Last Spell","TRD","The Arcade Crew","2023-03-09","the-last-spell-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","629.00","42","408.85","1","",

[What is ONI : Road to be the Mightiest Oni?] â– Setting: Kisejima Island The story takes place on Kisejima, a small island in the middle of the ocean. Here, it is said that the power that lies dormant within the local demon spirits can be drawn out by challenging them to trials, where ancient demons who were once defeated by Momotaro are summoned to battle. However, few have ever returned from Kisejima alive. â– Characters: Kuuta, a demon warrior, and his spirit partner, Kazemaru Kuuta, the protagonist, is the only survivor of the Demon King's army that faced Momotaro in battle. He and Kazemaru, a mysterious spirit that lives on Kisejima, team up to take on challenges of all shapes and sizes! â– Artwork by KENEI DESIGN Kisejima may not be large, but the colorful artwork by KENEI DESIGN, with its dazzling green meadows, looming forests, and plains of floating megaliths, offers a unique emotional impact unlike any other action game. Its solo creator has invented a mini-world in which each and every location is marked by its own memorable appeal.

"","2024-07-17","Use your grappling hook to swing around in giant levels, dash through energy crystals, find hidden secrets and master even the most difficult worlds. Play in free style or against the timer with one or two grappling guns and finish more than 10 enormous levels by dodging obstacles and deadly traps. It’s easy to play, it’s fast and it’s fun. You start the game in the middle of a giant city surrounded by skyscrapers. You look around and see a giant poster that explains the general movement. This way you learn that you are able to dash while being in the air. You also realize that you have a grappling gun in your hand and see floating crystals above your head. You aim at the crystals and use your grappling gun to hook onto them. Once hooked you start swinging and swing towards the next crystal. You hook on to the next crystal and have already mastered the main movement mechanism. After a couple of hooks, you realize that you can change your swinging direction and speed by dashing into the wanted direction. This is the second important thing to learn about the movement and gives you a lot of freedom in your movement. Soon you will reach the next giant poster which explains further movement patterns that you can use to improve your precision and movements. You learn that you can remove your grappling hook, use an in-air dash and then hook on to the next floating crystal to build up speed and energy. You can use this energy to collect hidden achievements, dash through activator crystals, that unlock new areas o the level, or speed run levels later on. Furthermore, you realize that the dash refreshes every couple of seconds which leads to an incredibly fast and satisfying movement once you are able to master it.","2024-07-02","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0616/xTpaVApaeqWLeKILuhVo3DMo.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6556-CUSA36652_00-7394737770687028","45%","0","Action, Casual, Family","124.5","null","null","Grappling Dash","TRD","EpiXR Games UG","2022-12-20","grappling-dash-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","249.00","0","136.95","1","",

Defend your city as five unique and devastating Kaiju grow in power with every attack. Unfortunately, they can't be killed, but can be slowed down and forced to fall back... for now. Monsters move towards the nearest building, and the scientists have mathed the exact odds of where they might go next. Build sacrificial army bases and airfields to distract the Kaiju. If standard methods aren't enough, deploy experimental weapons such as freeze rays and transforming mechas to keep them at bay. Or you can always park tanks and jets in the monsters’ path to slow them down (don't worry, we have a good insurance policy). If all your efforts fail, don't be ashamed and run away! Be prepared to evacuate the laboratory using transport trucks, boats, or planes when the Kaiju get too close. Play missions from all over the world as you progress through the fight against Kaiju in a 15+ hour story-based campaign. Throughout the campaign, you’ll have the chance to gain an advantage with upgradeable ACE units and Project Deck customization. Test your wits in tactical puzzles, command dozens of units in large-scale scenarios, and fend off repeated attacks in defense missions while developing your city economically. And if you’re hungry for more, test your command skills in weekly challenges! Features: Protect your city in a tactical battle with cannon-fodder tanks, jets, and more... unusual firepower. Face five different Kaiju - each with unique skills and potential for mutation. Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Do everything to stop the monsters, including sacrificing your units and buildings. Remember that you can’t kill Kaiju - you can only slow them down. Defend cities around the world in 15+ hours of campaign mode.

Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, in most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.","2024-07-02","/game/89898","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png?w=200","10","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-GASSTATIONSIM0EU","30%","27","Simulation","324.35","null","null","Gas Station Simulator","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2022-10-19","gas-station-simulator-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","14","349.30","1","",

"","2024-07-17","AUTHENTIC GAMEPLAY With the dual stick controls, each stick represents one of your feet. You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. ""IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN"" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels…) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones for your style and shred the most iconic spots!","2024-07-02","/game/70726","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/2412/267dcd99838eca943a1ab23184ecacde8a479ea56d9d37ad.png?w=200","5","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06510_00-SSSG000000000000","65%","49","Simulation, Sport","0","null","null","Session: Skate Sim","TRD","NACON SA","2022-09-22","session-skate-sim-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1249.00","27","437.15","1","",

Graphics are presented in pixelated two-tone style but offer a touch of detail, customization and precision that pushes beyond the limits of its inspirations.

"","2024-07-17","A unique first-person life simulation game of a lumberjack building up a business and founding his own dynasty. Lumberjack's Dynasty is a unique mix of forestry, logging and life simulation combined with role playing elements. You start at a run-down logger camp which you slowly take over from your aunt and uncle to bring it back to its former glory. Besides the pure “lumberjacking” you can solve a large variety of quests and train many skills to become better and more professional along the way. You can always and freely adapt your way of playing: Either quickly become a straightforward and professional lumberjack by purchasing, cutting and converting large forests into products – and, thereby – into your economic success without getting sidetracked too much. Alternatively, you can take more time to explore the full depth of the game and also let yourself experience the vast variety of additional possibilities - ranging from repairing and renovating your buildings and vehicles, over fishing, making honey, and growing vegetables to socializing with local folks, finding the love of your life and eventually founding your own family. Either way, a lot of fun (and hard work) is waiting for you while taking care of your life while growing your company and transforming both into a successful Lumberjack’s Dynasty. Features • Unique mix of forestry, logging and life simulation in first person view • Quest driven story line • Large, open world • Plenty of individual characters to interact with • Adaptable gameplay with huge variety of tasks • Skill system – learn and improve your skills to become better and more efficient • Economic system with different products and varying prices • Control heavy machinery and vehicles • Manufacture and sell logs, planks, bark and other wooden products • Repair, rebuild and expand your home and other buildings • Repair and work on specific vehicles • Take a rest from your lumberjacking and follow other activities such as fishing, growing vegetables, collecting fruit, making honey and cooking delicious meals • Earn social points and money as (partially interchangeable) currencies to further expand and develop your business • Find a wife and raise a family • Grow your Lumberjack’s Dynasty by making the right decisions","2024-07-02","/game/78100","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/0607/PNqIKutXZfpFBCc3mHQbOLKR.png?w=200","55","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3550-CUSA32418_00-LUMBERJACKSDYNEU","60%","160","Simulation, Role Playing Games","299.6","null","null","Lumberjack's Dynasty","TRD","Toplitz Productions","2022-06-30","lumberjacks-dynasty-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","749.00","100","299.60","1","",

The Shadowrun Trilogy comprises 3 cult tactical RPG games taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which magic has re-awakened, bringing back to life creatures of high fantasy. Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades. Shadowrun Returns The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Nearly 10 years ago, creator Jordan Weisman returned to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return… Shadowrun Hong Kong - Extended Edition HONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world’s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. As an ex-con living in Seattle, you try to make an honest living but when your foster begs you to meet him in China, things turn grim and you find out the police are trying to arrest you. And by arrest, they mean to kill you on sight! Build your team of Shadowrunners, mercenaries with big personalities who can fight using mystical or technical powers, and turn the tables on the elite corporate and the police.

France, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken.

"","2024-07-17","Play as 3 vampires, wield their powers wisely, and strike the right balance between your human and animal side in a heart-pounding story in which your choices will decide the fate of Boston. Based on the cult role-playing game and developed by specialists in the genre, Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong is a narrative RPG in which your every choice determines the fate of the three main characters and of the Boston Camarilla. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF DARKNESS What if vampires were real? What if these bloodthirsty predators lived hidden among us in complex societies and had been hatching conspiracies for thousands of years? And what if you became one of them? In Vampire: The Masquerade, you play as these alluring monsters in a sophisticated world where the lines between the real and supernatural are always blurred. A HEART-POUNDING THRILLER Hazel Iversen, the Swan, is the new Prince of the Boston Camarilla. An iron hand in a velvet glove, she intends to assert her power and respect the Masquerade, the vampiric law designed to ensure humans never learn of the existence of these creatures of the night. But nothing works as planned. With rumours of plots, murders and power struggles, you must work in the shadows to protect your Sect in a pulsating investigation that plunges Boston into chaos. PLAY AS 3 ORIGINAL VAMPIRES Play as 3 vampires who are over a hundred years old. Progress in the game through their intertwined destinies, deal with their different points of view and use their character sheets to try to separate the truth from the lies. Each character has their own vampiric abilities and disciplines that you can upgrade individually to suit your preferred approach. Will you choose intimidation, seduction or stealth? It's your decision, as long as you can sate your Hunger for blood. GAMEPLAY WITH CONSEQUENCES With its unique gameplay, Swansong puts emphasis on the consequences of your actions in both the investigation and your social interactions with other characters. Analyse each situation carefully because your decisions can have huge consequences on your heroes' lives and the fate of the Boston Camarilla.","2024-07-02","/game/80719","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png?w=200","14","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-CUSA33241_00-VTMS000000000000","80%","27","Role-Playing","0","null","null","Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong","TRD","NACON SA","2022-05-19","vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1499.00","20","299.80","1","",

"","2024-07-17","Explore a vast, mysterious landscape on a spiritual journey. Immerse yourself in the visual artwork of internationally acclaimed media artist Bill Viola and the interactive designs of the award winning team at the USC Game Innovation Lab. Discover the secrets of this seminal experimental art game, re-mastered with new Bill Viola footage for PlayStationÂ®4. The Night Journey (2007-2018) was one of the earliest experimental art games conceived. It uses both game and video techniques to tell the universal story of an individual’s journey towards enlightenment. The game design explores a challenging question: what is the game mechanic of enlightenment? How can we model such an intensely personal yet archetypal experience? The game has been exhibited in galleries worldwide and was awarded IndieCade’s “Most Sublime Experience” award. The project stands as a milestone in the search to expand the boundaries of what game experiences may communicate through their game mechanics and world design.","2024-07-02","/game/79539","https://image.api.playstation.com/gs2-sec/appkgo/prod/CUSA10944_00/2/i_00dc1f49e82122621af971755ba7fc3b79c40d4305110488021617fe023d99d8/i/icon0.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1273-CUSA30645_00-0197069147151818","50%","0","Adventure, Unique","112.05","null","null","The Night Journey","TRD","University of Southern California","2022-03-14","the-night-journey-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","249.00","3","124.50","1","",

Both fans of Record of Lodoss War and all-new players alike can fully enjoy this latest installment in the series. â– Story Deedlit awakens suddenly in a mysterious, unknown place. Where am I? Why am I here? With nobody around to respond, her questions are met with only silence. Seeking answers, Deed eventually sets off on foot, alone… â– Game Features Sword and Arrow Attacks: Use your sword for powerful melee attacks against enemies within range, or employ projectile attacks using your bow and arrows against those farther away. Swappable Equipment: Freely equip and utilize swords and arrows obtained along the way. The powerful weapons and tools you acquire can be used to your advantage throughout your journey. You can also sell off weapons you no longer need. Swappable Elemental Spirits: Alternate among a selection of useful elemental spirits to change Deedlit’s various attributes. While using Sylph, the wind spirit, wind-based attacks do less damage. When the flame spirit Salamander is in use, fire-based attacks do less damage.

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naivetÃ© of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","2024-07-02","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/oiWObCmIi2HWJ2AUnHfc7P7a.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCODELUXE000000","80%","0","Action, Adventure","224.85","null","null","Sherlock Holmes Chapter One Deluxe Edition","TRD","FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","2021-11-15","sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1499.00","0","299.80","1","",

In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals.

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

"","2024-07-17","The Brimstone Society has summoned Rayne for one last mission to lead a group of soldiers into a giant underground castle to do battle against none other than her own father, Kagan. When her escort proves ineffective against Kagan’s supernatural forces, it’s up to Rayne to run, jump, cut, and feed her way through gruesome foes, deadly traps, tricky platforming sections, and horrifying bosses. It’s Rayne’s last job — will she “clean house” or find herself six feet under? Original developer WayForward has upgraded its 2011 classic 2D hack ‘n slash platformer with high resolution visuals, modern features, and all-new voice acting performed by original BloodRayne cast members Laura Bailey (Rayne) and Troy Baker (Kagan). Bloodrayne Betrayal: Fresh Bites distills the best parts of the BloodRayne series into a bloody, twitchy, action-packed 2D hack ‘n slash adventure through fifteen challenging stages. Features • All-new A-List voice acting: Original BloodRayne cast members Laura Bailey and Troy Baker reprise their roles as Rayne and Kagan – alongside talented voice actors Todd Haberkorn and Patrick Seitz – to bring new life to the original written dialog. • Sharpened visuals, squashed bugs, and support for higher display resolutions (up to 4K) help make Fresh Bites the definitive Bloodrayne Betrayal experience. • New difficulty options: Play with a newly rebalanced difficulty tuned for a fun and engaging experience, or sink your teeth into the punishing original difficulty mode if you’re looking for a tough-as-nails challenge. • 120 FPS mode available on PlayStation 5.","2024-07-02","/game/97689","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/1621/xsp0e1WB5DajhCI0WYTYHvNg.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6260-PPSA03365_00-9663954018076774","30%","0","Fighting, Action","349.3","null","null","BloodRayne Betrayal: Fresh Bites","TRD","Ziggurat Interactive, Inc.","2021-09-09","bloodrayne-betrayal-fresh-bites-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","499.00","5","349.30","1","",

"","2024-07-17","Order of Battle: World War II is a turn-based strategy game with an impressive variety of scenarios and theatres of war. Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders – split between Generals, Pilots and Captains – is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow. FEATURES Classic turn based, hex based gameplay with an intuitive UI and great depth. Play in dynamic campaigns with unit carryover and multiple ""what-if"" scenarios. A rich 3D world with detailed animations and effects 20 different Specializations give a unique feel to each faction including Banzai Charge, Bushido Code and even the Manhattan Project. Over a thousand different unit types, including infantry, tanks, ships and aircraft, each with unique visuals and animations Attach unique commanders to your units to give them additional offensive and defensive bonuses A deep but intuitive supply system allowing breakthroughs & encirclements.","2024-07-02","/game/63464","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1812/6vfDdBCOEsxM7cwPshdYlmYB.png?w=200","39","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4136-CUSA14680_00-OOBWWII000000001","70%","0","Strategy","149.7","null","null","Order of Battle: World War II","TRD","Slitherine","2021-08-19","order-of-battle-world-war-ii-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","0","149.70","1","",

Feel object resistance, surface texture, damage feedback, heartbeat simulation and more thanks to the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. SYSTEM REDUX Veteran Observers can dive deeper into this dystopian reality thanks to three brand-new side cases to solve. “Errant Signal”, “Her Fearful Symmetry” and “It Runs in the Family” add another layer of depth to the game’s story while exploring thought-provoking themes of a future that soon might become our present. On top of that, System Redux offers expanded gameplay, which includes new game mechanics, new secrets to find, redesigned stealth, additional neural interrogations, and quality-of-life improvements made with the help of the Observer community.

WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects’ minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion.

Like older 8-bit games, it’s a game that’s meant to be replayed over and over again until mastered. Quick reactions and timing are necessary for success in the game. Levels – which are in the form of rooms – are short and require you to quickly scan to find a way to get to the next room, which is either a doorway that requires a key found within that room or a black hole Visually and from an auditory standpoint, everything about the game is designed to look and feel like an old school 8-bit game.

An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers. Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these ""flying soldiers"" can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these ""characters"", they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance. Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help. It's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.","2024-07-02","/game/82333","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0306/XAwIPNpQTUn2Orp1uzkGd0WY.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3877-CUSA20588_00-FLYINGBASEGAME00","89%","0","Family, Puzzle, Unique","41.69","null","null","Flying Soldiers","TRD","Wild Sphere S.L.","2020-09-17","flying-soldiers-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","379.00","0","41.69","1","",

Choose from lots of possible approaches to prepare the best plan. Many modern devices available in Thief Simulator might come in handy with gathering intel about your target and it's neighbourhood. The faster, the better. Find and steal as many valuables as possible in the shortest time possible. Remember that infinite backpacks don't exist. When it's about time you have to maintain cold blood. In every house you'll find tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you're not sure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police attention to you! A real, experienced thief can spot places where there's most probability of finding some valuables on the fly. Use the flashlight at night to highlight all the valuables in sight and places where you can expect them to be. Disassemble a stolen car and sell parts on the internet. Prepare phones and tablets before selling them in a pawn shop by removing their security. Be careful! In some houses you can meet unexpected guests. If they catch you in the act, they will call the police. In this case hide and wait till they stop looking for you or you can always leave the loot and run away as fast as possible.","2024-07-02","/game/62315","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1020/Y5HDMnLTw6ZqzZ0pJacQ8GlG.png?w=200","13","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1549-CUSA20097_00-CLABS0TS20200430","85%","27","Action, Simulator","74.85","null","null","Thief Simulator","TRD","PlayWay plc","2020-08-12","thief-simulator-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","17","74.85","1","",

This bundle contains SUPERHOT - the award-winning first-person shooter in which time moves only when you move, SUPERHOT VR - the absolute must-play staple of virtual reality, and SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE – the followup non-VR title painstakingly created over three years of grueling production to satisfy your intense need for more SUPERHOT. Getting all games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT’s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem. Immerse yourself in the brutalist, concrete world of SUPERHOT. Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world. You can be truly free. SUPERHOT Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets. SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT’s signature power fantasy. You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they’re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched. Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel. You take a moment to consider. You’ve been here before. So many times. Maybe this time it will actually mean something. SUPERHOT VR Decisive winner of dozens of VR Game of the Year awards, SUPERHOT VR is a title reimagined and redesigned from the ground up for VR and hand tracking controllers. The fruit of over three years of close cooperation between the critically acclaimed SUPERHOT Team and Oculus, SUPERHOT VR brings the intensely visceral action of SUPERHOT directly into your head and soul. And now – directly into your VR headset too. The game will test your limits. It will bring pain – of the good kind. In the end you will prevail. You will be one with the system.","2024-07-02","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2477-CUSA18510_00-7827683902308671","60%","0","Action","499.6","null","null","THE COMPLETE SUPERHOT BUNDLE","TRD","Superhot","2020-07-16","the-complete-superhot-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1249.00","0","499.60","1","",

"","2024-07-17","Forget everything you know about first-person shooters: Void Bastards asks you to take charge, not just point your gun and fire. Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage... Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don’t worry though, as any crafting progress you’ve made is retained from one to another.","2024-07-02","/game/67475","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202004/0922/c2PFv5RzqHZ4L87K6BuGxnQW.png?w=200","8","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3717-CUSA16300_00-VOIDBASTARDSGMEU","70%","28","Arcade, Strategy","224.7","null","null","Void Bastards","TRD","Humble Games","2020-05-07","void-bastards-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","749.00","13","224.70","1","",

REAL BOUT FATAL FURY is the only Fatal Fury title with bounds, and characters who are pushed out of bounds lose the round in a comical way, which can lead to unexpected comebacks.There are 16 playable characters in the game. This title also concludes the story that started in the original FATAL FURY. In REAL BOUT FATAL FURY SPECIAL the series drops the 3rd line introduced in FATAL FURY 3. Krauser, Tung Fu Rue, Cheng Sinzan and Laurence Blood also make their return in this game. Geese also makes an unexpected return as Nightmare Geese. In REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2 the system has been changed up a bit so that the 2nd line is mostly used for evasion and throwing your opponent. Three new characters are also included in this title: Li Xiangfei, Rick Strowd, and Alfred. The first two are new playable characters, while Alred is a secret boss.
