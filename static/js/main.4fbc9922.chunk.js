You have to put an end to history books, planned obsolescence, kitschy dresses, never-ending sagas of boring video games and pea soup.

When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship\'s cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn\'t a walk in the park.

Thankfully, I escaped and learned to use my transformation as a kind of superpower.

The first player to create a straight line of three of his or her symbols... wins! CHECKERS (also known as Draughts) Players move their pieces diagonally from one square to another square. When a player jumps over their opponent\'s piece, you take that piece from the board. The first player to lose all of his or her pieces loses the game. MEMORY GAME The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board covered with cards faced down with minimum number of moves. Each separate move is to turn over any two cards. If they match you take them from board, if not you turn them back over. MINES The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden \\"mines\\" without detonating any of them.

At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout. It\'s a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. When the game\'s main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life. Playable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede.

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn\'t required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from.

The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles. Leveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area. Players are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far. The type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animus-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"4.5","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"65%","Completionist":"0","genre":"Action,Role-Playing,Arcade,Fighting","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"4.54","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"45.50","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"ANIMUS","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"TROOOZE","ReleaseDate":"2019-01-03","Slug":"animus-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"13.29","ChilePrice":"","Price":"7.99","MexicoPrice":"52.15","MainExtra":"5","SalePrice":"2.79"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.84","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-12","LowestPrice":"2.79","SaleStarted":"2022-04-21","description":"These are the days before Ire: Blood Memory, the days when Kerr the Breaker\u2019s evil slipped its way into Cadmeia.

This romance adventure game is set in Akihabara, where you\'ll enjoy your new, slightly naughty roommate life with laughter, tears, and the friendship of two female ninja. A young man is dazing off while working the night shift at a convenience store, when a girl stops in to ask for a meat bun. The one next to her appears to be her boyfriend, and after doing their shopping, the two of them link arms affectionately and take off. Just when the young man is thinking how nice it would be to have a girlfriend, a pair of girls in ninja cosplay show up. The girls just stare at the shop goods without buying anything in particular. Even worse, they\'re even chatting about ninja techniques or something along those lines. When he calls out to them to prevent theft, it becomes apparent that they have no money. Despite suspecting that they might try to steal something, he gives in and buys a bento for the two desperately pleading girls. The life of that young man is turned upside down from the moment of his encounter with the two young women. Illustration:AkasaAi Scenario:Linkedbrain Inc.

Big Drunk Satanic Massacre is basically a shooter with strong RPG elements - not that rocket propelled gun, though. The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food caf\xe9, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging. The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects. Ever wondered what it\'s like to be Satan\'s son? Nothing special... Unleashed lust, chronic alcoholism and reckless shooting - the usual routine Save Hell! Wait... What? Yup, that\'s right - Hell! It\'s not the place it used to be - Hell\'s been possessed. Possessed by the most vile dark hideous evil the world has known - people.

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality. In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes.

In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming 8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he takes on hordes of zombies let loose upon the world.<br /><br />Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne.  Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.<br /><br />Protect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic\'s epic story.<br /><br />The Escapists. \xa9 2015.

In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect.<br /><br />In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character\'s special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online!<br /><br />Featuring<br /><br />Up to 4 players: Play locally AND online with up to 4 players.<br /><br />Easy to pick up, hard to master gameplay: Start off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts.<br /><br />Tons of unlockable extras and secrets: Unlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure.<br /><br />Play on your own: Step up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City.<br /><br />Modes and options:Pick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley...<br /><br />Wicked Tracks: A Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Reptile Games V.O.F.","ReleaseDate":"2019-07-12","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307ELlaYoNnN2QdMDYZi72KXbx4CIwyMygCWFO04DsKQecY8C-QCukNoIAiVTJQr_YTgbIDbONcVucomRUQey8kRgm18kP.png?w=200","Slug":"lethal-league-blaze-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2557-CUSA13507_00-LLBLAZE000000000","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGj8lPwOeKg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"30%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Action,Sports","SalePrice":13.99,"PlusPrice":11.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"89","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/12579/danganronpa-v3-killing-harmony-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-05-12 06:59:00","Title":"Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-04-27 08:12:40","description":"Welcome to a new world of Danganronpa, and prepare yourself for the biggest, most exhilarating episode yet.

You\'ll struggle, but you\'ll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts \'n Goblins.<br /><br />In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!<br /><br />In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur\'s inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!<br /><br />Make full use of Arthur\'s weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely.
