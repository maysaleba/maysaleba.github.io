Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest. \u2022 Bold New Beginning \u2014 His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive\u2026And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series\u2014satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative\u2014and fuses them anew. \u2022 A Second Chance \u2014 Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. \u2022 A Darker, More Elemental World \u2014 From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War\u2019s breathtakingly threatening landscape\u2014by far the largest in the franchise. \u2022 Vicious, Physical Combat \u2014 With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-13","LowestPrice":"/game/3974","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1021/X3WIAh63yKhRRiMohLoJMeQu.png?w=200","MainStory":9,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP9000-CUSA07413_00-00000000GODOFWAR","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLr5BeiTha4","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":12,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1021/X3WIAh63yKhRRiMohLoJMeQu.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/god-of-war","Title":"God of War (English, Korean, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2018-04-19","Slug":"god-of-war-english-korean-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":28.9,"MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":11.56,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"93","SaleEnds":"2022-11-28","description":"RPG fans rejoice!

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-13","LowestPrice":"/game/68258","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","MainStory":16,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP1003-PPSA02532_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":34,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/deathloop","Title":"DEATHLOOP (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-13","Slug":"deathloop-simplified-chinese-english-korean-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":84.9,"MainExtra":23,"SalePrice":28.01,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"88","SaleEnds":"2022-11-28","description":"Reprise your role as a supernatural assassin in Dishonored 2 \u2013 the next chapter in the award-winning Dishonored saga by Arkane Studios.

Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You\u2019ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\u2019ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows? Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\u2019ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You\u2019ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it. Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you'll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-13","LowestPrice":"/game/51108","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1322/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png?w=200","MainStory":8,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/UP3376-PPSA04697_00-4288127721514045","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-AJjWF58AY","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":15,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":33.53,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1322/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/visage","Title":"VISAGE (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"SadSquare Studio Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-10","Slug":"visage-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":47.9,"MainExtra":11,"SalePrice":33.53,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"80","SaleEnds":"2022-11-28","description":"Buy Lost in Random™ once and get both the PS4™ and the PS5™ version.

Hotshot Racing is a blisteringly fast arcade-style racing game fusing drift handling, razor-sharp retro visuals and an incredible sense of speed to create an exhilarating driving experience. Developed by racing game veterans SUMO Nottingham and Lucky Mountain Games, Hotshot Racing is an all-new driving experience which revives the classic arcade gameplay of the 90s and thrusts it into the modern era. 16 racing circuits provide the twists, turns and straights conducive to searingly quick racing.

Solve puzzles and face sinister enemies in deadly combat in this relentless nightmare as Caroline Walker hunts for missing twin girls in a cavernous abandoned mansion. Can you confront your fears and uncover the secrets of Winterlake... or will you die trying? Something Evil Lurks at Winterlake While investigating the disappearance of twin girls at Winterlake, something terrible happens to Caroline Walker. Waking in the dead of night, naked and hooked up to some kind of outdated medical equipment in a bathtub, Caroline must fight for her life as she explores the halls of the abandoned mansion. A Return to Classic Survival Horror Tormented Souls draws inspiration from classic survival horror like From Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Alone in the Dark. A modern take on the fixed-perspective action-adventure game, it offers a modernised control scheme and dynamic camera combined with classic gameplay. Deadly Combat Dark forces and unspeakable horrors will do everything in their power to stop Caroline getting to the truth. Use anything and everything that you can find to fight back against evils lurking in the darkness. Keep Your Wits About You You'll need much more than a steady aim and sharp reflexes to make it out alive. Search the environment for anything you can use to your advantage. Combine items to solve twisted puzzles and use every resource available to explore the secrets of the mansion and its grounds. Fiendish Puzzles Scavenge essential resources and tools, decipher clues from long-forgotten journals, and combine it all to solve fiendish puzzles and get to the bottom of the mansion's sordid history. Gateways to Another Dimension Nothing is quite as it seems at Winterlake. Mirrors provide a path to an alternate reality and another place in time. By crossing these shimmering gateways, Caroline can manipulate the very fabric of reality in surprising ways. You Are Not Alone in the Dark The mansion may seem abandoned, but as Caroline investigates its secrets, dark forces and unspeakable horrors will do everything in their power to stop her getting to the truth. Be sure to be alert at all times, and use anything you can find to fight off the encroaching terrors of Winterlake. Just remember: gaze into the darkness, and it also gazes into you... Can Caroline Walker escape with the truth and escape with her life?","SaleStarted":"2022-11-13","LowestPrice":"/game/89133","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/8Cw9tryQWwC0R8Fc4ReBZLc8.png?w=200","MainStory":8,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/JP5905-PPSA02865_00-0000000000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW2cX5Kxbwc","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":13,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":22.32,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/8Cw9tryQWwC0R8Fc4ReBZLc8.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/tormented-souls","Title":"Tormented Souls (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Phoenixx Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-21","Slug":"tormented-souls-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":27.9,"MainExtra":10,"SalePrice":22.32,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"72","SaleEnds":"2022-11-28","description":"Combine Aegis's strength and speed with your skill to fight robot armies and change the course of history! \u2022 A unique and mysterious heroine As Paris burns and bleeds during the Revolution, you are Aegis, an automaton masterpiece made by Vaucanson, an engineer in the service of the Clockwork King.

The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","SaleStarted":"2022-11-13","LowestPrice":"/game/87808","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/UP0102-CUSA24159_00-MAKAIRE000000001","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F177-VTSGSM","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":22,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":19.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection","Title":"Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection (Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Capcom U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-31","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-simplified-chinese-english-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":39,"MainExtra":6,"SalePrice":19.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2022-11-28","description":"When humans get too lonely, they turn into monsters\u2026 Set sail across a beautiful and evolving world of darkness and light, and discover what it means to be human.

There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. \"IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN\" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen\u2026 In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels\u2026) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones for your style and shred the most iconic spots!","SaleStarted":"2022-11-13","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/1614/HoGo8LFf6bXTlxR5eU1Kcu5v.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/EP6665-PPSA06510_00-1798662863472577","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Simulation, Sport","PlusPrice":51.93,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/1614/HoGo8LFf6bXTlxR5eU1Kcu5v.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Session: Skate Sim - Deluxe Edition (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-22","Slug":"session-skate-sim--deluxe-edition-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":79.9,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":55.93,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-28","description":"For the first time in a railway simulator, you are the driver and the company manager!

Digital Deluxe Edition are also available. [Game Description] The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki is a completely new game in the Kiseki series. The sprawling Republic of Calvard is experiencing an unprecedented economic boom brought on by post-war reparations. At the same time, feelings of uncertainty stemming from a massive influx of immigrants and bold political reform by the new president are rife. Deep within its capital city, a young Spriggan man receives a strange request that threatens to plunge the entire nation into chaos\u2026 [Prologue] The Spriggan is a type of undeground agent, born in the melting pot of diversity that is the Republic of Calvard. Spriggans take on any and all requests, acting as detectives, negotiators, or even as bounty hunters. They subcontract requests that the police can't handle, consult with citizens on matters that can't be brought to light, and even take on legitimate requests from criminals and underground forces. This earned them the apt nickname \"jack-of-all-trades\". In the year 1208, a well-to-do student dressed in the uniform of a prestigious school visits an old building located deep within the Republic's capital. The girl stares at the plaque, upon which Arkride Solutions Office is emblazoned in plain letters. She clears her throat and then knocks three times. \"How odd, we don't receive many callers before noon...\" The calm voice of a surprisingly young, though mature-sounding man is heard from within, and the doorknob slowly starts to turn. And thus, our story begins.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-13","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/0701/JzqHW2LFXhOsY7m80dTcgJSj.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP5846-PPSA07728_00-EDKURONOKISEKI01","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":999999,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/0701/JzqHW2LFXhOsY7m80dTcgJSj.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki (Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"CLOUDED LEOPARD ENTERTAINMENT INC.","ReleaseDate":"2022-07-27","Slug":"the-legend-of-heroes-kuro-no-kiseki-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":67.9,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":47.53,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-28","description":"A set of The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki DLC that includes additional costumes and attachment items.

Assume the leadership of a medieval noble family, increasing its power and reputation through the generations. As one ruler dies, they are replaced by an heir who may have very different abilities or interests, forcing you to adjust your long term plans. Play a master of the battlefield, conquering your enemies, or play a subtle seeker of secrets, using plots and poison to advance your agenda - all in the same game. Arrange marriages, champion the faith and establish new empires in this modern classic - unlike any other strategy game you\u2019ve ever played on console. HISTORY Choose a royal or noble house from a number of realms on a map that stretches from Iceland to India, from the Arctic Circle to Central Africa. Guide a dynasty through the centuries, ensuring the security and power of each new generation. Gather new lands and titles to cement your legacy. Be a pious king to bring the religious powers to your side, or strike out on your own, designing your own splinter religion and earning everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Knights, peasant revolts, pilgrimages, Viking raiders... experience the drama and pageantry of the Middle Ages! CHARACTER Adopt one of five different lifestyles, perfecting your skills in military strategy or kingdom management. Acquire character traits that will guide your actions, but beware if you act against your nature! The stress from denying your truest self could bring a new host of troubles! Choose appropriate guardians for your heirs, or train them yourself. But what do you do if the legal heir is not quite up to the job? Violent characters may develop a fearsome reputation, cowering your timid subjects into obedience with the dread you inspire. WARFARE Recruit men-at-arms units and powerful knights to supplement your royal levies. Research new technologies to increase the wealth and military might of your realm. Hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major wars. Supplement your income with ransomed prisoners or raiding parties on neighboring realms. INTRIGUE Use your spymaster to discover plots against your dynasty and your rule. Recruit agents to assist your schemes to undermine or murder anyone who stands between you and power. Seduce other characters for love or political power. Gather information for blackmailing purposes or call in favors whenever your plans need an extra bit of influence.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-13","LowestPrice":"/game/71763","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/1607/czGau6hOvx9iQYOOkACdxqDl.png?w=200","MainStory":70,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/EP4139-PPSA02308_00-TTL0000000000002","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8N_6xtr0Q","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":715,"genre":"Strategy, Simulation","PlusPrice":999999,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/1607/czGau6hOvx9iQYOOkACdxqDl.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Crusader Kings III (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"H2 INTERACTIVE CO., LTD.","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-29","Slug":"crusader-kings-iii-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":67.9,"MainExtra":185,"SalePrice":47.53,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-28","description":"Have you played Crusader Kings III but want more?

The sprawling Republic of Calvard is experiencing an unprecedented economic boom brought on by post-war reparations. At the same time, feelings of uncertainty stemming from a massive influx of immigrants and bold political reform by the new president are rife. Deep within its capital city, a young Spriggan man receives a strange request that threatens to plunge the entire nation into chaos\u2026 [Prologue] The Spriggan is a type of undeground agent, born in the melting pot of diversity that is the Republic of Calvard. Spriggans take on any and all requests, acting as detectives, negotiators, or even as bounty hunters. They subcontract requests that the police can't handle, consult with citizens on matters that can't be brought to light, and even take on legitimate requests from criminals and underground forces. This earned them the apt nickname \"jack-of-all-trades\". In the year 1208, a well-to-do student dressed in the uniform of a prestigious school visits an old building located deep within the Republic's capital. The girl stares at the plaque, upon which Arkride Solutions Office is emblazoned in plain letters. She clears her throat and then knocks three times. \"How odd, we don't receive many callers before noon...\" The calm voice of a surprisingly young, though mature-sounding man is heard from within, and the doorknob slowly starts to turn. And thus, our story begins.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-13","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/1408/ytr2aCaE3yWe0ZLyDvMTofUX.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP5846-CUSA30353_00-EDKURONOKISEKI01","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":53.4,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/1408/ytr2aCaE3yWe0ZLyDvMTofUX.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki (Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"CLOUDED LEOPARD ENTERTAINMENT INC.","ReleaseDate":"2022-02-06","Slug":"the-legend-of-heroes-kuro-no-kiseki-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":89,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":53.4,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-28","description":"Over twenty years ago in Harran, we fought the virus\u2014and lost.

His new destructive capabilities makes the high-speed action more satisfying than ever! INTI CREATES is proud to present new apeX of cutting-edge 2D action with Luminous Avenger iX 2! ●2D action that breaks new ground! With his new spinning blade weapon, the Razor Wheel, Copen rips through any enemy standing in his way as he traverses an enormous tower. A wide variety of stages with powerful boss characters lurking in them await him. Copen earns a new EX Weapon for his arsenal whenever he defeats a boss. He uses these weapons to target enemies' weak points to bring them down faster; a key strategy to clearing stages and ascending the tower quickly. Copen's Bullit Dash that allows him to fly freely through the air has also been powered up! Super-stylish maneuvers reward those who master the Bullit Dash's high-speed capabilities! ●Tear through your enemies at break-neck speed! Copen takes on all challenges by changing seamlessly between his two forms: the power-focused \"Break-Shift\" and the speed-enhanced \"Bullit-Shift.\" Crush your enemies in Break-Shift to bank points and activate Overdrive! In Overdrive, Copen can stay in Bullit-Shift mode longer, allowing him to zip through the air at high speed. ●The \"Muse of Hope\" Lola is lovelier than ever! Her songs really light up the stage! When Copen's HP hits 0, Lola can transform and activate her Anthem skill to bring Copen back to life using the power of song. She brings that recovery power to the frontlines in Luminous Avenger iX 2 with her newest and cutest form yet: Healing Mode! This powerful new ability heals Copen to full HP at any time, anywhere, and as often as he likes...with no cost! Build up over 1000 Kudos points and Lola will really heat up the battle with her song! ●An intense standalone story!

Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock\u2019s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal\u2014your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.

In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness.

Venture with your tribe into the untamed wilds of Midgard to gather precious resources, hunt mythical beasts, defeat mighty foes, topple giants, and claim treasures.

A neon-lit dystopian cityscape becomes the stage for thrilling adventure and deep yuri romance in this cyberpunk-themed visual novel. The complex personalities and experiences of more than 20 characters are interwoven across multiple paths and possible endings. Your choices matter, not only to you, but to all those with whom you struggle to connect. Cila, a veteran cop with a sour outlook and anger issues expects nothing more from life besides the smell of ozone, blinding neon lights and the ever-present manhole steam. That is, until a shady friend replaces her broken-down housedroid as a favor. Advanced, more efficient and remarkably perceptive, unit M.A.R.A. begins to penetrate Cila's toughened exterior and possibly even heal her new owner's old wounds \u2013 if Cila can decipher the recurring nightmare the process brings. Soon Cila and Mara forge a unique, if sometimes uneasy bond. Unbeknownst to Cila, just as her life begins to find its new normal, the technological giant Velta Labs gets wind of Mara's existence and takes a mysterious interest in the android. A war unlike any before is brewing on the horizon, its players are silently being selected and one android's fate may spell the difference between peace, war, the blossoming of a new religion or a technological singularity beyond comprehension.

Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird.

Ryza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively. ■ More action-filled real-time battles!

By allowing players to experience a part of modern Japan in a realistic way that they never could in any other game, it has now become a series that has sold over 12,000,000 copies.

We here at Bend Studio recommend playing through the story mode before viewing the art book. Days Gone is an open-world action-adventure game set in a harsh wilderness two years after a devastating global pandemic. Play as Deacon St. John, a drifter and bounty hunter who rides the broken road, fighting to survive while searching for a reason to live. \u2022Harsh Open World: Using the power of PlayStation®4 and Unreal Engine 4, Days Gone offers an incredibly realistic and detailed open-world experience. Immerse yourself in vast and hostile environments, and explore their secrets. Search abandoned vehicles, houses, truck stops and towns as you scavenge for resources. But be careful\u2014 day and night cycles, along with dynamic weather systems, all affect gameplay and enemy behavior. \u2022Brutal Sandbox Combat: Perfect your gameplay with an endless combination of strategy and play in every situation. Craft customized items using pieces and parts found in the field, from brutal melee weapons to traps and more. Act wisely, as every choice can be the difference between life and death. \u2022Unique Enemies: In addition to human drifters, marauders and militia, Deacon must face a wilderness overrun by Freakers\u2014 mindless, feral creatures. Although more animal than human, Freakers are smart and quickly evolving. As with any living creature, they have needs, habits, and behaviors that Deacon must learn and adjust to. \u2022Unique Setting: Adapt to quick environmental changes inspired by the harsh high-desert of the Pacific Northwest. One minute, Deacon is riding through a dense alpine forest\u2014or snow field or lush meadow\u2014 and the next, he\u2019s fighting his way through harsh desert lava fields and caves. Ancient lava flows scar and define the hazardous environments, delivering a breathtaking and diverse backdrop of regions to explore. From small towns and mountains to cliffs and river basins, explore the beautiful but threatening world, left in the wake of humanity\u2019s destruction. \u2022Compelling Story: At its core, Days Gone is about survivors and what makes them human: desperation, loss, madness, betrayal, friendship, brotherhood, regret, love\u2014 and hope. It\u2019s about how, even when confronted with such enormous tragedy, hope never dies.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-13","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1206/dREhjM5ezzlBvWjMXKGmX0UW.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP9000-CUSA09115_00-ASIADD0000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Adventure, Horror","PlusPrice":34.45,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1206/dREhjM5ezzlBvWjMXKGmX0UW.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Days Gone Digital Deluxe Edition (English, Korean, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2019-04-25","Slug":"days-gone-digital-deluxe-edition-english-korean-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":68.9,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":34.45,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-28","description":"\u201cCatherine Fullbody PS Store Glamourous Edition\u201d set includes: ■\u201dCatherine Fullbody\u201dGame title ■Early purchase bonus:Persona5 playable character \u201dJoker\u201d & phantom thieves Special broadcast set ■\u201dCatherine Fullbody\u201d limited theme Sexy and cute theme made originally by Shigenori Soejima.

Please apply the latest patch. Welcome to the 1940\u2019s. Europe is being torn apart by the war, the USA is preparing for battle and the mob does business as usual. Only this time they went too far, even for Vinnie\u2019s standards. Prepare yourself to go to war after you make a shocking discovery about what actually happened during the end-stage of the Thugtown Massacre from Guns, Gore & Cannoli 1. \"Just when you thought you were out, we\u2019re pulling you back in!\" STORY 1944, the war in Europe is entering its final stage. 15 years have passed since Vinnie survived the Thugtown Massacre. But now, some loose ends start crawling out of the past, dragging Vinnie as far as the European battlefield of World War 2. Find out who is chasing Vinnie around like a dog, turning all his friends into foes. KEY FEATURES Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 continues the rich, engaging gangster story of the first game and includes all the fast paced action you\u2019ve come to love, we made the best even better, with: Upgraded character mobility Vinnie has received a massive upgrade in his mobility features. 360 aiming, double jumping, kicking, jump-kicking, dodge rolls, somersaults, dual guns and a weapon wheel. Campaign mode Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 features a full single or multiplayer campaign mode, packed with action, humor and animated cutscenes. Rich environments We pushed our artists to the limits to produce the best immersive, atmospheric backgrounds, smoothest animations, and coolest special effects, setting a new benchmark for 2D games. Look for opportunities to bring down walls, explode barrels, drop crates on top of enemies, blow up cars and even kick your enemies through doors. Enjoy watching the corpses of your enemies fly through the air like ragdolls after you blast them away with your rocket launcher. Immersive world and period Walk around in the European battlefields of World War 2. Every level of Guns, Gore & Cannoli breathes the 1940\u2019s. Every inch of the game is like a picture straight from the second World War era. The cars, the furniture, the speakeasy clubs, the music, the propaganda posters, the streets and the weaponry reflect the turbulent time that the 1940\u2019s were. Online and local Co-op mode You don\u2019t want to die alone in the trenches? Well round up a platoon of 4 players and get blasting. Play as Vinnie in the solo campaign, or with up to 3 friends together while fighting through hordes of Nazis, zombies, monster, gangsters, cops, soldiers, tanks, submarines... in this all-new and incredibly fun arcade-style co-op action game. Teamwork is essential to surviving waves of enemy goons. Humor \u2018War is hell\u2019 unless you are Vinnie Cannoli and you turn every problem into a cynical joke, blurting out one-liners and snappy comments after a nice, juicy kill. Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 will be a fun experience, not only to play but also to watch. Funny one-liners, screaming deaths, comical dialogs and hilarious enemies make you play this violent kill-simulator with a smirky grin on your face.

The Special Edition of Dead by Daylight includes the base game, two additional chapters (Of Flesh and Mud, Spark of Madness) and two cosmetic add-ons packed with outfits for various characters (the 80's Suitcase for Survivors, the Bloodstained Sack for Killers).
