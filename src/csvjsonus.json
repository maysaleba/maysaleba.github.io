In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing.

Choose appropriate guardians for your heirs, or train them yourself. But what do you do if the legal heir is not quite up to the job? Violent characters may develop a fearsome reputation, cowering your timid subjects into obedience with the dread you inspire. WARFARE Recruit men-at-arms units and powerful knights to supplement your royal levies. Research new technologies to increase the wealth and military might of your realm. Hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major wars. Supplement your income with ransomed prisoners or raiding parties on neighboring realms. INTRIGUE Use your spymaster to discover plots against your dynasty and your rule. Recruit agents to assist your schemes to undermine or murder anyone who stands between you and power. Seduce other characters for love or political power. Gather information for blackmailing purposes or call in favors whenever your plans need an extra bit of influence.","SaleStarted":"2023-11-13","LowestPrice":"/game/71763","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/1607/czGau6hOvx9iQYOOkACdxqDl.png?w=200","MainStory":70,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4139-PPSA02307_00-TTL0000000000001","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8N_6xtr0Q","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":585,"genre":"Strategy, Simulation","PlusPrice":999999,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/1607/czGau6hOvx9iQYOOkACdxqDl.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/crusader-kings-iii/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","Title":"Crusader Kings III","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Paradox Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-29","Slug":"crusader-kings-iii-ps5-us","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/8zeepLS3vN","IsPS5":1,"Price":49.99,"MainExtra":158,"SalePrice":29.99,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"85","SaleEnds":"2023-11-28","description":"If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

France, 1944 \u2013 As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. EXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission.

The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor \u2014 the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You\u2019ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall \u2014 a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there \u2014 a horde of relentless zombies. DAY\u2019S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT\u2019S FOR THE DEAD Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems\u2026 fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it\u2019s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let\u2019s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.","SaleStarted":"2023-11-13","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/2908/7aJhOMuJALdBPqZHVy3CgJsg.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3050-PPSA02261_00-DL2GAME0000000US","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMev8gw47HI","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":999999,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/2908/7aJhOMuJALdBPqZHVy3CgJsg.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/dying-light-2-stay-human/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","Title":"Dying Light 2 Stay Human PS4&PS5","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"TECHLAND PUBLISHING","ReleaseDate":"2022-02-04","Slug":"dying-light-2-stay-human-ps4ps5-ps4&ps5-us","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/2L7ktIqaeW","IsPS5":1,"Price":59.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":29.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"76","SaleEnds":"2023-11-28","description":"Ghostrunner is a hardcore FPP slasher packed with lightning-fast action, set in a grim, cyberpunk megastructure.

To survive, Jacob must battle his way to safety to escape Black Iron Prison, while uncovering the dark and disturbing secrets buried beneath the surface of Callisto. Using a unique blend of shooting and close-quarters combat, Jacob will need to adapt his tactics to combat the rapidly evolving creatures while scavenging to unlock new weapons, gear, and abilities to outrun the growing threat and escape the horrors of Jupiter's Dead Moon. HORROR ENGINEERING The Callisto Protocol is a next-generation take on survival horror from the mind of Glen Schofield. Blending atmosphere, tension, and brutality with terrifying moments of helplessness and humanity, The Callisto Protocol immerses players in a pulse-pounding story where unspeakable horrors lurk around every corner. UNCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE UNITED JUPITER COMPANY Set on Jupiter\u2019s dead moon Callisto in the year 2320, The Callisto Protocol casts players as Jacob Lee, an inmate in Black Iron Prison. When a mysterious outbreak throws the moon into chaos, Jacob must face his darkest fears to defeat the bloodthirsty creatures that stalk him as he unravels the dark mysteries at the heart of the powerful United Jupiter Company. MASTER BRUTAL, STRATEGIC COMBAT The Callisto Protocol challenges players to master a thrilling blend of hand-to-hand and ranged combat, including a unique gravity weapon once used by Black Iron guards to control the prison population. Players will be forced to get up close and personal with their grotesque opponents, hacking off limbs, blasting off legs, and getting creative with whatever is at their disposal to survive each life-or-death encounter. EXPERIENCE THE ISOLATION OF JUPITER'S DEAD MOON One of the most hostile, isolated environments in the universe, Callisto looms large over Jacob\u2019s desperate struggle to survive. Players must not only contend with the horrors of Black Iron Prison, but also the centuries-old secrets that plague Jupiter\u2019s long-dead moon, both above and below the surface.","SaleStarted":"2023-11-13","LowestPrice":"/game/85967","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202206/0222/pqZVlL42HwbUMdSAyNQoRnzg.png?w=200","MainStory":10,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5082-PPSA03351_00-5673272224775858","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnVhgyLbC8A","PercentOff":"65%","Completionist":15,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":999999,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202206/0222/pqZVlL42HwbUMdSAyNQoRnzg.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-callisto-protocol/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","Title":"The Callisto Protocol™ PS5","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"KRAFTON, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2022-12-02","Slug":"the-callisto-protocol-ps5-ps4&ps5-us","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/3L0I44muMC","IsPS5":1,"Price":69.99,"MainExtra":11,"SalePrice":24.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2023-11-28","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race. A new recovery mechanic Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating. The lower the rating, the more the recovery profile penalises the race-day condition.","SaleStarted":"2023-11-13","LowestPrice":"/game/109504","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/mDRlUb0UyukoAVgxgkjKZ1CF.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6665-CUSA27350_00-TDF2100000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi76_U3Xegk","PercentOff":"90%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Sports","PlusPrice":2.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/mDRlUb0UyukoAVgxgkjKZ1CF.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/tour-de-france-2021/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Title":"Tour de France 2021 PS4","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-03","Slug":"tour-de-france-2021-ps4-ps4-us","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/10cNJOm3ZV","IsPS5":0,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":2.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"58","SaleEnds":"2023-11-28","description":"Boss, Fixer, Scorch, and Sev, better known as Delta Squad, are back on PlayStation 4®!

Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That\u2019s what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience without equal. Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew\u2019s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement. The Tightest Crew The legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. Ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, one born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake. In order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan. Give in to your greed Give outlet to your greed and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash and jewelry and any other valuables they might come across, you\u2019ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics and accolades. It won\u2019t be as simple as showing up and gaining goodies. You\u2019ll have to work hard and plan smart to get away with as much loot as possible. Gain experience, unlock new skills and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges. The Art of Heisting A professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays. Thrive in Co-op Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends in mind, whether you bring them from your childhood or make them along the road. The PAYDAY-series has always valued the bonds made through hardship and tries to reflect that in the actions and words of our heisters while in the game, and through our community while on the outside.","SaleStarted":"2023-11-13","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2909/a1a027289fadb563ddc04c1a3ec0f2b7f4f9f8dd7fe378c2.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP8268-PPSA14410_00-PAYDAY3GOLDSIEA0","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":71.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2909/a1a027289fadb563ddc04c1a3ec0f2b7f4f9f8dd7fe378c2.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"PAYDAY 3: Gold Edition","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"PLAION","ReleaseDate":"2023-09-21","Slug":"payday-3-gold-edition-ps5-us","IsPS5":1,"Price":89.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":71.99,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-11-28","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4® version and the digital PS5® version of this game.

R. R. Tolkien or whether you are exploring The Lord of the Rings for the first time, the Precious Edition offers an even more immersive game experience. This edition includes: - The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ base game. - The Sindarin VO DLC, which adds a touch of authenticity to dialogue with the Elves. - The Lore Compendium DLC, a treasure trove of information about the game's key characters, locations and events, taking you deep into the history of Middle-earth. - The Original Soundtrack application so you can listen to the game soundtrack whenever you want. - The Art Exhibition application that takes you behind the scenes of the game creation process with lots of sketches and development secrets. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ is an official adaptation based on the literary works of J.R.R Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose\u2026 How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring ™, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself\u2026 or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn't break; he bends, he adapts\u2026 Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It's up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","SaleStarted":"2023-11-13","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1516/cec5fbb61cd4453f65ef3a79fd63af8b8b7548cb22c91c4f.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6665-PPSA06367_00-LRG00DELUXE00001","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":27.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1516/cec5fbb61cd4453f65ef3a79fd63af8b8b7548cb22c91c4f.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ - Precious Edition","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2023-05-25","Slug":"the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum--precious-edition-ps4&ps5-us","IsPS5":1,"Price":69.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":34.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-11-28","description":"Previous special offer price valid from 11-10-2023 to 25-10-2023 was (£49.49 / \u20ac59.99 / AU $90.71 / BGN 119.92 / CZK 1424.25 / DKK 445.5 / HUF 20617 / NZ $97.46 / NOK 599.25 / PLN 269.25 / SEK 636.75 / USD $67.49 / ZAR 1071.75 / HRK 449.99 / INR 4995 / TRY 1079.25 / ILS 239.25) What is The Jackbox Party Trilogy 3.0?

Face all the dangers of both the Tower and Reclaimed to find the supply caches that await you. High risk, higher reward! The Meatgrinder Update - 7/14/2020 The bells have tolled. The dead are swarming. And you\u2019re the only living thing in sight. It\u2019s time for you to face The Meatgrinder. In this new update to The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, you\u2019ll be able to battle the undead in ways you never have before. Face relentless waves of walkers in The Trial, a special mode with all game weapons unlockable, stamina and health boosts and where your wits, skills, and whatever you can craft in the midst of the chaos will be your staunchest allies. Choose your arena, score big points through creative kills, and see how long you can survive. Do you want a more casual tour of New Orleans? Or maybe you consider yourself a hardened survivor? Try out the new difficulty option for the campaign for a new take on your undead adventure. Finally, prove yourself as an apocalyptic samurai with the new katana weapon aspect: \u2018Absolution\u2019. If you are going to slice and dice those who dare challenge you, you might as well do it in style, and forgive their sins. All this and more await you in The Meatgrinder. Face all the horrors that the living and the dead can offer in this new VR adventure in The Walking Dead universe. Travel through the ruins of walker infested New Orleans as you fight, sneak, scavenge, and survive each day unraveling a city wide mystery within the iconic quarters. Encounter desperate factions and lone survivors who could be friend or foe. Whether you help others or take what you want by force, every choice you make has consequences. What kind of survivor will you be for the people of NOLA? Explore New Orleans in a free roam survival horror adventure. Scavenge for anything that you can weapons, food, tools, and clues. Be wary of the living and the dead: spatial audio will draw attention to any loud noise, bullets or otherwise. Craft makeshift gear out of scrapped material blades, guns, medicine, and more. Survive your way: Use stealth or fight head on. Scavenge or complete jobs for others. Test your morals: make difficult choices for yourself and others.

Start with a pickaxe in one hand and nothing in the other. Excavate the bedrock, reap the rewards of Mother Earth, and trade the mined valuables for new gadgets, travels, funky wild fashion, and more. Cave Digger 2: Dig Harder is a 1-4-player VR action-adventure game set in wildland valleys, where you discover old mines, nautical caves, and ruins of ancient civilizations inspired by Western, Dieselpunk and Lovecraftian themes. Explore the \"pristine\" lands, loot its riches, and unravel the mystery linked to a great explorer. As you go, it's best to keep a six-shooter nearby just in case. Tools and Progression Get thrown right away into the deep end by being stuck in the mines as your drill machine broke. With a single pickaxe, work your way to the surface camp where your journey can begin in earnest. Your goal is simply to mine and carry loot back to the surface the best you can for your mission assigners. With the surplus reward that you get, you can buy new things like upgrading your dependable pickaxe with a shinier look! (And faster digging rate.) Or buy dynamites that work on pretty much anything that needs to be worked on. Maybe you fancy a shovel that works for both digging and moving through the caves like a spider-miner.

When inmates begin to transform into monstrous creatures, the prison is thrown into chaos. To survive, Jacob must battle his way to safety to escape Black Iron Prison, while uncovering the dark and disturbing secrets buried beneath the surface of Callisto.

PlatinumGames\u2019 NEO-CLASSIC ARCADE series carries on the spirit and fun of classic gaming using modern technology, and the first project in this endeavor is SOL CRESTA. SOL CRESTA takes the docking and formation strategies of classic shooting games Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta and elevates them with the \u201cfree-form docking\u201d system. The flagship Yamato, composed of the fighters Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susano can utilize various attacks depending on how the three ships are aligned. Docking, splitting, and reforming the ships as needed is the key to defeating the invading armies of Mega Zofer. Story Humanity faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Mandler Army during their last invasion of the solar system. Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune. With the last of their hope, they formed the solar recovery squad SOL CRESTA, and placed the fate of the solar system with the Yamato, a cutting-edge docking ship. -Free-Form Docking The Yamato, standing against the evil of Mega Zofer, is composed of 3 fighters. You\u2019ll scramble with only one fighter at first, but pick up the right item and friendly fighters will appear for a power-up!

Sabotage your opponents' economy or attack them with your Mech Units, conduct trade and beware of Space Pirates eager to board your Station. - The dynamic narrator AI \u201cVAL\u201d reacts to your decisions and is always at your side in both word and deed \u2013 and the occasional extremely unqualified comment. - In addition to the extensive single player Campaign, an individually configurable sandbox mode as well as both a competitive and a cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players awaits you.

Make your bullets count with the Peacemaker .45 Revolver where six bullets is enough to see six helmets fly. For those who need a few bullets more there is the Repeater 1874 Sniper Rifle. The Plainsrider Bow if you need no bullets at all. An arrow kills and doesn't make a sound. Unless you attach a pack of dynamite to it, which you can. The dynamite also comes as a throwable so you don't need to go through the potential hassle of having a bow. Ride off into the sunset with four new masks, and patterns.
