"77","2024-08-28","The latest instalment in the award-winning series, Sniper Elite 5 offers unparalleled sniping, tactical third-person combat and an enhanced kill cam. Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before. France, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. EXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other. ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL Use ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target. HIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION Use workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal. INVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP Invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation. TENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER Customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode. ENHANCED KILL CAM More realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2116/59jHCjMBRhuRhPUKUUy2gkNd.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4529-PPSA04444_00-SNIPERELITE50000","70%","0","Fighting, Action","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/sniper-elite-5","Sniper Elite 5","TRD","REBELLION DEVELOPMENTS LTD","2022-05-25","sniper-elite-5-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","629.70","1","1",

That’s right – we’re doing this again. The baa has been raised, and Pilgor is joined by other goats too. You can invite up to three friends in local or online co-op, create carnage as a team, or compete in mini-games and then not be friends anymore. Get ready for another round of udder mayhem. Lick, headbutt, and ruin your way through a brand new open world in the biggest waste of your time since Goat Simulator! We won’t tell you how to play (except in the tutorial), but merely provide the means to be the goats of your dreams. KEY FEATURES: - You can be a goat - Three of your friends can be goats too, and join you in local or online co-op - No really, there are so many goats. If you want to be fancy you can wear the skins of tall goats, stripey goats, and many more. There’s a goat for everyone! - Or dress up your goat in all kinds of nonsense, from toilet rolls to tea trays. Put on a jetpack for all we care - This time we actually hired ‘game designers’ and we’re told they’ve added ‘an ok amount of content’; events, NPCs to mess with, physics, status effects, collectables, easter eggs, lies, betrayal, heartbreak - They’ve added mini-games too, lots of mini-games (seven is a lot, right?) - Who said anything about a musical? - You can be Keanu Ree... (jk, wanted to check you were still reading) - But you can be a goldfish (true story) DISCLAIMER: Goat Simulator 3 is another completely stupid game. Will this game teach you how to become one with your local herd? Probably not.

Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. ""IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN"" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels…) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones for your style and shred the most iconic spots!","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/2412/267dcd99838eca943a1ab23184ecacde8a479ea56d9d37ad.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06510_00-SSSG000000000000","70%","0","Simulation, Sport","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/session-skate-sim","Session: Skate Sim","TRD","NACON SA","2022-09-22","session-skate-sim-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","0","524.70","1","",

"66","2024-08-28","It’s time to dust off your overalls and hitch on your toolbelt in Manic Mechanics – a chaotic couch co-op game where you and up to three fellow grease monkeys pay a visit to the car-obsessed Octane Isle. Your mission? Work your way around the island’s six neighbourhoods – from the rust buckets of Betty’s Scrapyard to the spooky shores of Banshee Bay – challenging the Master Mechanics that rule each part of town. Repair as many cars, trucks, choppers, tractors, mini-subs (and even UFOs) as possible to prove your worth in this hectic race against the clock. No two games are the same as you work your way through 30 unique garage levels, each one more challenging than the last. Completing a garage is one thing, but mastering it and beating your best score requires coordination, skill and determination. Octane Isle is a great place to visit, whether you go solo or bring along your friends. In co-op mode, up to four players work together as a finely-tuned machine, tracking their team’s best scores, unlocking new characters and discovering hidden secrets as they explore Octane Isle together. Or maybe you'll choose to head straight to the Versus Arena, split into teams and decide once and for all which crew truly rules the workshop? Whether you choose co-op or competitive, the action unfolds across local, wireless and online play. Just about anything can happen on Octane Isle... the faster you work, the more chaos is unleashed. Fuel ignites, tyres explode, robots short-circuit, cows stampede and aliens abduct, but with teamwork, skill - and maybe just a little luck - you'll earn the right to call yourselves a Manic Mechanic!","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/1217/0294dbfc7dc1e7d7e066e4b535deb26be7bbd922692ce90e.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8733-CUSA44406_00-0738875014798914","50%","0","Casual, Family, Party","335.6","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/manic-mechanics","Manic Mechanics","TRD","4J Studios Ltd.","2024-03-06","manic-mechanics-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","839.00","0","419.50","1","",

After the animals of Torch City were defeated by the invading Robotic Legion in the Resistance War six years ago, former Resistance fighter Rayton the rabbit has kept a low profile. The arrest of a friend meant he had no choice but to put on his giant metal fist and fight against those oppressing him. Little did he know that he would soon be caught up in a maelstrom of conspiracies involving the Legion, the Resistance, and the Rat Gang. ●Seamless Maps Filled with Challenges to Explore Explore more than a dozen unique areas in a Action Platformer style map. The core combat, puzzle-solving, and platform mechanics are complemented by countless hidden rooms, secret passages, and shortcuts, with all kinds of rewarding challenges for players to complete. Maps are loaded on the fly to avoid frequent transitions, making the massive Torch City feel even more detailed and alive. ●An Arcade Combat System with Seamless Switching between Three Weapons The Fist, Drill, and Whip are three weapons with completely different fighting styles that offer seamless switching between high combo, high damage, and long range attacks. Pummel the enemy by choosing the most appropriate form of attack for the situation. Players will be challenged by dozens of distinct types of enemies, each with their own weapons and attacks, all working together to bring the player down. Unique bosses with unusual fighting styles provide a new and unique gaming experience. ●Diesel-punk Aesthetics Crafted with Unreal Engine 4 The game's diesel-punk aesthetics were inspired by diesel combustion engines that were blended with an Eastern cityscape from a bygone era to give Torch City a signature one-of-a-kind visual feel. The stark contrast between furry animals and sterile mechanical soldiers introduce the theme of conflict in the game story. The realistic 3D visuals powered by Unreal Engine 4 combined with Physically-Based Rendering take the Action Platformer genre to a whole new level of graphics quality.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1407/a0v5crJH2yW6mjjLVLI5TeHB.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8192-PPSA03969_00-FISTSIEEPS5HD002","60%","0","Action","101.43","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/fist-forged-in-shadow-torch","F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch","TRD","Shanghai Hode Information Technology Co.,Ltd.","2021-09-06","fist-forged-in-shadow-torch-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","289.84","0","115.93","1","",

CREATE THE PARKS OF YOUR DREAMS As creative lead of the park, you can let your imagination off the leash!

But, you can also take things to the next level with unbelievable modules that add unique pizazz to your park.

Destroy things with style and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky's the limit!

Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable. It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive… A destination with plenty of surprises Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn.

Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive. Home sweet home Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. The more the merrier… You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable. Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.

The players will have to crack some grim criminal cases by exploring the world around them, rediscover the mysterious identity of the protagonist, cross the borders of inherent dangers and formal logic and create their own vision of time and history. BECOME A MYSTERY HUNTER A true hunter always trusts their gut instincts. They see moments of doubt as a waste of time as the path to the truth lies clear before their mind’s eye. It’s an intricate network of barely visible strings and links between other people’s secrets, mysteries and motives… You just have to pull the right string which will lead you to the solution. Become a hunter whose primary weapons are his mind and heart. COMPOSE YOUR VISION OF THE WORLD FROM BITS OF INFORMATION The main feature of this game is the unusual mix of sci-fi, social fiction, detective and horror. Each genre presents a unique story; the players may freely combine fragments of information from them all to create their own versions of this world, its history and the causes of main events. The identity of the protagonist is a mystery itself, and you’ll have to approach the storyline like a puzzle to solve it. FOLLOW THE STORIES OF THOSE WHO GOT LOST IN THIS LABYRINTH BEFORE Each and every person who had passed through this world before the protagonist came had their own vision of what was going on. Each and every one of them left some clues. The data that you’ll eventually gather might sometimes be inconsistent and controversial, but there will also be similar or even duplicate bits of valuable information. Trying to make any sense out of all this is hard, but the process itself will definitely bring you closer to the truth.

"","2024-08-28","""Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined,"" wrote Albert Camus, and it is hard to disagree with this. To contemplate one's life means to knock oneself down, to stop, to begin to go over one's experiences, to discard the superfluous and unnecessary, to destroy the old in the hope of constructing the new, in other words, to be undermined. It is impossible not to note the severity of this word because this action is associated with pain, loss, the need to choose difficult routes, and sometimes taking risks so as not to make new mistakes and not to fall off the set path. But is it worth enduring the pain? What happens if we simply go with the flow? How will our lives turn out then? The French philosopher Albert Camus asked similar questions in his famous essay ""The Myth of Sisyphus. In brief, the ancient Greek myth is as follows: the gods condemned Sisyphus, because he was too arrogant and too dodgy, to roll a huge stone up the mountain, which kept falling and had to start all over again. It would seem that what could be worse than this useless work? What was Sisyphus thinking as he climbed to the top of the mountain? And what do we care about him? Maybe we should admit that our lives are a bit like this Sisyphus? Approach Albert Camus's thoughts and feelings, his philosophy. Perhaps you will find some answers to these difficult questions. • Explore the world around you and find philosophical notes. • Take the stone to the top, higher and higher, and if it falls, well, start over, that's your punishment. • Choose your path correctly. Your decisions will determine the end of the game. • Discover the philosophy of Albert Camus. Don't try to understand every word, just let it pass through you. • Enjoy the abstract game world, and find different ways of passing. • And also listen to atmospheric music and sound effects.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/1720/2ec7923b93669974f8483c69eb15b79f726c80c93b2ed5f8.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2029-CUSA44262_00-0936199158514762","70%","0","Adventure","69.8","null","null","Heavy Burden","TRD","Whale Rock Games OOO","2024-01-23","heavy-burden-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","104.70","1","",

Optimize costs and employ seasonal workers only during the harvest time. Accept challenges from neighbors to prove who is the best farmer in the area. You do not want to cultivate typical wheat, don't you? Perhaps you would love to have an orchard with apples, strawberries or cucumbers? In Farm Tycoon you can have more than 20 different crops that you can cultivate by hand or using machines, where each harvest has a precise expiration date. Before you plant your seedlings, first remember about the proper preparation of the land for cultivation. Watch your plants as they grow from green, fragile seedlings up to the state of flowering, ripening and ready for harvest. Do not forget about watering in periods of drought. If plants are not cared for properly they become ill, lose their quality and eventually die. On the machine market you can buy both new and used agricultural machinery. You have a choice between nearly 40 machines. Remember that cheaper, used machines can break down more quickly, especially when inexperienced employee operates the machine. Before buying your first agricultural machine, build a garage to ensure sufficient space to park it. A real farm is not just about agriculture fields. You can choose from more than 40 buildings, starting from farm buildings and barns to processing plants and factories. Has the plague affected your harvest? Maybe it is time to invest in a factory? Build a specialized factory to process what you have managed to grow. Produce juices and frozen food. Have you produced too much sheep's, cow's or goat's milk? Start producing cheese or butter, unless you prefer to switch your farm for the production of meat. The cultivation of plants is not enough? Farm Tycoon allows for breeding animals. Starting from the smallest such as bees, rabbits or turkeys, but you can also breed goats and cows. Be sure to provide them with adequate animal feed and skilled caregivers. Raise newly purchased animals before they begin to produce eggs or milk. Bees love buckwheat and colza, so create fields with suitable plants nearby. When the animals get sick you will need to call the vet, and if you want to breed your animals, you'll have to call the inseminator. Face variable weather conditions such as drought or torrential rain and collect all the crops before the first frost and snow. Look for a rainbow during a gentle rain or watch the lengthening shadows, changing sunlight and color depending on the current season. At any time you can enter the photo mode to take spectacular shots of your farm bathed in warm autumnal colors, or in a dark scenery during a lightning storm in the background.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/0513/aa1e3008b8b5be3cc8120bc5b4c5157beab5645f3c2b4ebc.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1549-PPSA20238_00-CLABS1FT20231109","40%","0","Educational, Simulation, Strategy","1259.4","null","null","Farm Tycoon","TRD","PlayWay plc","2023-12-15","farm-tycoon-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","1259.40","0","",

"","2024-08-28","A story from the legends, but in real history Winter War: over 500,000 Soviet soldiers attack Finland, a country with a population of 3,700,000, and the Finns drive them back, inflicting 5 times their own casualties. Continuation War: the Reds return with a total strength of 1,500,000 - almost half of the entire Finnish population - and the Finns stop them again. Finland’s survival in these two brutal wars against an enemy so vast was a true historical miracle. A miracle of heroism and valor. A miracle of the Finnish spirit of liberty. Experience heroic struggle and make tough choices You are the commander of the scarce Finnish troops. Your only goal - to save your homeland and your people from total annihilation. Would you risk losing your experienced troops to try and capture the enemy tanks? Would you try to save the stragglers during the retreat and risk losing everyone, or cut your losses and establish a new line of defense? Would you agree to negotiate with the Soviets that had treacherously attacked you twice before? Play two campaigns: historical and “what if” Historical campaign: Play through a number of missions throughout the 1939-1945 timeline, spanning three wars: Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War. The historical campaign will have smaller-scale but action-packed operations, covering all of the iconic historical battles. Complete numerous objectives grounded in history and narrated by a number of historical characters. Alternate history campaign: Play a shorter campaign with larger operations, centered around the “what if” events. Help the Germans take Leningrad, cut off the allied aid shipments to USSR by taking the port of Murmansk - that is only the beginning. Features: Immerse yourself into the history-driven gameplay: Thanks to cinematics before and after each operation you’ll watch history unfold through the eyes of the key historical figures of the time. Create and grow the army of your own design: Use a number of historical vehicles - all of which are available at historically accurate points in time. Train your troops and choose equipment: Choose various skills for your men as they gain combat experience. Combine units from different classes and acquire diverse equipment for them! Use historical heroes: Every unit could meet certain high requirements to generate a hero with a unique set of powerful skills. For Example the deadliest sniper in WW2 history - Simo Häyhä Manage your Headquarters between the operations: More firepower or better intel - choose in which direction your HQ staff will improve. Use elaborate combat mechanics to overcome any foe: Lethal vs Nonlethal damage or using terrain differences to your advantage - those are just a few of the combat mechanics in-game. Utilize advanced supply and infrastructure systems: All units have limited ammo and fuel that are necessary to operate. You can use this and cut enemy supplies!","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/0412/7be3130e648346b605f98c4c8947b69725d22aa371a8500d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA16443_00-0902122838417649","35%","0","Strategy, Strategy","999999","null","null","Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty","TRD","Klabater","2023-10-26","strategic-mind-spirit-of-liberty-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","0","681.85","1","",

"","2024-08-28","There’s an old tradition running in your homeland: to become an adult and complete the coming of age ritual, you must go on a journey of discovery. Your adventure begins on a distant island, deep in a tropical Archipelago. What was once a prosperous tourist destination is now a shade of its former glory: and it’s your job to bring it back to life! Explore the Archipelago, meet the locals, and lend them a hand to restore the tourist paradise… while you try to uncover the mysteries of your past! SETTLING IN A NEW PLACE Your tropical life will be a busy one, so grab your tools and let’s get started! First things first: you’ll need a source of food, a place to spend the night in, and some resources to build a farm and kickstart your tropical journey. So what are you waiting for — time to explore your lands! A PLETHORA OF ACTIVITIES There’s plenty to do in Spirit of the Island! No matter how you choose to spend your time, you will gain experience and improve your skills, unlock new recipes, and become more efficient at everything you do, which will make your new life easier. Spirit of the Island features 10 unique skills, such as farming, mining, foraging, social, and even fishing, which comes as its own special mini-game. Will you become a true master of all? YOUR JOURNEY TO A TOURIST PARADISE Make your island not only a welcoming home but also a booming tourist paradise, with fancy shops and landmarks. The more tourists you get, the better your economy will be, which is a crucial step to fund your journeys to the faraway Islands. But how do you please them all, and what do you sell in your stores? That’s where your skills will come in handy! Sell local produce; open museums to display the treasure and secrets you uncover on your adventures. We bet some of your visitors could even buy a couple of quality wooden planks, so do your best to improvise! THE BEST TRIP EVER Each tourist will have a chance to love your Island so much that they’ll decide to stay, adding to the Town’s population. This part is crucial since you can hire them to do various things for you, such as tending to your shops and helping you maintain the Island. So do your best to make their trip a fantastic one! THE POWER OF TWO One of the main features of Spirit of the Island is a 2-player cooperative mode, where you can do… everything together! You will have all single-player mode features available in online play with its own unique story. Grow crops, set up a store, and sell your produce to tourists, explore the vast Archipelago, and discover the secrets of the tropical paradise together with a friend! VAST TROPICAL ARCHIPELAGO Spirit of the Island features 14 explorable islands, each with its own fauna, secrets, and dangers. Information on who - or what - inhabits these islands has been lost to history, but you will find mysterious caves guarded by ancient creatures — are you brave enough to explore them and uncover the mysteries within? Doing so will net you neat rewards and help you proceed towards your final goal: revealing the secret of your past. THE LOCAL COMMUNITY The Archipelago is bustling with life! Meet more than 14 unique characters, each with its own distinct traits and quirks. And yes, there are romance options as well! Depending on your character, you’ll be able to romance and marry different NPCs and hold a grandiose wedding in the end! AN EVENTFUL LIFE One of the unique features of Spirit of the Island is events — a series of recurring occurrences happening through each in-game year (4 months). They will come in various forms: from birthdays and traditional Holidays to your own unique events. There’s always something fun happening in Town, so make sure to check your calendar often!","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/1615/jfTgsNhsgDDUp0kpRg2yoevL.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1302-PPSA13934_00-0584770477306422","30%","0","Adventure, Simulation, Party","568.75","null","null","Spirit of the Island","TRD","Plug In Digital","2023-10-19","spirit-of-the-island-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","0","612.50","1","",

ENDLESS™ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESS™ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her ""unusual"" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESS™ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0605/NqS2wkRWsphmkL2kpu5seE0W.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0177-PPSA02665_00-ENDLESSDELUXEEU0","25%","0","Strategy, Action","1311.75","null","null","ENDLESS™ Dungeon Last Wish Edition","TRD","SEGA EUROPE LTD","2023-10-17","endless-dungeon-last-wish-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","0","1311.75","1","",

Tackle challenging encounters with your party of two characters, using a variety of skills and highly interactive environments. Maybe you'll light an enemy on fire and kick them into a grain field for a proper barbeque, or set up a trap and fell a tree on top of them. The options are endless, and you're the one in charge! You have control over time The core of Iron Danger is its unique time control mechanic. You can rewind time up to 5 seconds whenever you want, trying different strategies and combinations of moves until you find the right one for the task at hand. The time manipulation allows us to combine real-time combat gameplay with controls from more traditional, tactical turn-based combat games. This gives tactical combat a puzzle-like element, as you can keep trying new approaches to turn impossible odds to your advantage and synchronize the actions of your characters for the perfect outcome. You will die, but you will not fail! Iron Danger is set in a world of lofty fells, primeval forest, and placid lakes...as well as living gods and monsters of steel. The city of Kalevala, home of the humans who rebelled against the gods and forsook their protection, shines in the middle of this world, surrounded by towns, sea lanes and woodlands under its protection. But from the frozen north, a witch queen is leading her army on a quest for vengeance against the lords of Kalevala. Ancient ruins from the days when gods dwelled on the earth are opening to unleash forgotten powers, tempting humans and striving to overtake the world. You’ll take on the role of Kipuna, a sharp-witted village girl, who becomes imbued with an ancient power that grants dominion over time and death. You must use your wits to control it as you’re drawn into a war between the city of Kalevala and the armies of the Northlanders driven by their witch queen Lowhee. Your task is to master the power, in order to use it for mankind’s protection, while your enemies seek to harness it in the service of total destruction.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2114/58030e86a07917a7b43b63059fa93780a7b7c79e428eb767.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8923-PPSA12357_00-IRONDANGEREU0000","90%","0","Strategy, Role Playing Games","69.9","null","null","Iron Danger","TRD","Daedalic Entertainment GmbH","2023-08-16","iron-danger-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","69.90","0","",

We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner. You will progress through main missions, you’ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises... If you’ll be prospering, you’ll get the chance to create and manage bases in five different regions, each with its own, more and more challenging missions. From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there’ll be a pesky agent who’ll want to work with you, and there’ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You’re a free man, after all. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught! Features: [*]a faithful reflection of the moonshine craft - fermentation and distillation based on chemical formulas behaving as natural processes [*]a realistic recreation of an American moonshiner’s business, with all its challenges [*]a rich story - 3 possible successful endings or a “Game Over” if caught by the authorities [*]5 regions - running the base in the mountains, forest, swamps, town, and city, with linear progression [*]70+ recipes - 15+ moonshines, 15+ whiskies, 20 brandies, 20+ vodkas [*]50+ ingredients - sugars, fruits, vegetables, and grains [*]35+ apparatuses - 17 distillation stills, 8 fermentation tanks, 5 post-distillation tanks, 7 pre-fermentation apparatuses, and more [*]26 fermentation and distillation technologies [*]37 main quests + side quests and road events [*]Original Score - 19 tracks that embrace the vibe of illegal activities in American mountains.

Additional characters can be purchased separately, so please be wary of purchasing the same character multiple times. A legendary arcade game developed by Dimps in 2005. This fighting game gained popularity for its smooth visuals powered by S.M.A as well as the high level of strategy driven by its 2-gauges system. And with the addition of new current-gen features it's even easier to play. - Battle Mechanics Polished to a Shine by a Legendary Studio Known for Fighters: The first original fighting game from Dimps, known for being involved in a number of other fighting games.

It uses Rollback Netcode, which corrects lag between players, making for a streamlined experience online. And with 16:9 wide-screen support, AI and a training mode, you can fully enjoy this game in the comfort of your own home. - Main Game Modes: ・Arcade ・Survival ・Time Attack ・Local Multiplay ・Online Multiplay with rollback netcode ・Training ・Gallery Added features: Spectator mode, rematch, match recording, combat range and match time settings, assist mode, new character colors, button assignment for Boost Dive, and an updated training mode including character-specific gauge and enemy attack/dodge/ground recovery settings, as well as adjustments to enemy auto recovery timing. - The Story: It is the end of the 20th century... A large-scale natural disaster struck the eastern area of a nation. It wiped out the financial sector and resulted in a staggering loss of life. At the dawn of the 21st century, the conglomerate PROBE-NEXUS, commonly known as Probe, began reconstruction efforts in that eastern area. Colossal capital and cutting-edge technology was poured into rebuilding it. Skyscrapers that put the old high-rises to shame along with the world's biggest shopping mall and recreational facilities. This was the dazzling birth of a symbol for the new century. It was christened Zone Prime. And now, in an undeveloped sector of its western block, there was an area known as the slums... - Additional Characters: ・Greed A survivor of the illegal fighting organization ""Valor"". He joined the tournament ""F.F.S."" again in order to fight against a yet-to-be-seen strong fighter. ・Hazama A new president of the PROBE-NEXUS, ostensibly to support the new chairman, Beatrice. But behind the scenes, he is working in the dark to extend his own power. ・Beatrice A granddaughter of Mr. Brad. And after his retirement, she succeeded him as Chairman of PROBE-NEXUS. Despite of her beauty, she has an extremely cold personality inside.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2114/ead91203df54dfedd208708d5e4721c81d98fa80bd215e15.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4579-PPSA09141_00-GAMEAND3DLCPS5EU","35%","0","Fighting","386.75","null","null","The Rumble Fish 2  - Deluxe Edition","TRD","3GOO K.K.","2023-06-05","the-rumble-fish-2-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","595.00","0","386.75","1","",

Lovingly Lamb-made animation Brought to you by award-winning animation studio Aardman the game features a beautiful hand-painted and traditionally animated art style, spectacular environments and endearing character animation. Reviews for Home Sheep Home 2 “It's like some sort of adorable vortex you never want to leave...there's something to be said for a game that goes out of its way to excel at style and quality, and Home Sheep Home 2 definitely has both by the bushel.” 4.7/5 – Jay Is Games “What’s more impressive about this game is how little is reused. Basic puzzle mechanics stay throughout (only by stepping on the button can you open the door) but the flow of the puzzles doesn’t repeat. Like Braid and Portal before it, there’s a desire to always present the player with new challenges, and it works. One moment you might be evading a giant boulder, only to be grabbing parachutes mid-air the next.” 9/10 – Thunderbolt Games “It looks like many of you really looked forward to this title on the forums, and I can say that it's taken all the concepts from the first game and made them bigger and better, and it doesn't disappoint in its execution.” 4/5 – Touch Arcade","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/1112/YviLrByQpDGOYCa2PFAujUYh.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2605-CUSA35725_00-3691250995454778","40%","0","Puzzle","135","null","null","Home Sheep Home: Farmageddon Party Edition","TRD","GREENLIGHT GAMES","2023-05-25","home-sheep-home-farmageddon-party-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","225.00","0","135.00","1","",
"0","2024-08-28","Whether you are a long-time fan of the world created by J. R. R. Tolkien or whether you are exploring The Lord of the Rings for the first time, the Precious Edition offers an even more immersive game experience. This edition includes: - The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ base game. - The Sindarin VO DLC, which adds a touch of authenticity to dialogue with the Elves. - The Lore Compendium DLC, a treasure trove of information about the game's key characters, locations and events, taking you deep into the history of Middle-earth. - The Original Soundtrack application so you can listen to the game soundtrack whenever you want. - The Art Exhibition application that takes you behind the scenes of the game creation process with lots of sketches and development secrets. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ is an official adaptation based on the literary works of J.R.R Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose… How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring ™, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself… or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn't break; he bends, he adapts… Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It's up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1516/cec5fbb61cd4453f65ef3a79fd63af8b8b7548cb22c91c4f.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG00DELUXE00001","80%","0","Adventure","499.8","null","null","The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ - Precious Edition","TRD","NACON SA","2023-05-25","the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-precious-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2499.00","0","499.80","1","",

The fearsome orc clans, more numerous than ever, lurk on all roads. The proud nomadic peoples of the steppes are on the alert, for strange beasts prowl the darkness. Not even the stout dwarves, hidden in their underground palaces, seem safe from threat - from the unknown tunnels of its mines, a foul army of hideous creatures advances inexorably.

A new hero is needed, a chosen one who is worthy to wield the Sword and destroy the enemy... this time forever. FOUR PLAYABLE CHARACTERS. Pick your Champion of Ianna — Tukaram, the Barbarian; Naglfar, the Dwarf; Sargon, the Knight; or Zoe, the Amazon — each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and fighting skills, as you hack ‘n slash your way through a blood-drenched quest to save the world from the forces of Chaos.

"","2024-08-28","The Gods have abandoned Midgard. Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","80%","0","Action, Adventure, Music/Rhythm","105","null","null","ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree","TRD","Untold Tales S.A.","2023-02-09","atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","0","105.00","1","",

Work together to escape, explore and solve puzzles in this mysterious Antarctic adventure. Be aware, nothing is what it seems - there are dark secrets hidden in the shadows. Will you be able to escape? Beginning in the dungeons deep in the bowels of Castle Rock, you and a fellow prisoner must seek a way out and return to stand again beneath the icy Antarctic skies - but escaping this nightmare is not so easy as just leaving the castle itself. If you can free yourself from the cells, you’ll need to make choices about where to explore next. Outside the Keep, you will discover the story of Rockbury, its inhabitants, and plans of a resistance formed against the King to escape this icy place. Hope will lead you on to an eerie Graveyard and have you descend down into the dark waters of the Foundry. Someone, or something, has brought you here, and you are a central part of a plan centuries in the making. Only an unshakeable bond with your partner will give you any hope of survival in the face of such dreadful desire… FEATURES • Two player co-op: the puzzles you encounter take two to solve - you both have a role to play!

"","2024-08-28","Use your grappling hook to swing around in giant levels, dash through energy crystals, find hidden secrets and master even the most difficult worlds. Play in free style or against the timer with one or two grappling guns and finish more than 10 enormous levels by dodging obstacles and deadly traps. It’s easy to play, it’s fast and it’s fun. You start the game in the middle of a giant city surrounded by skyscrapers. You look around and see a giant poster that explains the general movement. This way you learn that you are able to dash while being in the air. You also realize that you have a grappling gun in your hand and see floating crystals above your head. You aim at the crystals and use your grappling gun to hook onto them. Once hooked you start swinging and swing towards the next crystal. You hook on to the next crystal and have already mastered the main movement mechanism. After a couple of hooks, you realize that you can change your swinging direction and speed by dashing into the wanted direction. This is the second important thing to learn about the movement and gives you a lot of freedom in your movement. Soon you will reach the next giant poster which explains further movement patterns that you can use to improve your precision and movements. You learn that you can remove your grappling hook, use an in-air dash and then hook on to the next floating crystal to build up speed and energy. You can use this energy to collect hidden achievements, dash through activator crystals, that unlock new areas o the level, or speed run levels later on. Furthermore, you realize that the dash refreshes every couple of seconds which leads to an incredibly fast and satisfying movement once you are able to master it.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0616/xTpaVApaeqWLeKILuhVo3DMo.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6556-CUSA36652_00-7394737770687028","40%","0","Action, Casual, Family","124.5","null","null","Grappling Dash","TRD","EpiXR Games UG","2022-12-20","grappling-dash-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","249.00","0","149.40","1","",

"","2024-08-28","Play out a Kaiju movie as the mayor of Floatio city, tasked with holding off the overwhelming strength of a Kaiju attack with (hopelessly) outclassed military. Defend your city as five unique and devastating Kaiju grow in power with every attack. Unfortunately, they can't be killed, but can be slowed down and forced to fall back... for now. Monsters move towards the nearest building, and the scientists have mathed the exact odds of where they might go next. Build sacrificial army bases and airfields to distract the Kaiju. If standard methods aren't enough, deploy experimental weapons such as freeze rays and transforming mechas to keep them at bay. Or you can always park tanks and jets in the monsters’ path to slow them down (don't worry, we have a good insurance policy). If all your efforts fail, don't be ashamed and run away! Be prepared to evacuate the laboratory using transport trucks, boats, or planes when the Kaiju get too close. Play missions from all over the world as you progress through the fight against Kaiju in a 15+ hour story-based campaign. Throughout the campaign, you’ll have the chance to gain an advantage with upgradeable ACE units and Project Deck customization. Test your wits in tactical puzzles, command dozens of units in large-scale scenarios, and fend off repeated attacks in defense missions while developing your city economically. And if you’re hungry for more, test your command skills in weekly challenges! Features: Protect your city in a tactical battle with cannon-fodder tanks, jets, and more... unusual firepower. Face five different Kaiju - each with unique skills and potential for mutation. Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Do everything to stop the monsters, including sacrificing your units and buildings. Remember that you can’t kill Kaiju - you can only slow them down. Defend cities around the world in 15+ hours of campaign mode. Prove your command capabilities in weekly challenges.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202210/0313/kJJT6eZ2XQEGcGnoEGuKgzh6.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA33612_00-1692968410657931","55%","0","Strategy","279.6","null","null","Kaiju Wars","TRD","Klabater","2022-11-10","kaiju-wars-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","314.55","1","",

"","2024-08-28","Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, in most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-GASSTATIONSIM0EU","30%","0","Simulation","454.35","null","null","Gas Station Simulator","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2022-10-19","gas-station-simulator-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","489.30","1","",

Obstacles move in patterns over and around them, forcing you to learn their movements to avoid getting knocked off a ledge or halted midair. Mannequins surround you, sometimes navigating the platforms themselves or simply observing. Perhaps they hold clues about the puzzles at hand, or perhaps they are just like you. Either way, they offer little comfort. Back Again is an eerie tale with a minimalistic narrative and unsettling atmosphere intended to test your skills, question your psyche and reward your determination, all set to a unique and ever-changing soundtrack to suit the mood. See the story to its end, retrying each sequence as many times as it takes, and once you’ve built up enough confidence, choose Survival Mode to see if you can clear the entire game in a single attempt! Features: • Walk, run and jump across platforms in a harsh 3D puzzle-scape! • Navigate shifting obstacles by learning their patterns. • Witness creepy events and engage in a light narrative! • Get immersed with a unique ever-changing soundtrack. • Push your platforming skills to the limit in Survival Mode!

Players will also need to acquire weapons and armor at shops and treasure chests as well as utilize cards featuring useful effects to their advantage. Battle A Battle Mode can be played separately from the Battle Squares found in the boardgame. Develop characters and form a party of up to four members and take on the 200-floor Tower of Despair where Monokuma-type monsters await.

"","2024-08-28","A unique first-person life simulation game of a lumberjack building up a business and founding his own dynasty. Lumberjack's Dynasty is a unique mix of forestry, logging and life simulation combined with role playing elements. You start at a run-down logger camp which you slowly take over from your aunt and uncle to bring it back to its former glory. Besides the pure “lumberjacking” you can solve a large variety of quests and train many skills to become better and more professional along the way. You can always and freely adapt your way of playing: Either quickly become a straightforward and professional lumberjack by purchasing, cutting and converting large forests into products – and, thereby – into your economic success without getting sidetracked too much. Alternatively, you can take more time to explore the full depth of the game and also let yourself experience the vast variety of additional possibilities - ranging from repairing and renovating your buildings and vehicles, over fishing, making honey, and growing vegetables to socializing with local folks, finding the love of your life and eventually founding your own family. Either way, a lot of fun (and hard work) is waiting for you while taking care of your life while growing your company and transforming both into a successful Lumberjack’s Dynasty. Features • Unique mix of forestry, logging and life simulation in first person view • Quest driven story line • Large, open world • Plenty of individual characters to interact with • Adaptable gameplay with huge variety of tasks • Skill system – learn and improve your skills to become better and more efficient • Economic system with different products and varying prices • Control heavy machinery and vehicles • Manufacture and sell logs, planks, bark and other wooden products • Repair, rebuild and expand your home and other buildings • Repair and work on specific vehicles • Take a rest from your lumberjacking and follow other activities such as fishing, growing vegetables, collecting fruit, making honey and cooking delicious meals • Earn social points and money as (partially interchangeable) currencies to further expand and develop your business • Find a wife and raise a family • Grow your Lumberjack’s Dynasty by making the right decisions","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/0607/PNqIKutXZfpFBCc3mHQbOLKR.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3550-CUSA32418_00-LUMBERJACKSDYNEU","60%","0","Simulation, Role Playing Games","314.7","null","null","Lumberjack's Dynasty","TRD","Toplitz Productions","2022-06-30","lumberjacks-dynasty-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","419.60","1","",

But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they’d ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she’s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can’t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years. While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she’s felt before.

"","2024-08-28","Maddie Raines has had enough. After years of serving as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with her own life. But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they’d ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she’s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can’t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years. While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she’s felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail’s death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202201/1802/YjVGmuGKJwCLYgAT5TIV2qur.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0734-CUSA27440_00-7651601550296662","30%","0","Adventure","357","null","null","Heart of the Woods","TRD","SEKAI PROJECT, INC","2022-02-14","heart-of-the-woods-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","595.00","0","416.50","1","",

The Ultimate Edition contains: Dying Light 2 Stay Human Exclusive Weapon Charms Legendary Equipment Digital Comic & Wallpapers Digital Artbook & Soundtrack Story DLC 1: Bloody Ties Access to Story DLC 2 Consumable items It’s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE DEAD Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/2908/HSg5GbvwYMeUj770IcWrHmsi.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-ULTIMATEEDITIOEU","30%","0","Unique","1574.3","null","null","Dying Light 2 Stay Human – Ultimate Edition","TRD","TECHLAND SP.

In Airport Simulator: Day & Night, your challenge is to keep the wheel turning and ensure that everything in the airport runs smoothly around the clock. Firstly, you will need to take care of fleet and baggage management to handle transporting passengers and the ever-increasing number of aircraft from various airlines. In addition, security checks, airport hygiene and maintenance are also crucial and need to be well managed. Depending on the time of day and weather conditions, your tasks will vary.

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/oiWObCmIi2HWJ2AUnHfc7P7a.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCODELUXE000000","85%","0","Action, Adventure","314.85","null","null","Sherlock Holmes Chapter One Deluxe Edition","TRD","FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","2021-11-15","sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","314.85","1","",

"","2024-08-28","Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again is a dynamic platformer with the elements of a rogue-lite, a combo system and special moves. The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won’t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King’s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter’s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King’s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose. • The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty. As you progress, you'll come across Easter eggs, things that’ll crack you up and allusions to other games coupled with self-mockery • Randomly generated locations of items, artifacts, traps, rooms in the building, enemies and bosses • 12 characters, all with different performance and equipment • Customized equipment which can be upgraded with rocks, runes and enchantments • Secret features and tricks (e.g. get a firesword by plunging your sword into the lava) • Jaw-dropping action with various moves, skills and spells!","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/1314/p9Xoj3zDWsHsxVd3qyJsR5SE.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5506-CUSA29830_00-PLPA000000000000","69%","0","Role Playing Games, Action","25.12","null","null","Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again","TRD","BIG WAY LLC","2021-10-26","princesslootpixelagain-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","157.00","0","48.67","1","",

But above everything else: defend the Mainframe! • RETRO STYLE: Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack. • DIVERSE TACTICS: Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets, eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind. • BUILD YOUR SQUAD: Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in MAINFRAME DEFENDERS you have to combine different items with unique abilities, to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build! • UNIQUE ENEMIES: Enemy squad won't sit idle, though. Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you will lose. • PROCEDURAL LEVELS: Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk falling behind? • PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Victory or defeat, the game is not over yet! Unlock new units, each with a unique set of upgrades and load-outs. Unlock new items to bolster your new strategies.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/0810/jnRXs6yqjBKuk5K3bb9q54ap.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5506-CUSA28328_00-MAINFRAMEDEFEND0","69%","0","Strategy, Strategy","55.84","null","null","Mainframe Defenders","TRD","BIG WAY LLC","2021-10-21","mainframe-defenders-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","108.19","1","",
"","2024-08-28","Inspector Waffles was hoping his worst days were behind him, but the murder of a high-profile industrialist CEO beloved by the citizens of Cat Town raises new questions and fears. Being the best inspector on the CTPD, Waffles has no choice: he's gotta push past the painful memories, don his well-worn overcoat, and prepare to get his paws dirty. A detective story reminiscent of the old school classics, Inspector Waffles provides plenty of peculiar mystery, a story full of intrigue, and a slew of characters to interrogate, all wrapped into beautifully simple pixel-art. Will you be able to sniff out every clue and nab the murderer? A REAL TREAT, SEE? * A brilliant feline detective in a world full of anthropomorphic cats, dogs, and maybe other species.

"","2024-08-28","You play the role of captain Ashley S. Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls ""Mr. Riggs"", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You’re the only human there, after all. SURVIVAL Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game – including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™’s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0114/xvUwYjctSRFXETMYPdfkwDUc.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4380-PPSA03754_00-3110489674172889","45%","0","Action, Strategy","472.05","null","null","The Riftbreaker","TRD","Exor Studios","2021-10-13","the-riftbreaker-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","0","576.95","0","",

In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.

DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal.

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

"","2024-08-28","Order of Battle: World War II is a turn-based strategy game with an impressive variety of scenarios and theatres of war. Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders – split between Generals, Pilots and Captains – is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow. FEATURES Classic turn based, hex based gameplay with an intuitive UI and great depth. Play in dynamic campaigns with unit carryover and multiple ""what-if"" scenarios. A rich 3D world with detailed animations and effects 20 different Specializations give a unique feel to each faction including Banzai Charge, Bushido Code and even the Manhattan Project. Over a thousand different unit types, including infantry, tanks, ships and aircraft, each with unique visuals and animations Attach unique commanders to your units to give them additional offensive and defensive bonuses A deep but intuitive supply system allowing breakthroughs & encirclements.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1812/6vfDdBCOEsxM7cwPshdYlmYB.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4136-CUSA14680_00-OOBWWII000000001","80%","0","Strategy","139.8","null","null","Order of Battle: World War II","TRD","Slitherine","2021-08-19","order-of-battle-world-war-ii-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","139.80","1","",

You will have to withstand freezing weather and nasty bear intrigues while slurping condensed milk to survive and adapt to the rapidly changing environment. Full immersion in the dramatic atmosphere of the Cold War. These are the times when duty to your country is more important than your own opinion. Even your mortal body belongs to the State. Only under such conditions can people truly become real heroes and patriots of their homeland. Do not let Mother Russia be ruined! Do or die! Death itself is not a good enough excuse for a Soviet man! • Enhance the capabilities of Boris's body which helps him work better. Although Boris is physically fit, there is always room for improvement! • The enemy never sleeps, and he’s incredibly cunning. Watch out for a continuous hailstorm of all kinds of high-tech junk and lethal nuclear explosives. • Distill a vital potion! The only thing that can stop a bear is a bottle of VODA! Stock up on a few bottles for yourself and your new Siberian friend. • This will at least make your enemy respect you or at most silence him forever. Give it up for ""STEPAN"" – an intercontinental ballistic missile, an engineering marvel and a hellish combination of power and splendor. • Got tired of OST? Or would you rather listen to something from your own audio collection? Specially for you, music fans, we present an in-game audio-player.

Countless heroes have tried and failed to destroy the ancient spell that holds the castle walls. Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside, guarding the sword shards — the last known thing to be capable of defeating the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure. Although you are not alone — some help could be obtained from the merchants, who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them to disappear... Plan your every step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option. There are two difficulty modes: PAL/NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch. Just like in old NES games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found… Features: - Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming. - Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock. - Randomly generated castle, 216 rooms to overcome. - Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/0516/PR3tOOkXXc9G7Zs8zewJEI9o.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5645-CUSA26567_00-00ZOLOTAYACHASHA","50%","0","Role-Playing","24.5","null","null","Castle of no Escape 2","TRD","Xitilon","2021-03-13","castle-of-no-escape-2-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","245.00","0","122.50","1","",

Includes over 189 bizarre illnesses, a huge array of cure machines bursting with personality, and loads and loads of items to place in your hospitals! Includes: Bigfoot, Pebberley Island, Close Encounters and Off the Grid full expansions, plus the Retro Items Pack and Exhibition Items Pack. About Two Point Hospital Build, cure and improve! Design and build your own hospital! Build up a hospital from nothing to a masterpiece as you design the most beautiful – or functional – healthcare operation in the whole of Two Point County. Optimise your hospital design to increase patient (and cash) flow, arranging corridors, rooms and waiting areas to your exact specifications. Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible. Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in. Cure unusual illnesses! Don’t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, you’ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism – each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine. Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. Once you’ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut. Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next?","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/2408/InXOJ4ylvUFlnCm3WV8WhloN.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0177-CUSA15884_00-4800564551767910","80%","0","Simulation","0","null","null","Two Point Hospital: JUMBO Edition","TRD","SEGA EUROPE LTD","2021-03-05","two-point-hospital-jumbo-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","999.00","0","199.80","1","1",

WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects’ minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion. But remember, no matter how deep you go, you can never hide from an Observer.","2024-08-13","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4176-PPSA02117_00-8201964206903574","60%","0","Horror","0","null","null","Observer: System Redux","TRD","BLOOBER TEAM S.A.","2020-11-11","observer-system-redux-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","0","419.60","1","",

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before! NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them! EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...) There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor.

Up to 10 players can simultaneously fight in the Hexadiums, scenarios that are divided into 6 zones, each with its own gravity, different platforms, hideouts and open spaces, that turn them into a frenetic battlefield. In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle. This way, heroes will be an extension of each player’s style, creating an unique gameplay with hundreds of combinations.

"","2024-08-28","Daydreamer: Awakened Edition is the story of the last human who rouses from an eternal sleep to an unfamiliar Earth. Aliens took over the planet thousands of years ago, and the nameless protagonist was kept in a stasis chamber as a twisted relic to memorialize their victory. However, the mysterious Immortal Gate Keeper liberates her and sets her on a dangerous expedition to the Earth’s core. Be warned though—the aliens will do whatever it takes to get their trophy back, and the Earth is filled with frightening creatures that hunger for human flesh. Shoot your way through the hauntingly beautiful remains of Earth. Created by Roland Studios, a one-man indie development house, Daydreamer is a homage to 16-bit era side-scrolling shooters. Coupled with strategic platforming, high intensity battles, and pets that aid in combat, you wouldn’t want to wake up from this dream.
