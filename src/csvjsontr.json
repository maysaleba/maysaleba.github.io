It tells the story of a young nun who sets off on a journey of self-discovery with the most unusual, horn-headed companion by her side. On the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance\u2014as she speaks with the devil himself. Indika\u2019s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery. The world she discovers can only be described as a wild combination of comedy and tragedy straight out of the novels by Dostoyevski and Bulhakov. ENJOY AN INDIE GAME WHERE EVERYTHING GOES The subjects of religion and authority are prevalent throughout Indika\u2019s journey and she\u2019ll be faced with many questions along the way. Guide her to find the answers one by one before she can finish her life-defining odyssey. Odd Meter is a small, independent studio formerly based in Moscow and now operating out of Kazakhstan. Its members put aesthetics at the forefront and aren\u2019t afraid to tread the fine line of ethical norms. Their game is a great testament to that, as INDIKA constitutes an open challenge to the industry's established approach to creating video games.","SaleStarted":"2024-07-02","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202310\/1114\/2ab11b93f3b922d21a0c77af4baf962952e4e4d4ac775641.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP4361-PPSA16214_00-0000000000INDIKA","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":5,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP4361-PPSA16214_00-0000000000INDIKA","PlusPrice":503.2,"Title":"INDIKA","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"11 Bit Studios S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2024-05-17","Slug":"indika-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":4,"SalePrice":"503.20","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-07-17","LowestPrice":"","description":"Blast Frenzy is an exciting ball matching game. -Filled with 40 different levels, the game offers players eye-catching graphics and addictive gameplay. -Get higher scores and complete the levels by creating chain reactions. -The difficulty level increases with each level, which keeps the game constantly exciting. -Simple yet addictive, Blast Frenzy offers an experience that players of all ages will enjoy.

Your kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner. Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen. And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter. A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests.

Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world.

Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. The more the merrier\u2026 You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable. Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.

In this dark fantasy adventure you solve intricate cases and unveil abysmal secrets as Inquisitor Mordimer Madderdin. The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500\u2019s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal \u2018the truth\u2019. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it\u2019s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation. Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy\u2019s weak points against them.","SaleStarted":"2024-07-02","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202311\/0813\/6c0abbadb6ee8ae04ec8ba8c2b225bedacea0bd6a8733cd9.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP4365-PPSA10961_00-0THEINQUISITORDX","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP4365-PPSA10961_00-0THEINQUISITORDX","PlusPrice":719.2,"Title":"The Inquisitor - Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Kalypso Media GMBH","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-08","Slug":"the-inquisitor-deluxe-edition-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"899.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"719.20","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-07-17","LowestPrice":"","description":"An ultra-realistic surfing simulation with stunning graphics and complex physics.

How did we achieve that?

Check their stats and resistances, then place the best traps and monsters to defeat them! When you think your dungeon is ready, let the crawl begin! You will then be able to watch those heroes die! It's a reversed dungeon crawler: heroes will move through your dungeon and will trigger the traps you placed.

Do you want to focus on sheer destruction or are you into a more subtle puppetmaster approach? You can experiment by combining destructive spells. The easiest way to wipe out villagers is to simply cast powerful spells like Earthquakes, Lightning and more. But what happens when you hurl a meteor at a poisonous puddle? Poisonous meteor explosions, that's what! And that's just one of the many nefarious ways that you can combine elemental interactions. You can afflict villagers with flaws. Sure, you could just destroy the world with ice and fire, but the real fun begins when you meddle with villager lives to put them into compelling and tragic situations! Afflict an annoying husband with Unfaithfulness and then watch the fireworks once you tell his wife of his misdeeds. You can spawn monsters to kidnap and harass villagers. You can snatch or seize a roaming monster and then breed it in your Kennel. This will allow you to summon them as part of your monster parties.
