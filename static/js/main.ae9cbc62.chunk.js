When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself!

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.

Barely.<br /><br />Take on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents.<br /><br />You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it\'s heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.<br /><br />During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands.<br /><br />If you\'re lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.<br /><br />You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode.<br /><br />Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you\'re wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.<br /><br />In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.<br /><br />If you can survive long enough to find it.","genre":"Role-Playing,Strategy","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202009/3014/Duaw5GDGGTUKSB17we8CzRfZ.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/7332/stellaris-console-edition--deluxe-edition-playstation","PercentOff":"75%","PlusPrice":14.99,"Price":59.99,"Publisher":"Paradox Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2019-02-26","SCORE":"80","SaleEnds":"2021-10-28 06:59:00","SalePrice":14.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-13 08:10:39","Slug":"stellaris-console-edition--deluxe-edition-playstation","Title":"Stellaris: Console Edition - Deluxe Edition","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4139-CUSA07740_00-STELLARISDDEUS01","description":"Save money on content for this game by purchasing the Season Pass.

Your pizza\'s here!\' You announce. No one answers. There\'s an eerie silence.<br /><br />You are getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the door and look around. The front door suddenly closes behind you.<br /><br />You just wanted to finish this last delivery and head home for the night. Now you must figure out how to get out of this stupid creepy house.<br /><br />Freely roam the house and try to figure out what is going on. Three dolls and a strange girl named Emily will also start roaming the house as the hours toll by. Stay away from them, but if you do end up in a room with one, figure out how to stay alive.<br /><br />This may be your last pizza delivery.<br /><br />(c) 2016 SKH Apps LLC All Rights Reserved","genre":"Action","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP0994/CUSA12205_00/5YiLgnyvzjcAY6xyzQxBiavsX8LdDcXC.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/3536/halloween-forever-playstation","PercentOff":"45%","PlusPrice":5.49,"Price":9.99,"Publisher":"POPPY WORKS.","ReleaseDate":"2018-10-22","SCORE":"75","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":5.49,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 07:11:09","Slug":"halloween-forever-playstation","Title":"Halloween Forever","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0994-CUSA12205_00-HALLOWEENFOREVNA","description":"Adventure through three weird, spooky worlds in search of your destiny.

Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages.<br /><br />The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible.<br /><br />Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.<br /><br />As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.<br /><br />A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game\'s atmosphere.","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307J23gLIGDXjcPQkNP_BIOzsJkH2aXIu15z_wiyX5Q2jAIPwjcec4P7kCbPo7PR1vyK9uwTJONCj9s8-nkqWLMIsn_89T.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/spookys-jump-scare-mansion-hd-renovation-playstation","PercentOff":"33%","PlusPrice":6.69,"Price":9.99,"Publisher":"ALBINO MOOSE GAMES","ReleaseDate":"2019-10-29","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":6.69,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 08:10:40","Slug":"spookys-jump-scare-mansion-hd-renovation-playstation","Title":"Spooky\'s Jump Scare Mansion: HD Renovation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4388-CUSA10521_00-0000000000000000","description":"Can you survive 1000 rooms of cute terror?

You\'ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn\'t even bear imagining.<br /><br />Storyline<br />This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\'ll soon wish you could join the dead\'s ranks in their abyss, but death won\'t help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows?<br /><br />Dark entities<br />The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\'ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own.<br /><br />Gameplay<br />In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You\'ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it.<br /><br />Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you\'ll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Teen","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307TQRuBkpEMNOSz7zNpepxSnIwkP0iamqNnaacfTfBj7kFSUyAe-ROlMIOT8n7IMm9wjySg0gTBeQ--gWxbG3Mssn8pXS.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/waltz-of-the-wizard-extended-edition-playstation","PercentOff":"60%","PlusPrice":3.99,"Price":9.99,"Publisher":"Aldin Dynamics, ehf.","ReleaseDate":"2019-08-27","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":3.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 07:10:53","Slug":"waltz-of-the-wizard-extended-edition-playstation","Title":"Waltz of the Wizard: Extended Edition","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1452-CUSA16931_00-WOTWEE2019PSVR01","description":"Waltz of the Wizard is a virtual reality experience that lets you feel what it is like to have magical powers.
