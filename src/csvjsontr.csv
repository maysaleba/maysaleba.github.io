92,2023-06-21,"From PlayStation Studios and Bluepoint Games comes a remake of the PlayStation classic, Demon's Souls. Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who've faced its trials and tribulations before can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance. In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant, channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One. With the summoning of The Old One, a colourless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them lost their minds — left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained. Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title Slayer of Demons and send The Old One back to its slumber.",2023-06-06,/game/2439,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1717/GemRaOZaCMhGxQ9dRhnQQyT5.png?w=200,28,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP9000-PPSA01341_00-DEMONSSOULS00000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TMs2E6cms4,25%,75,Action,0,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1717/GemRaOZaCMhGxQ9dRhnQQyT5.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/demons-souls,Demon's Souls,TRD,Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe,2020-11-11,demons-souls-ps5-tr,https://shope.ee/2fgQ1uSp5J,1,619,42,464.25,0

Set in late 19th century Japan and London, each title features five murder-mystery episodes filled with all the drama, laughs, twists and “turnabouts” you’ve come to expect from the legally labyrinthine legacy of Ace Attorney. Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you! In the course of each case, you’ll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimony, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn’t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn’t shout “OBJECTION!” when you know you’ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution’s claims and prove your client’s innocence.

70,2023-06-21,"The town of Moonbury has always been wary of the advances of the outside world, preferring to rely on their traditional methods of healing. Until one day, when the mayor's daughter falls ill, and the local witch doctor can do nothing to help her, they are forced to look outside their small community for help. The Medical Association decides to send their most accomplished chemist - you - to help cure the mayor's daughter and convince the residents of Moonbury of the wonders of modern alchemy. Gain their trust and tend to each person when they fall ill in this open-ended sim RPG. Take care of residents. Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed. Diagnose symptoms and find a cure! Hmm... a low heart rate and a bloated liver. Shoulder cramps, perhaps? No, these are sure signs of burning lungs. This patient has been consuming too much gelatin! Easily remedied; you'll just need to craft some Minty Goblet. Gather ingredients out in the world. Once you've decided on a potion, ointment, or salve, gather ingredients from the surrounding environment using your tools. Upgrade your hammer, axe, and sickle for new swings and attacks to help with your day-to-day tasks. Watch out for changing weather conditions! You may find yourself caught out in the rain, a freezing blizzard, or even the baking heat of a desert. Confront nasty monsters for their materials. Sometimes you won't be able to gather the materials you need as easily as harvesting a berry bush, and you'll need to turn your trusty tools into weapons to collect materials from the monsters prowling the nearby wilderness. Combat is in real-time and, since you're a chemist, you'll be able to brew various concoctions to buff yourself or inflict status ailments on your adversaries, as well as various tools to aid you. Brew remedies in your cauldron. The ingredients you gather can be mixed in your cauldron to brew medicine, vitamins, and more. As you become more experienced, higher-level recipes will become available, requiring more ingredients but bestowing stronger effects. Enhance your cauldron to concoct more ingredients into your recipes for these more advanced remedies. Build relationships with the townsfolk. It'll take a little while, but your patients' health will be much better thanks to your efforts. Your reputation with them will increase, and they'll open up to you a little more. You may even find yourself growing particularly close to certain bachelors or bachelorettes. Upgrade the town and surrounding areas. Building relationships with townsfolk increases your approval rating, allowing you to improve public buildings and expanding the explorable areas around the town. You can also craft and buy new furniture to give your home a personal touch! Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. In the downtime between treating the community's ailments, you'll be able to freely explore in and around Moonbury. Get to know the inhabitants a little better, take a rest in the tavern, or go fishing to catch something for dinner. Moonbury is a delightfully charming location where time seems a little slower and life is just a little more relaxed than the big city. While the lighting will change throughout the day, with the bright sun streaking across the meadows in the morning and street lamps illuminating the town in the early evening, there are no time limits for game objectives. Spend time with a faithful companion. You didn't relocate to Moonbury alone! With you every step of the way is your loyal dog companion. Your pet can help you locate hidden items and point you in the direction of residents as they go about their day.",2023-06-06,/game/85618,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1514/macP3Eb2PKvBNNY2LhFNlzFx.png?w=200,24,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4293-PPSA02687_00-POTIONPERMITSIEE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WvP403k63A,15%,29,Role-Playing,139.3,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1514/macP3Eb2PKvBNNY2LhFNlzFx.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/potion-permit,Potion Permit,TRD,PQube Ltd,2022-09-21,potion-permit-ps4&ps5-tr,https://shope.ee/5V0bOGClxm,1,199,28,169.15,1

69,2023-06-21,"Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes. Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled—this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these—and more—to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience—a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!",2023-06-06,/game/87808,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200,5,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0102-CUSA24163_00-MAKAIRE000000001,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F177-VTSGSM,25%,11,Action,149.5,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection,Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection,TRD,CE EUROPE LIMITED,2021-05-31,ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-ps4-tr,https://shope.ee/40Bnc4UoOP,0,299,6,224.25,1

68,2023-06-21,"Daydreamer: Awakened Edition is the story of the last human who rouses from an eternal sleep to an unfamiliar Earth. Aliens took over the planet thousands of years ago, and the nameless protagonist was kept in a stasis chamber as a twisted relic to memorialize their victory. However, the mysterious Immortal Gate Keeper liberates her and sets her on a dangerous expedition to the Earth’s core. Be warned though—the aliens will do whatever it takes to get their trophy back, and the Earth is filled with frightening creatures that hunger for human flesh. Shoot your way through the hauntingly beautiful remains of Earth. Created by Roland Studios, a one-man indie development house, Daydreamer is a homage to 16-bit era side-scrolling shooters. Coupled with strategic platforming, high intensity battles, and pets that aid in combat, you wouldn’t want to wake up from this dream.

The following excerpt was retrieved from the short story “Cobra da Várzea”, published in a clandestine local paper from Salvador (Bahia), United States of Brazil (Typewritten translation attached) It's three after midnight, and the only light for leagues comes from the small fire she built in the sand. She works a knife with steady, agile fingers and carefully carves out her prize. When it gives in, it is with a wet sound, and she closes her hand around it like an embrace. At her feet, four men protest in muffled whimpers, facing the night with bleeding holes where they once had eyes. When the fishermen find them, they will be dressed in white by the waves of the Atlantic, awaiting final judgment for sins the courts of men had swiftly forgiven. By then, she will be long gone. “It's Biatatá’s doing.” The hushed whispers will spread through the streets and the pews. Some will call her a hero, others a murderer, and the superstitious will insist on the stories of a fiery snake stealing men's eyes and driving them mad. Above all, the people will ask, and the papers will plead, why? Rolling the fresh eyeball in her fingers, she wonders, not for the first time, if she could ever answer. She never believed in justice, and she can't remember the last time she enjoyed revenge. All she remembers is being small and scrawny and invisible in a crowd of too many. Falling and being used as pavement. Bleeding and being left to rot. She asked why many times, and when the answer came to her, it felt like soothing to a burn. Perhaps the reason for one’s evil is simply that one can. And if so, then her own reasons could be just as plain. Not a savior nor a beast. She kills these wretched men because she can, and others won't. She throws the eye into the flames and takes a deep breath before smiling. Tomorrow, she travels North to colder lands, on the trail of worse evils and tougher choices. But tonight, the salty air of Salvador warms her skin, and as the men’s cries fade into silence, she knows these dead will not come back.",2023-06-06,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/1519/3b9e564f3dc035e378bb2eaf3e3a0882f6c8291488df0109.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-THEHUNTGAME00051,,15%,,"Shooter, Action, Shooter",69.3,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/1519/3b9e564f3dc035e378bb2eaf3e3a0882f6c8291488df0109.png,,Hunt: Showdown - Biatatá - Still Waters Run Deep,TRD,Crytek Gmbh,2023-03-08,hunt-showdown--biatat--still-waters-run-deep-ps5-tr,,1,99,,84.15,0

Foulest amongst this pantheon is the creature known as Frau Perchta, unsoftened like others of her ilk by the passing of time. A thing made of fur and tusk, fang and terror, who, in form of a woman, slits the abdomen to pull out the innards. A beast that changes from dusk to dawn. Those that stand against corruption, from forgotten valleys to glacial peaks, are made of harder stuff. Stories reached Louisiana of one – one who’d lost themselves amongst the blood in the snow, and who had donned the mantle of Frau Perchta, inhabited the children's tale meant to terrify. The daughter of a peasant high in the mountains, all that remains of that life are half-forgotten memories of taking the cattle to graze. In midwinter, a father returning home at dusk, a silver coin promised to a good daughter wasted on drink, a hand raised to a protesting mother. A hand raised one too many times. When the sun rose at dawn, a corpse was found with its abdomen slit in two, entrails feasted on by beasts. From Louisiana, Perchta was sent for, and only silence answered. Those who had whispered of Perchta were called fools, and those that believed were laughed out of town. But in the depths of winter, when dawn broke in the bayou, garlands of innards were found strung on trees. The bad faced retribution every dusk.

Discover spectacular new prehistoric species, three new islands, detailed Malta-inspired buildings, and an all-new campaign in Jurassic World Evolution 2: Dominion Malta Expansion. NEW CAMPAIGN EXPERIENCE Before the events of Jurassic World Dominion, help lead a brand new enterprise in Malta. Work alongside Cabot Finch and key figures from the film, including Kayla Watts (voiced by DeWanda Wise), Soyona Santos (voiced by Dichen Lachman), Barry Sembène (voiced by Omar Sy), and Lewis Dodgson (voiced by Campbell Scott) as you set up parks across three Mediterranean locations. Establish key buildings, and trade on the dinosaur exchange to acquire more species, eggs, and even genome data. Work with both the Underground and Authorities and build trust with these organisations via various actions to unlock further opportunities such as, hatchery upgrades, locations and more. NEW LOCATIONS AND BUILDINGS Create all-new parks containing a range of exciting buildings with a film-inspired theme, including the new Acquisition Centre, viewing gallery, hotel, and more. Seat your ranger, MVU, and capture teams in new-style vehicles, and add fresh decorations to make your parks stand out. Build across three new locations set in the Mediterranean, one of which boasts a natural lagoon. All Malta buildings are available to use in sandbox mode. NEW PREHISTORIC SPECIES AND SKINS Host four captivating dinosaurs as seen in Jurassic World Dominion. Faithfully created to mirror their film counterparts, these iconic prehistoric species are ready to give guests an unforgettable experience. Furthermore, Jurassic World Evolution 2: Dominion Malta Expansion features stunning new variants of existing species and additional film skins, so you can give your dinosaurs a bold new look with different patterns and colours. The pack contains: NEW DINOSAURS Atrociraptor (with 4x movie ‘squad’ skins) Arguably even more dangerous than its velociraptor cousins, the Atrociraptor has a bulkier body and boxier snout. The coloration varies wildly between individuals. Lystrosaurus A short, squat herbivore with powerful forelimbs and an unusually shaped skull that lived around 250 million years ago. The Lystrosaurus is notable for its tusks and horned beak, used to bite bits of vegetation. Oviraptor A smaller predator with a distinctive head crest, the Oviraptor has a unique feathered look. Originally believed to steal eggs of other dinosaurs, it was dubbed the ‘Egg Thief’, but it has since been understood to be an omnivore with a powerful jaw for its size. Moros Intrepidus A diminutive carnivore and one of the smallest Tyrannosauroids to have ever existed, the Moros Intrepidus is only a fraction of the size of its famous relative, the T. rex. Despite its short stature, it is known to be a quick and nimble hunter. NEW DINOSAUR VARIANTS inspired by Jurassic World Dominion.

The first time Claeg realized something was wrong was when he went out on an errand for his wife Emma. He kissed her goodbye and mounted his horse to ride into town, but when he blinked once again, he was five miles away from home and his horse lay bleeding from its throat. He walked all the way back home covered in blood to meet the panicked tears of his wife, children, and friends. From then on, it took Claeg every fiber of his being to concentrate even on the smallest task. Doing work on the farm became insurmountable labor, and his children wept in the corners when he mixed up their names and faces. Emma took him to countless doctors who couldn’t give a name to his ailment, but any person of the cloth they met all said the same thing: A demon was slowly taking over Claeg’s body, and he was in dire need of salvation. “The demon is only sated after sacrifice!” The good Christians would wail. “Stop him before it’s too late.” But the time to stop Claeg never came. And when he awoke one day to his friend’s blood upon his throwing axe, his wails of anguish echoed through the town. It was death that brought Claeg back to life, and so Emma brought him to the man in DeSalle who they knew dealt in death. And death he dealt. Waking to become himself only when blood caked his hands, and his prey took their last breath. Countless has to die so that he, in a sense, wouldn’t. So that he remembered the reason he lived this torturous existence. So that he could remember the laughs of his children and the touch of his wife. So that no demon could take his place. Claeg Grey donned the mask and robe not for himself, but for the sake of his family. So that no one would know his true self. So that his loved ones could finally find peace once more.

It is the year 518. The rebellion of the renegade mages, known as the Mage Wars, has been quashed by the Crown.

Apprenticed to the cruel and ambitious alligator hunter Frank Gravel, Cowen earned his keep on the flesh and hide of that primordial prey. Together the two men relished their prosperity, leaving mountains of scale and bone in their wake. But that was before the corruption. That was before something far more threatening, and far more primeval, drove most of the gators away from the swamps, and left Gravel and Cowen high and dry. As the alligators began to disappear, desperation took hold. Broke and without prospects, they eventually tracked down an alligator – one of the few that dared remain. As Gravel punched Tooth to Tail through scale, fat, and flesh, a mist of greed shrouded Cowen’s mind. He plunged Avarice’s blade into Gravel’s throat and watched him bleed out across the gator's carcass. As their blood seeped into the mud, Cowen donned the beast’s skin: a mantel of victory and betrayal.

The CURTAIN CALL Chapter is a Chapter for Dead by Daylight and it includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map. People often speak of the tears of a clown, of the sadness that lies beneath the greasepaint smile.

For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on. Kate Denson’s smile is genuine, friendly and warm. She sings of love and life, family and hope. She holds those values dear, and will fight anyone who tries to destroy them.

,2023-06-21,"Dark times mean fear and risks. The risk to be caught by patrolling National Socialists, looking for people who publicly stand against their point of view. The risk of being beaten up or even killed by the German military because we‘re opposing the regime. The risk of losing everything, including our loved ones. This is how we live. This is how we try to survive. Through the darkest of times. Plan, Act, Survive You are the leader of a small resistance group in 1933’s Berlin, of ordinary people, from Jews to Catholics and Communists to Patriots who simply can’t stand aside. Your goal is to deal with small blows to the regime – dropping leaflets to spread awareness about what the Nazis are really up to among the people, painting messages on walls, sabotaging, gathering information and recruiting more followers. And all of that while staying undercover – if the regime’s forces learn about your group, the life of each member is in grave danger. Experience history Through the Darkest of Times is a historical resistance strategy game, focusing on conveying the somber mood of the period and the very real struggles of average people living in the 3rd Reich. Historical accuracy means that your small group of resistance fighters will not change the outcome of the war, nor will you prevent all of the Nazi’s atrocities, but you can certainly do everything in your power to save as many lives as you can and oppose the fascist system wherever possible.
