In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness.

Create energy shields and deliver powerful spirit blasts to survive the spirit world and its otherworldly dangers. SEE WHAT\u2019S HIDDEN Delve deep into a mature and morally ambiguous story, where nothing is what it seems and everything has another side. As a medium you see, hear and experience more than others, and with every new perspective you will change your perception on what happened at the Niwa resort. PLAY IN TWO WORLDS AT THE SAME TIME Never-seen-before gameplay that plays out across two worlds displayed at the same time. Explore the physical world and the spirit world simultaneously, and use the interactions between them to solve dual-reality puzzles, unlock new paths, and awaken memories of past events. ENTER A DARK REALITY INSPIRED BY BEKSIŃSKI The Medium\u2019s spirit world is a dark mirror reflection of our reality, a grim and unsettling place where our unpunished deeds, evil urges, and vile secrets manifest themselves and can take on a form. This world has been invented and designed under the inspiration of Zdzisław Beksiński\u2019s paintings, Polish dystopian surrealist internationally recognized for his distinctive and strikingly ominous style. MUSIC BY YAMAOKA & REIKOWSKI Immerse yourself in the disturbing and oppressive atmosphere of the game thanks to the original \u2018dual\u2019 soundtrack co-created by Akira Yamaoka and Arkadiusz Reikowski. Yamaoka-san is a legendary Japanese composer best known for his work on the Silent Hill series; Reikowski is a Hollywood Music in Media Awards nominee who worked on such acclaimed horror games as Blair Witch, Layers of Fear, and Observer. Now they join their creative forces for the music and songs of The Medium.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/78037","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1813/DV0IXPHtc7JRTLoxsKAg0sJh.png?w=200","MainStory":8,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4176-PPSA03718_00-5144890209675501","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTAz758Vt88","PercentOff":"22%","Completionist":9,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1813/DV0IXPHtc7JRTLoxsKAg0sJh.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/the-medium","Title":"The Medium","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BLOOBER TEAM S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-02","Slug":"the-medium-ps5-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/1q9SR7nLuM","IsPS5":1,"Price":439,"MainExtra":8,"SalePrice":342.42,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"75","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"The PIRATE WARRIORS series has successfully combined the popular anime ONE PIECE with the thrilling action of the WARRIORS series to create a worldwide phenomenon selling more than four million copies!

As you guide Gaia\u2019s light through it and discover the causes behind the destruction, you will learn the fate of the Devourers as agents of extinction, but also agents of progress, love, and hope.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/118233","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202304/0312/293739904a7a7ce07856d5e3324f6e3dcd1e3602fb442425.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4829-PPSA07949_00-AFUS00000000SIEE","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4ly0NRLaLU","PercentOff":"17%","Completionist":11,"genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":362.34,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202304/0312/293739904a7a7ce07856d5e3324f6e3dcd1e3602fb442425.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/after-us","Title":"After Us","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE UK","ReleaseDate":"2023-05-23","Slug":"after-us-ps5-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/7pQfVQDHwO","IsPS5":1,"Price":549,"MainExtra":8,"SalePrice":455.67,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"66","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

Watch visitors pay respect or family members squabble as you pass judgment in royal audiences, establishing the vital link between your people and your realm.

Step into a fully 3D realized space, available in one of four major cultural visual styles, and fill it with regalia and majesty. ● Harsh or benevolent, pass judgment on those seeking arbitration.

He progresses on his journey, raiding trading convoys, upgrading the ships and, of course, always keeping an eye on the morale of the crew. While doing so, he tries to persuade fellow pirate captains to join his fleet, all with with their own ships and individual abilities. With even bigger prizes in his sights, he will not stop until he is undisputedly the greatest pirate of the Caribbean. BECOME THE PIRATE OF ALL PIRATES \u2022 You are not born a great pirate, but we give you the tools to make you THE great pirate. Customize your own Flag under which your fleet will sail. As you gain experience, your notoriety and skills will improve. Roleplay with more than 35 distinct pirate\u2019s skills on your way to claim your pirate throne.

Take action to relieve the Spanish, Dutch, French and English colonies from their burden of drowning in riches. But be wary! Unless you are sure you are the biggest fish in the sea, don\u2019t venture out too early or too far from your trusted hometown port. ENGAGE IN TACTICAL NAVAL BATTLES \u2022 A ship is safe in a harbor, but that\u2019s not what ships are made for. Fight in tactical turn-based naval battles on a hexagonal grid of epic proportions.

UPGRADE YOUR FLEET \u2022 It is your job to maintain and upkeep a formidable fleet before facing the cannon hail of those mighty warships lurking in the seas. Combining distinct upgrades of your ship\u2019s basic gear, such as weaponry, hull, mast, or figurehead allows for more than 360 unique loadouts. MEET YOUR CREW\u2019S NEEDS \u2022 As an elected captain of the ship, it is your responsibility to split the spoils and riches with your crew. Agreeing on so-called \u2018articles of capture\u2019 clearly define the objectives you embark on before leaving port. Remember the whispers of mutiny below the decks can lead to nasty outcome. After all, you are an elected captain and not placed by the grace of the Lord. PARLEY WITH INFAMOUS PIRATE LEGENDS \u2022 On your journey to become the most fearsome, most glorious pirate captain, you will have the opportunity to get to know several historic pirates. Choose your foes and companions wisely\u2026 COMMAND HISTORICAL SHIPS \u2022 Featuring 18 unique types of ships such as Ship of the Line, Frigate, War Galleon and many more.

Governors and fellow pirate companion provide you with valuable questlines where a few doubloons can be made. Also don\u2019t forget to seek out the local tavern and eavesdrop on the latest rumors.

Ever. This bundle contains SUPERHOT - the award-winning first-person shooter in which time moves only when you move, SUPERHOT VR - the absolute must-play staple of virtual reality, and SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE \u2013 the followup non-VR title painstakingly created over three years of grueling production to satisfy your intense need for more SUPERHOT. Getting all games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT\u2019s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem. Immerse yourself in the brutalist, concrete world of SUPERHOT. Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world. You can be truly free. SUPERHOT Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets. SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT\u2019s signature power fantasy. You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they\u2019re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched. Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel. You take a moment to consider. You\u2019ve been here before. So many times. Maybe this time it will actually mean something. SUPERHOT VR Decisive winner of dozens of VR Game of the Year awards, SUPERHOT VR is a title reimagined and redesigned from the ground up for VR and hand tracking controllers. The fruit of over three years of close cooperation between the critically acclaimed SUPERHOT Team and Oculus, SUPERHOT VR brings the intensely visceral action of SUPERHOT directly into your head and soul. And now \u2013 directly into your VR headset too. The game will test your limits. It will bring pain \u2013 of the good kind. In the end you will prevail. You will be one with the system.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2477-CUSA18510_00-7827683902308671","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":359.6,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"THE COMPLETE SUPERHOT BUNDLE","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Superhot","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-16","Slug":"the-complete-superhot-bundle-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":899,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":629.3,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"The Silent Hill Edition of Dead by Daylight includes the base game, two original add-ons (The Curtain Call Chapter and the Shattered Bloodline Chapter), the Silent Hill Chapter, the Alissa Gillespie outfit for Cheryl Mason and the Dark Wish outfit for The Executioner.
