The inhabitants of this African apocalyptic world will help or hinder you as you make new discoveries and navigate the spectacular landscape. Negotiate your passage with local leaders, healers and warriors, or find yourself embroiled in a battle against nanite swarms, enormous scorpions and rocket-equipped robots. From thriving villages to crumbling cities, petrified forests and bone-dry ocean beds, this strange new world holds a multitude of terrains to uncover, beautifully rendered in 2D isometric art. Explore, solve puzzles and be prepared to face many tough choices that will shape this land long after you complete your journey. UNFORGETTABLE FACES Humanity as you know it has been totally reforged, and that is most evident by the characters in BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION. Technology and mortality have become blurred. Sentient religious robots run rife. Trans-humanistic tribes and leaders have emerged to claim power, and ruthless hunter mercenaries roam the plains. All have adapted to this powerful unknown, and are often at odds with each other. Meet and interact with over forty unique characters, each fully voiced by African voice actors, with thousands of lines of dialogue and multiple conversation paths.

There was no indication of the upcoming tragedy. The Company engaged in construction of houses, wants to take over the forest and cut it out completely, depriving animals of their natural home, and build blocks of flats. Animals are not too happy. Someone wants to evict them without leaving anything in return. Everyoneis panicking! They don\'t know what to do! Is there someone who can help them? It seems that there\'s one animal that didn\'t show any sign of fear ... it\'s SuperMoose. But not because he is so brave, he just went asleep and missed the whole ruckus. Now he has to stop people before they damage the forest. Animals cannot lose their natural environment. All hope lies in the hands (or hooves) of SuperMoose...

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn\'t required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don\'t worry if you don\'t know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"1.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8Vlv9L9VM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"3","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.80","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"32.40","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"7.60","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"19.99","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-16","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-25","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

From memories of homes and streets to surreal visions of imaginary places, Promesa is a contemplative experience about what happens when we\u2019re left dreaming of the things we haven\u2019t lived firsthand. - A slow and relaxing experience focused on contemplative exploration. - Every playthrough (of approximately 45 minutes) is different and it takes more than one to see all the scenes. - A distinct visual style that mixes pixel graphics with high-def light. - Visit dreamlike environments inspired by Argentinian and Italian cities. - A personal project born after a few conversations I had with my grandfather and made by a small team of 4 people. - An acoustic soundtrack that uses many different instruments: from piano and double-bass, to zither and harmonium.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Promesa_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/promesa-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"1","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"1","genre":"Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7.5","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Promesa.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"90","BrazilPrice":"17.81","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Promesa","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Fantastico Studio","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-25","Slug":"promesa-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"20","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"71.61","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"3.49"},{"CanadaPrice":"4.28","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-15","LowestPrice":"3.39","SaleStarted":"2022-04-24","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

This romance adventure game is set in Akihabara, where you\'ll enjoy your new, slightly naughty roommate life with laughter, tears, and the friendship of two female ninja. A young man is dazing off while working the night shift at a convenience store, when a girl stops in to ask for a meat bun. The one next to her appears to be her boyfriend, and after doing their shopping, the two of them link arms affectionately and take off. Just when the young man is thinking how nice it would be to have a girlfriend, a pair of girls in ninja cosplay show up. The girls just stare at the shop goods without buying anything in particular. Even worse, they\'re even chatting about ninja techniques or something along those lines. When he calls out to them to prevent theft, it becomes apparent that they have no money. Despite suspecting that they might try to steal something, he gives in and buys a bento for the two desperately pleading girls.

As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes.

Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley\'s Mecha-suit, which she calls \\"Mr. Riggs\\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.<br />CAMPAIGN<br />Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet.

It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission.<br />EXPLORATION<br />Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology.<br />CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY<br />The Riftbreaker\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings.

In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming 8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he takes on hordes of zombies let loose upon the world.<br /><br />Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne.  Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.<br /><br />Protect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic\'s epic story.<br /><br />The Escapists. \xa9 2015.

In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect.<br /><br />In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character\'s special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online!<br /><br />Featuring<br /><br />Up to 4 players: Play locally AND online with up to 4 players.<br /><br />Easy to pick up, hard to master gameplay: Start off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts.<br /><br />Tons of unlockable extras and secrets: Unlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure.<br /><br />Play on your own: Step up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City.<br /><br />Modes and options:Pick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley...<br /><br />Wicked Tracks: A Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Reptile Games V.O.F.","ReleaseDate":"2019-07-12","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307ELlaYoNnN2QdMDYZi72KXbx4CIwyMygCWFO04DsKQecY8C-QCukNoIAiVTJQr_YTgbIDbONcVucomRUQey8kRgm18kP.png?w=200","Slug":"lethal-league-blaze-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2557-CUSA13507_00-LLBLAZE000000000","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGj8lPwOeKg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"30%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Action,Sports","SalePrice":13.99,"PlusPrice":11.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"89","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/12579/danganronpa-v3-killing-harmony-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-05-12 06:59:00","Title":"Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-04-27 08:12:40","description":"Welcome to a new world of Danganronpa, and prepare yourself for the biggest, most exhilarating episode yet.

You\'ll struggle, but you\'ll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts \'n Goblins.<br /><br />In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!<br /><br />In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur\'s inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!<br /><br />Make full use of Arthur\'s weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely.
