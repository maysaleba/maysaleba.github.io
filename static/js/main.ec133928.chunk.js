For example, the knight is thrilling the land, stunning all the enemies on the line, while the huntress is charging a bow with energy, simultaneously firing arrows at all the enemies.","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Drageus Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-21","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/guards-switch/hero","Slug":"guards-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/guards-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"60%","Price":"4.99","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Strategy","SalePrice":"1.99","MexPrice":"40.81"},{"SCORE":"51","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/9521/star-horizon-switch","SaleEnds":"2021-11-10","Title":"Star Horizon","LowestPrice":"2.49","SaleStarted":"2021-10-21","description":"KEY FEATURES: \u25aa Immersive action \u2013 engage in fast-paced, immersive space battles. \u25aa Upgrade your ship \u2013 buy upgrades and finish your enemies in multiple, fun ways. \u25aa Fun story - experience a mature story of a man and his AI spiced up with absurd and dark humour \u25aa Choices & consequences \u2013 make quick decisions \u2013 do you help your friends but fail your mission?

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia. Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds. Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay.

How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t want to be better than Asteroids; that\'s impossible. What we want is to make a tribute. And that\'s all we want.

Some shoot rockets, some try to intoxicate you, some place nasty mines on the ground...and then there are the final bosses as well, but we\'d rather not spoil you that. Accuracy and speed are necessary to be victorious over these damned creatures. But you may be overwhelmed, and that\u2019s why you should also look for new armor suits and upgrade them. Last but not least, your loyal dog will show you the direction to new ammo and HP boxes ready to pick-up. Friendly tip: do not mess with the gravestones in the cemetery if you don\u2019t want to meet Death (literally).

No place to run, and exactly one place to hide. As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Clickteam","ReleaseDate":"2019-11-29","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/f/five-nights-at-freddys-2-switch/hero","Slug":"five-nights-at-freddys-2-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/five-nights-at-freddys-2-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"35%","Price":"7.99","genre":"Strategy,Simulation","SalePrice":"5.19","MexPrice":"100.74"},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-07","Title":"Freakout: Calamity TV Show","LowestPrice":"2.49","SaleStarted":"2021-10-17","description":"Freakout: Calamity TV Show is a juicy Top-Down-Dual-Stick-Shooter inspired by old school arcade games and more recent Die & Retry shooters.

Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction.<br />Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons.<br />Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race.<br /><br />Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war.<br />Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.<br /><br />Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene!<br />Every corner of the game\'s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games.<br /><br />Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next.<br /><br />For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored.<br />From enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.<br /><br />Offline play enabled","genre":"Puzzle,Action,Platformer,Adventure","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0115/ot7twBoSGL0QzTD84JwCj0Vp.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/9260/rock-of-ages-3-make--break-playstation","PercentOff":"75%","PlusPrice":7.49,"Price":29.99,"Publisher":"Modus Games LLC","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-21","SCORE":"70","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":7.49,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:44","Slug":"rock-of-ages-3-make--break-playstation","Title":"Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4735-CUSA16370_00-ROCKOFAGES3SIEA0","description":"Rock of Ages 3: Make & Break is competitive tower defense and arcade action rolled up with ACE Team\'s quirky, Monty Python-esque humor into one giant, creative game for the ages.<br /><br />Jump into the expansive, gut-busting story for an eclectic adventure featuring bizarre and irreverent takes on legendary characters, or for the first time, create and share your own levels to compete with friends and strangers online in a real-time mix of hectic tower defense and epic boulder-racing arcade action.<br /><br />Key Features<br /><br />- Make & Break Worlds: Design and build your own levels in the easy-to-use editor and share your creations with players from all over the world for nearly limitless creative fun!<br /><br />- Competitive Tower Defense: Build defenses and race to destroy your opponents\' in up to 4-player online multiplayer, or head-to-head in 2-player split-screen action.<br /><br />- Boulder-Smashing Arcade Action: Crash your way through everything in your path as fast as you can in six distinct and arcadey game modes with over 20 zany boulders!<br /><br />- Absurdly Funny: Take a ride on the wild side with ACE Team\'s hilarious story \u2013 everyone from Caesar and Moctezuma to Krampus and the Spaghetti Monster make an appearance in an expansive campaign across history and beyond.<br /><br />- Game Modes Galore: Defend your base in the new Boulder Avalanche, perfect your rolling skills in the fragile Humpty-Dumpty Mode, race the clock in Time Trials, or create your own unique gameplay with the creator for hundreds of hours of fun!<br /><br />PS4 game can be controlled via PS Vita","genre":"Action,Strategy,Multiplayer,Racing","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307Icil4NJY5ns0ctrCU6yIDMc34VUBKxBc1bSouc4XDDIPQMyn6D78dVkjbPopiaRUUsHS7NdKjQDOQt2rxm4ATAt5nu3.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/572/the-sims-4-playstation","PercentOff":"88%","PlusPrice":4.79,"Price":39.99,"Publisher":"Electronic Arts Inc","ReleaseDate":"2017-11-17","SCORE":"70","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":4.79,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:11:24","Slug":"the-sims-4-playstation","Title":"The Sims 4","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA09209_00-THESIMS400000000","description":"New Look, Same Great Content<br />Unleash your imagination and create a unique world of Sims that\'s an expression of you!

Plunge into an atmospheric open world, teeming with life: from the majestic true-to-life animals to the rustling of leaves above you as you stalk your prey. You can decide to hunt on your own or join up and hunt together with friends. Just remember, you are not just a visitor in this world, you are a living and breathing part of it. As you finally spot the majestic crown of your first red deer through the brush, the feeling is indescribable.<br /><br />EXPLORE RESERVES ACROSS THE WORLD<br />In the 2021 Edition, you will be able to visit hunting grounds across the globe. Trek through the lavender fields of Parque Fernando, explore the lush snow covered landscape of Yukon Valley, traverse the regal foliage of Cuatro Colinas, or scale past the cloudline in the mountainous Silver Ridge Peaks. In these diverse reserves, you will be able to hunt animals of all shapes and sizes, from grizzly bears and wolves to turkeys, bighorn sheep, ibexes, and pumas. And that only scratches the surface of what these 4 regions have to offer.<br /><br />BRING THE PERFECT EQUIPMENT<br />When tracking your target, you need to bring the best possible equipment for the task, and 2021 Edition has you covered. Including 5 weapon and equipment packs, you will be able to prepare yourself for any hunting situation. Bring the drilling rifle along for versatility, the MN1890 or M1 for reliability, or the Muzzleloader for that old-time explosive shot. Or if you want to set up the perfect hiding spot to take down your target, utilize the treestands and tripods for maximum visibility.<br /><br />SHOWCASING YOUR TROPHIES<br />What better way to celebrate a successful hunt than showcasing your trophies in one of the two lodges included in the 2021 Edition. Decorate the walls and rooms in both the spacious 1800 British Mansion and more modern safari lodge with your prized kills, creating a visual representation and journey of your best hunting moments. Or simply use the multi trophy mounts to pose multiple animals and create a visually climactic moment involving your favourite trophies. Invite your friends to your lodge at any time and share your evolving collection.","genre":"Simulation,Sports","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202008/2016/RT32qXrpX8XPelxRpIRO42dd.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/10249/transformers-battlegrounds-playstation","PercentOff":"60%","PlusPrice":15.99,"Price":39.99,"Publisher":"Outright Games LLC","ReleaseDate":"2020-10-23","SCORE":"68","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":15.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:33","Slug":"transformers-battlegrounds-playstation","Title":"Transformers: Battlegrounds","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3824-CUSA17596_00-TRANSFOBASEGAME0","description":"With Earth under invasion and MEGATRON, leader of the Decepticons close to capturing The Allspark, BUMBLEBEE and the Autobots need a new commander to help them restore peace to the universe \u2013 you!<br /><br />Assemble your squad and roll out, for a turn-based tactical war that will rage from Central City to Cybertron itself.

When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?<br /><br />If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode!<br /><br />Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you\'ve mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play.<br /><br />You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it\'s close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type.<br /><br />The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it. Get your name up there and challenge your friends!<br /><br />The only question that remains is: what\'s outside the room?<br /><br />PlayStation\xa0VR headset compatible<br />PlayStation\xa0Camera compatible<br />Enhanced play with 2 PlayStation\xa0Move motion controllers<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202104/0210/o03fnVnzmBMW2v62ov49x5fw.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/breathedge-playstation","PercentOff":"40%","PlusPrice":14.99,"Price":24.99,"Publisher":"HYPETRAIN DIGITAL LTD","ReleaseDate":"2021-04-06","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-11 07:59:00","SalePrice":14.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:17","Slug":"breathedge-playstation","Title":"Breathedge","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4416-CUSA26770_00-5029723546049722","description":"Survive in outer space!

Revealing the restless events of Site 113 and its struggle to construct the generator before the freezing veil shrouds the Earth, this prequel expansion broadens the Frostpunk universe by introducing a new environment, new Books of Laws and unique technologies, and presents a range of new buildings \u2014 all of which let you shape society and the city in unconventional ways.<br />\u2022 On The Edge expansion tells a story of citizens of New London sent for a special assignment after the Great Storm.

In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive.<br />Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler\'s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and the present state.<br />What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?","genre":"Simulation,Strategy","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-playstation","PercentOff":"33%","PlusPrice":20.09,"Price":29.99,"Publisher":"Capcom U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-31","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":20.09,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:13","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-playstation","Title":"Ghosts \'n Goblins Resurrection","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA24159_00-MAKAIRE000000001","description":"Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes.<br /><br />Taking cues from both Ghosts \'n Goblins and Ghouls \'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name.<br /><br />Don\'t be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown!<br /><br />Story<br /><br />A long time ago...<br /><br />In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.<br />The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.<br />...but suddenly something\'s amiss, the town is up in flames,<br />a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.<br /><br />The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.<br />Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.<br />And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.<br />While Arthur\'s back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.<br /><br />In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.<br />To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />Just like its predecessors, Ghosts \'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy!<br /><br />Ghosts \'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You\'ll die, and you\'ll die again, but you\'ll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You\'ll struggle, but you\'ll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts \'n Goblins.<br /><br />In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!<br /><br />In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur\'s inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!<br /><br />Make full use of Arthur\'s weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you\'re going to need it!<br /><br />On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series.<br /><br />Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side.<br />Note: Local co-op only.

Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.<br /><br />The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.<br /><br />What\'s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\'ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.<br /><br />They don\'t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\'ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\'t happen but marketing text is hard to write.","genre":"Action,Platformer","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB E10-T","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP4491/CUSA01037_00/murHNPj3G2JBa7CXX3Uup8qiD5d3BFwQ.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/surgeon-simulator-ae--i-am-bread-playstation","PercentOff":"80%","PlusPrice":3.99,"Price":19.99,"Publisher":"BOSSA STUDIOS LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-26","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":3.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:11:48","Slug":"surgeon-simulator-ae--i-am-bread-playstation","Title":"Surgeon Simulator A&E + I Am Bread","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4491-CUSA01037_00-SSBREAD000000001","description":"2 unique games linked by a shared universe and distinctive humour!

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike.<br /><br />There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series.<br /><br />This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians.<br /><br />Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields.<br /><br />It\'s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive \u2013 lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment.<br /><br />Tannenberg\'s Maneuver game mode captures the essence of warfare on the Eastern Front, with 40 players, large open maps, and the freedom to choose which sectors you will attack and defend. Just make sure you don\'t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies!<br /><br />The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front). These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines.<br /><br />We recreate the atmosphere of the Eastern Front with the same level of accuracy as seen in Verdun. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references. The maps use realistic props and terrain layouts based on locations from the hilly forests of Galicia to a Polish village subjected to scorched earth tactics.<br /><br />This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content.<br />Gore and blood can be disabled completely with an in-game setting.","genre":"Action,First-Person","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202106/1613/a1eXEcc7kQdiuQDsUYfDhq2k.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/the-crew-2-gold-edition-playstation","PercentOff":"80%","PlusPrice":17.99,"Price":89.99,"Publisher":"Ubisoft Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2021-07-07","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":17.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:09","Slug":"the-crew-2-gold-edition-playstation","Title":"The Crew 2 Gold Edition","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-CUSA08600_00-TC2GOLD200000000","description":"The Crew 2 Gold Edition includes: <br />- Season Pass <br />- Digital Special Pack, which includes:<br />* DODGE CHALLENGER SRT DEMON Interception Unit<br />* PORSCHE 911 SPEEDSTER <br />The Motorsports Deluxe Pack which includes:<br />* FORD F-150 RAPTOR RACE TRUCK 2017<br />* ABARTH 500 2008 MONSTER TRUCK EDITION<br />* PILATUS PC-21<br />* 3 outfits to customize your avatar<br /><br />JOIN A COMMUNITY OF 30 MILLION PLAYERS!

In secret, the corporation began construction of Trailblazer Alpha, a state-of-the-art Mars research outpost designed to identify the true nature of the message.<br /><br />You are Shane Newehart, an engineer stationed at Trailblazer Alpha and your security clearance means you are completely unaware of the existence of the mysterious signal. Your job is simply to keep the lights on until the transport ship Cyrano arrives bringing with it a new team to take over your duties.<br /><br />Soon you discover strange and unusual setbacks. Crucial systems are malfunctioning, the greenhouse is filled with a strange mist and the rest of your team has yet to return from their EVA mission. <br />Things are starting to fall apart.<br /><br />You begin seeing and hearing things that aren\'t there. Visions, hallucinations \u2013 or is that even what it is? Is this real\u2026 or are you slowly descending into madness?<br /><br />Experience true cosmic horror<br />With your only hope of rescue hundreds of thousands of miles away, you will be forced to explore the real-world fears of isolation and paranoia, enhanced with supernatural elements and cosmic horror. Terrifying visions and monstrous apparitions will make you question what is real and what is not as the very fabric of reality threatens to tear at the seams.<br /><br />Explore the darker side of Mars <br />Navigate a functioning Mars base in a game that uses non-fiction elements to immerse players in a believable setting. Overcome obstacles using computers, electrical systems, rovers, solar panels and more, then go beyond the outpost and explore the darker side of Mars.<br /><br />Moons of Madness draws upon the rich lore and mythology of Funcom\'s Secret World Legends. Both games exist in the same thematic universe, but playing one is not a prerequisite to enjoy the other.","genre":"Adventure","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP4389/CUSA07711_00/9ylic5HecuRGG91uWDBxpzUZ5aPnz8HR.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/4837/baja-edge-of-control-hd-playstation","PercentOff":"85%","PlusPrice":4.49,"Price":29.99,"Publisher":"THQ Nordic","ReleaseDate":"2017-09-14","SCORE":"65","SaleEnds":"2021-10-28 06:59:00","SalePrice":4.49,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-19 19:05:49","Slug":"baja-edge-of-control-hd-playstation","Title":"Baja: Edge of Control HD","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4389-CUSA07711_00-BAJAHDUS00000001","description":"Baja: Edge of Control HD is the carefully remastered version of the original off-road racer from 2008 and contains more than 1,000 miles of the toughest terrain including the steepest mountains, thickest mud and deepest canyons known to man.<br /><br />Only the HD version features much crisper and more detailed visuals running at super smooth framerates in up to 4K screen resolution along with improved controls, user interface and an easier career start.<br /><br />Features:<br />4 player split screen and online multiplayer<br /><br />More than 160 vehicles to choose from<br /><br />Repair vehicle damage via truck and helicopter teams<br /><br />Revolutionary vehicle physics respond to every bump and rut you drive over<br /><br />200 authentic vehicle parts to fine-tune the performance of your off-road machine<br /><br />More than 100 tracks, nine open worlds and 1000 miles of drive-to-horizon landscape<br /><br />Lots of different events, including Hill Climb, Baja Endurance Rally, Circuit Tracks and more<br /><br />1-4 players","genre":"Sports,Racing","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Mature","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202008/0314/vSGFuHvjbvwegHRjaWjMM88J.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/9879/british-horror-bundle-playstation","PercentOff":"30%","PlusPrice":25.19,"Price":35.99,"Publisher":"Wales Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2020-08-12","SCORE":"65","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":25.19,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 07:10:35","Slug":"british-horror-bundle-playstation","Title":"British Horror Bundle","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4459-CUSA14893_00-4859035771997091","description":"Maid of Sker is a first-person survival horror, set in a remote hotel with a gory and macabre history from British folklore.

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality.<br /><br />In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.<br /><br />Features:<br />\u2022 Survive the horror using adventure mechanics and exploration.<br />\u2022 Experience a beautiful, erotic hand-painted art style with Eastern and Western influences.<br />\u2022 Unlock additional outfits, some of which alter interactions throughout the game.<br />\u2022 Keep track of the immersive lore with a convenient journal feature.<br />\u2022 Discover multiple New Game+ modes, alternate endings and hidden extras!<br />\u2022 Get in the mood with a visceral cinema-length soundtrack.<br /><br />PS Vita: One time license fee entitles play on up to 3 PlayStation Vita systems activated by this account.","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/0214/y3CRZCHFZCfc3kIiO1Jutsha.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":1,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/shing-playstation","PercentOff":"50%","PlusPrice":4.99,"Price":19.99,"Publisher":"Mass Creation","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-18","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":9.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 07:10:18","Slug":"shing-playstation","Title":"Shing!","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4396-PPSA02957_00-SHINGGAME0000002","description":"Experience the most exciting and immersive beat-em-up combat system ever \u2013 become a kickass ninja and slice some demons in style!

Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages.<br /><br />The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible.<br /><br />Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.<br /><br />As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.<br /><br />A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre.

You\'ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn\'t even bear imagining.<br /><br />Storyline<br />This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\'ll soon wish you could join the dead\'s ranks in their abyss, but death won\'t help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows?<br /><br />Dark entities<br />The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\'ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own.<br /><br />Gameplay<br />In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You\'ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it.<br /><br />Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you\'ll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Teen","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307TQRuBkpEMNOSz7zNpepxSnIwkP0iamqNnaacfTfBj7kFSUyAe-ROlMIOT8n7IMm9wjySg0gTBeQ--gWxbG3Mssn8pXS.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/waltz-of-the-wizard-extended-edition-playstation","PercentOff":"60%","PlusPrice":3.99,"Price":9.99,"Publisher":"Aldin Dynamics, ehf.","ReleaseDate":"2019-08-27","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":3.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 07:10:53","Slug":"waltz-of-the-wizard-extended-edition-playstation","Title":"Waltz of the Wizard: Extended Edition","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1452-CUSA16931_00-WOTWEE2019PSVR01","description":"Waltz of the Wizard is a virtual reality experience that lets you feel what it is like to have magical powers.
