Their only weakness, and yours, is sunlight, which means there's only one way to stop them: call them out on the streets, knock their clothes off, and expose their skin before they can do it to you.<br /><br />Arm yourself with a rolled-up poster, a guitar, a laptop, a magical girl wand, or (if you insist) an actual weapon, then hit Akihabara's colourful streets. Browse recreations of real-life shops circa 2011, mingle with Akiba's residents and tourists, and discover the town's many secrets.<br /><br />Will you work with the secret paranormal-hunting agency, give the creatures a fair shake (hey, some of them seem all right), or just look out for your otaku friends? Choose your side, choose your missions, and enjoy a freewheeling adventure with AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed.",

Their only weakness, and yours, is sunlight, which means there's only one way to stop them: call them out on the streets, knock their clothes off, and expose their skin before they can do it to you.<br /><br />Arm yourself with a rolled-up poster, a guitar, a laptop, a magical girl wand, or (if you insist) an actual weapon, then hit Akihabara's colorful streets. Browse recreations of real-life shops circa 2011, mingle with Akiba's residents and tourists, and discover the town's many secrets.<br /><br />Will you work with the secret paranormal-hunting agency, give the creatures a fair shake (hey, some of them seem all right), or just look out for your otaku friends? Choose your side, choose your missions, and enjoy a freewheeling adventure with AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed.",

    "Desc": "This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.<br /><br />In the far distant future, a psionic hormone was discovered in the human brain, granting people extra-sensory powers and changed the world as we knew it. As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity's last line of defense.<br /><br />Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF. As their different experiences interweave with each other, it is only then that you will reveal the full story and unlock all the mysteries of a Brain Punk future caught between technology and psychic abilities in SCARLET NEXUS.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Your team starts at the bottom, but you may be invited to take part in the major races if the organisers see that your results are good enough. <br />You can create and gradually level up your own rider in Pro Leader mode as you strive to become the next cycling legend to compete with the likes of Primoz Roglic, Tedej Pogacar and others. You can choose from four different profiles: climber, sprinter, puncher and versatile. Your choice will be crucial if your aim is to win a Grand Tour or be a specialist in the Classics!<br /><br />Create your own Tour<br />My Tour mode has been redesigned to offer you more freedom. With the new interface it is now easier to customise your \"My Tour\" (rest days, stages, teams). You can now choose the list of participating teams and national teams. Choose from 89 stages to create your race.<br /><br />Enjoy a wide range of content<br /><br />The game includes the 19 World Tour teams and their jerseys as well as the teams Alpecin-Fenix, B&B Hotels P/B KTM, Team Arkéa - Samsic and Total Direct Energie. There are also many official races (Paris-Roubaix, Paris-Nice, LBL, etc.)<br /><br />More realistic peloton<br />We have redesigned the actions of riders in the peloton to recreate the behaviour found in real races:<br />-Favourites ride closer to each other<br />- The yellow jersey is better placed at the front of the peloton<br />-Pursuit of the early breakaway is more realistic with fewer teams getting involved, which gives the leader's team the upper hand, just like in real life<br />- Teams that want to catch the breakaway but don't attack or that reduce the peloton in the race on the flat now have consistent behaviour<br /><br />Revamped objectives<br /><br />Before the start of each stage, you can now set the objective for each rider thanks to a new \"Select Rider\" page, which includes all the information you need to make a choice (ranking, role, race-day condition). Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race.<br /><br />A new recovery mechanic<br />Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. <br />Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating. The lower the rating, the more the recovery profile penalises the race-day condition.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Experience a realistic simulator game of being a Tank Mechanic.<br /><br />Find abandoned and destroyed tanks from battlefields of Second World War. Use special tools to find each tank, and extract it from the ground. Grow your repair service business and start your own tank museum.<br /><br />Start the engine of a newly renovated tank, and feel its former power!<br />Use different tools to work on tanks:<br />- Rust Removal Tool<br />- Sand Blaster<br />- Paint Gun<br />- Hammer<br />- Grinder - to cut and grind<br />- Wrench pistol - to quickly disassemble rusted screws/bolts<br /><br />Experience the full process of renovation:<br />- Clean the tank from mud<br />- De-rust the tank<br />- Sandblast the tank<br />- Apply primer paint to the tank<br />- Apply final paint to the tank (factory paint)<br />- Add custom paint, camouflage, color, decal in the paint room<br />- Sell the tank or put it in your museum to gain money and reputation<br /><br />Take a tank apart<br />Use tools and take each tank apart. You can disassemble tank exterior parts, from the bottom (wheels and tracks) up to the turret (gun, barrel, gun cradle etc.). Additionally, the interior of the tank is also available to be renovated, the crew space, tank engine and tank drive system.<br /><br />Take a seat inside the tank, as any of its crew. From here you can have better and easier access to the interior parts of the tank. Repair hatches, viewers, ammo holders, drive control components and gearbox parts.<br /><br />To start the tank, you need to repair its engine, gearbox and fuel system. Take the engine out and move it to a special engine stand, to be able to interact with it. Make sure the fuel, coolant and oil systems are assembled and the fluids are filled, so the tank engine can be put to test.<br /><br />High focus on details<br />Our tanks and vehicles are based on construction documents, expert opinions and insights from top II World War museums. Our goal is to give a fun and realistic simulation experience of building and repairing these legendary machines.<br /><br />Customize the tank as you wish, use different camouflages, paint colors, decals etc.<br />Find and extract tanks<br />One of the ways to obtain a tank is to get it during the extraction mission. After finding the spot where the tank is underground, call for the excavation team. Prepare the tank for extraction, by pumping the mud out of the tank and then cleaning the tank from whatever's left. Finally, order the lifting of the tank onto the truck trailer, to finish the mission, and move the tank into the workshop.<br /><br />Test your renovated tanks<br />Go on the training ground, check how your tank is dealing with special obstacles. Get inside the tank, start the engine and drive around to see if everything is working correctly.<br /><br />You can also take the tank to the proving grounds, where you are able to shoot the tank's armament on a special shooting range. You can use two different camera modes for better control of the tank.",

    "Desc": "This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.<br /><br />Below Zero is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean world. It is a new chapter in the Subnautica universe, and is developed by Unknown Worlds.<br /><br />Return to planet 4546B<br /><br />Submerge yourself in an all-new, sub-zero expedition in an arctic region of Planet 4546B. Arriving with little more than your wits and some survival equipment, you set out to investigate what happened to your sister...<br /><br />Uncover the Truth<br /><br />Alterra left in a hurry after a mysterious incident. Abandoned research stations dot the region. What happened to the scientists who lived and worked here? Logs, items, and databanks scattered among the debris paint a new picture of the incident. With limited resources, you must improvise to survive on your own.<br /><br />Discover Uncharted Biomes<br /><br />Swim beneath the blue-lit, arching expanses of Twisty Bridges. Become mesmerized by the glittering, mammoth crystals of the Crystal Caverns. Clamber up snow covered peaks and venture into the icy caves of Glacial Basin. Maneuver between erupting Thermal Vents to discover ancient alien artifacts. Below Zero presents entirely new environments for you to survive, study, and explore.<br /><br />Construct Habitats and Vehicles<br /><br />Survive the harsh climate by constructing extensive habitats, scavenging for resources, and crafting equipment. Blast across the snowy tundra on a Snowfox hoverbike. Cruise through enchanting and perilous biomes in your modular Seatruck.<br /><br />Research Alien Lifeforms<br /><br />Something undiscovered lurks around every corner. Swim through the giant Titan Holefish, encounter the haunting Shadow Leviathan, and visit the adorable Pengwings. Keep your wits about you. Not all creatures in this strange world are friendly.<br /><br />Survive the Chilly Temperatures<br /><br />Jump in, the water's warm. The below zero temperatures of this arctic region pose a new threat. New weather conditions blanket above-ground habitats. Craft a toasty cold suit, sip on piping hot coffee, and warm up next to Thermal Lilies to stave off the chill.<br /><br />An ocean of intrigue<br /><br />What really happened to your sister? Who were the aliens who came here before? Why were they on this planet? Can we find solace from grief in truth? Below Zero extends the story of the Subnautica universe, diving deep into the mystery introduced in the original game.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life.<br /><br />?Main Features?<br />? Exploring with new field actions!<br />Ryza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively.<br />? More action-filled real-time battles!<br />Take on your enemies using an improved “real-time tactics” battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever. Speedily switch between characters, choose varied skills, and utilize items in just the right moments for best results.<br />? Straightforward and easy-to-use synthesis!<br />Utilize several new synthesis systems, including the new intuitive “Linkage Synthesis” system where items are placed in cells called “Material Loops”, that are designed to allow both new players to easily learn synthesis, and experienced players to create unique customized items. Created items can also be mixed and matched with “Evolution Link” to create entirely new items.<br /><br />Note:<br />- Please visit the official website for more information on the listed content: https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/ryza2/<br />- Sets that include the main game, such as “Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy Digital Deluxe Edition” and “Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy Ultimate Edition” are also currently on sale.",

    "Desc": "This is not just another RTS, in which you are an invisible being hovering over the battlefield. In Radio Commander situation reports are given to you in form of dramatic radio statements sent by troops fighting on the ground. And your only accessory is a strategic map, on which you can place tokens and notes.<br /><br />Radio Commander offers an unique experience very different from classic real time strategy games. It's a bold try to redefine the genre, as the player will be involved in a decision making process much more realistic than those pictured by casual RTS titles. Ask for situation reports. Listen what your men have to tell you. Send evac choppers and nape drops. Defeat the invisible enemy.<br /><br />Decide the fate of your soldiers. The choices you face will have a direct impact on the course of the game. They will also define views of your hero. Or maybe those are your views? Playing Radio Commander you must be prepared to answer tough questions about the righteousness of your actions, the price of a human life, and the toxic power of propaganda and stereotypes.<br /><br />Radio Commander includes:<br />- 9 main campaign missions (every mission is possible to complete in several different ways),<br />- 9 animated briefings,<br />- 15 unit types, including: infantry, evac choppers, gunships, field artillery, aerial reconnaissance, M113 armored personnel carriers, and napalm-carrying F4 Phantom jets (every unit is described by a unique set of statistics and communicates with commander using a different voice),<br />- full voice over,<br />- over 200 dialogue blocks, used to construct radio messages,<br />- over 600 story dialogues between units and the commander.",

    "Desc": "The Last Dead End is an adventure game with the elements of FPS and horror.<br /><br />In this game, we play the role of young scientist Farhad Novruzov, who returned to his homeland to help in filming a documentary movie for an international television channel.

Most actions and active research take place in the first person view. The main action of the game takes place in Baku, Azerbaijan. It takes place in an actually existing inner city of Baku. This is the oldest district of the city with a thousand-year history, surrounded by a fortress wall, inside which along with the old streets, there are dozens of historical and archaeological sites.<br />There are several regular enemies in the game, as well as strong enemies (bosses), that were inspired by local legends. In the fight against some of them, there is its own tactic of winning them.<br /><br />The game has an extensive encyclopedia and the possibility of research. Articles in a vast encyclopedia, containing articles about historical objects, characters, symbols, etc., are added along the course of the game. In the game there are various items that can be selected, viewed from all sides, learn information about them. With the help of technological glasses, which the main character has, you can read and decipher the inscriptions in the ancient languages that are on the walls of the old city.<br /><br />Some of the locations are built one-to-one with real city and historical buildings, the game has many objects that reflect the national flavor of the old city.<br /><br />Most of the game takes place in unusual locations for the genre - a flooded fortress, an ancient palace, ancient ruins, etc. This is one of the rare games in the genre, with elements of horror, where action takes place in a real city, enveloped in a mystical atmosphere.<br /><br />Survival mode.

    "Desc": "The story of Raji: An Ancient Epic begins with the start of a new war between the demons and the gods. Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction.<br />Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons.<br />Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race.<br /><br />Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war.<br />Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.<br /><br />Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene!<br />Every corner of the game's environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games.<br /><br />Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next.<br /><br />For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored.<br />From enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

    "Desc": "theHunter: Call of the Wild 2021 Edition lets you dive into a hunting experience like no other, containing the base game, 4 reserves, 3 weapon packs, 3 equipment packs and 2 trophy lodges. Plunge into an atmospheric open world, teeming with life: from the majestic true-to-life animals to the rustling of leaves above you as you stalk your prey. You can decide to hunt on your own or join up and hunt together with friends. Just remember, you are not just a visitor in this world, you are a living and breathing part of it. As you finally spot the majestic crown of your first red deer through the brush, the feeling is indescribable.<br /><br />EXPLORE RESERVES ACROSS THE WORLD<br />In the 2021 Edition, you will be able to visit hunting grounds across the globe. Trek through the lavender fields of Parque Fernando, explore the lush snow covered landscape of Yukon Valley, traverse the regal foliage of Cuatro Colinas, or scale past the cloudline in the mountainous Silver Ridge Peaks. In these diverse reserves, you will be able to hunt animals of all shapes and sizes, from grizzly bears and wolves to turkeys, bighorn sheep, ibexes, and pumas. And that only scratches the surface of what these 4 regions have to offer.<br /><br />BRING THE PERFECT EQUIPMENT<br />When tracking your target, you need to bring the best possible equipment for the task, and 2021 Edition has you covered. Including 5 weapon and equipment packs, you will be able to prepare yourself for any hunting situation. Bring the drilling rifle along for versatility, the MN1890 or M1 for reliability, or the Muzzleloader for that old-time explosive shot. Or if you want to set up the perfect hiding spot to take down your target, utilize the treestands and tripods for maximum visibility.<br /><br />SHOWCASING YOUR TROPHIES<br />What better way to celebrate a successful hunt than showcasing your trophies in one of the two lodges included in the 2021 Edition. Decorate the walls and rooms in both the spacious 1800 British Mansion and more modern safari lodge with your prized kills, creating a visual representation and journey of your best hunting moments. Or simply use the multi trophy mounts to pose multiple animals and create a visually climactic moment involving your favourite trophies. Invite your friends to your lodge at any time and share your evolving collection.",

    "Desc": "Dear Potential servant of chaos,<br /><br />Being evil isn't always easy… But boy it is so much more fun than being a good guy!<br /><br />Having someone witty like you on my team could be useful during these not so dark times.<br /><br />Everything in Darkestville was fine and dandy: I was tormenting the town people, the town people were being tormented… It was a fair deal! Who could complain? Not me, that's for sure!<br /><br />…until that moron, Dan Teapot, hired a group of professional demon hunters to banish me! I don't even know why he has a grudge against me. Maybe I burnt his house a couple of times, but I only did it because it was hilarious!<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />Help me in this adventure to best my foes and let's make evil reign Darkestville once more!<br /><br />Also by purchasing this game you are helping a noble cause, part of your money will be used to enslave mankind… I mean…  to clean the seas from pollution, create a sanctuary for the only Endangered Invisible Flamingo on this planet and other kind of noble sounding lies.<br /><br />Sincerely Evil,<br />Cid<br /><br />P.S. So you're trembling with fear already, aren't you? That's the spirit! Because this game is not only TERRIBLY interesting but also TERRIBLY funny! If you ever enjoyed Tim Schafer's classic adventure games and are fond of the Time Burton's black humor, we're about to go along with you as these two Tims are my bros.<br /><br />Sure I wouldn't be Cid if I didn't add a couple of dozens of the cunning puzzles so don't you wait a cakewalk. They say it takes seven hours to complete this game… Well let's see if you can do it! I trust you can though – my incredible charm and fascinating sense of style are more than enough to overcome any challenge!<br /><br />P.P.S. While you were reading this, someone just rang the doorbell of my castle and left a box with an “INDIE PRIZE - Best Game Narrative” tag on it. Well… just another acknowledgment of my incomparable awesomeness!",

    "Desc": "Dark times mean fear and risks. The risk to be caught by patrolling National Socialists, looking for people who publicly stand against their point of view. The risk of being beaten up or even killed by the German military because we‘re opposing the regime. The risk of losing everything, including our loved ones. This is how we live. This is how we try to survive. Through the darkest of times.<br /><br />Plan, Act, Survive<br />You are the leader of a small resistance group in 1933's Berlin, of ordinary people, from Jews to Catholics and Communists to Patriots who simply can't stand aside. Your goal is to deal with small blows to the regime – dropping leaflets to spread awareness about what the Nazis are really up to among the people, painting messages on walls, sabotaging, gathering information and recruiting more followers. And all of that while staying undercover – if the regime's forces learn about your group, the life of each member is in grave danger.<br /><br />Experience history<br />Through the Darkest of Times is a historical resistance strategy game, focusing on conveying the somber mood of the period and the very real struggles of average people living in the 3rd Reich. Historical accuracy means that your small group of resistance fighters will not change the outcome of the war, nor will you prevent all of the Nazi's atrocities, but you can certainly do everything in your power to save as many lives as you can and oppose the fascist system wherever possible.<br /><br />Features:<br />• Experience the Darkest of Times in 4 chapters<br />• Fight for freedom, weaken the regime and lead your resistance group<br />• Plan activities, find collaborators and try not to get caught<br />• Feel the weight of responsibility as you make difficult decisions and face the dire consequences<br />• Beautifully illustrated expressionistic scenes and events",

    "Desc": "Become the real thief. Steal in free roam sandbox neighborhoods. Observe your target and gather information that will help you with the burglary. Take the challenge and rob the best secured houses. Buy some hi-tech burglar equipment and learn new thief tricks. Sell stolen goods to the passers. Do anything that a real thief does!<br /><br />A good thief always observes his target. What's inside? Who lives there? What's your target day schedule? Find out when the house is empty and does it have nosy neighbours. Choose from lots of possible approaches to prepare the best plan. Many modern devices available in Thief Simulator might come in handy with gathering intel about your target and it's neighbourhood.<br /><br />The faster, the better. Find and steal as many valuables as possible in the shortest time possible. Remember that infinite backpacks don't exist. When it's about time you have to maintain cold blood. In every house you'll find tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you're not sure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police attention to you!<br /><br />A real, experienced thief can spot places where there's most probability of finding some valuables on the fly. Use the flashlight at night to highlight all the valuables in sight and places where you can expect them to be.<br /><br />Disassemble a stolen car and sell parts on the internet. Prepare phones and tablets before selling them in a pawn shop by removing their security.<br /><br />Be careful! In some houses you can meet unexpected guests. If they catch you in the act, they will call the police. In this case hide and wait till they stop looking for you or you can always leave the loot and run away as fast as possible.",

There is only one option: They'll have to split all bubbles and free their friends on the lower floors. Along the way, who knows what they might encounter…<br /><br />Arcade Mode<br />Be sure to check out the party mode that comes with mutators which add another layer of chaos.

Are you ready to explore the wilds of the Australian Outback in this remastered version of the classic game, TY the Tasmanian Tiger?<br /><br />Join TY on a RIPPER of an adventure to free his family from the DREAMING and stop the nefarious evil genius BOSS CASS from removing mammals from the top of the food chain.<br /><br />To help you on your quest, you've got a BEAUT arsenal of boomerangs, sharp teeth, and the help of a few friends!<br /><br />So don't be a galah - let's head down under, and have a CORKER of a time! BEAUTY, BOTTLER, BONZA!<br /><br />* Explore 17 levels of the Australian Outback in their old-school 3D platforming glory<br />* 13 different boomerangs including the Frostyrang, Flamerang and powerful Doomerang<br />* Improved camera & graphics; including updated shadows, reflections, HD resolutions and 60fps<br />* New Gamemode called \"Hardcore Mode\"<br />* New TY character skins<br />* Audio Director's cut<br />* Over 35 Trophies, including a Platinum Trophy, plus Speed Run and Time Attack Leaderboards.<br /><br />* * * * *<br /><br />G'day mate! Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago.<br /><br />But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure!<br /><br />You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open!<br /><br />Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans!<br /><br />Don't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie. Now let's get down to brass tacks, find those Talismans, and rescue your family!<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled",

    "Desc": "Three stories, three outcasts, three nerds… and a single destiny: to make the best video game ever.<br /><br />Indiecalypse depicts the crude reality of indie game developers and their struggles to get their shit together when it comes to releasing a video game.<br /><br />Three misfits team up to design and produce their own indie game, finding themselves in a path of chaos, self-destruction and resentment. But there's also space for crude humor, pop culture references, gratuitous and non-gratuitous violence... and fear. Fear of the dozens of lawsuits for copyright infringement, obscenity and profanity we'll have to face if the game is finally published.<br /><br />Not everything is what it seems in Indiecalypse, and we know for sure that no one will be left indifferent after playing it.<br /><br />Features:<br />- The definitive Indie Developer Experience<br />- More than 20 mini-games, most of them inspired by well-know indie games<br />- Different playable characters: Jack, Ethan & Violet<br />- Dark Humor",

Control her special abilities (double jump, dash and climb) and do your best to react at the correct time.<br />- Minimalistic 2D artistic style completely drawn by hand.<br />- Dynamic gameplay in a poetic and eccentric world.<br />- Single-screen levels which combine skill and ingenuity with planification and strategy.<br />- Two game modes: Main Story and Memory Chest.

    "Desc": "Savage, nightmarish monsters roam the Louisiana swamps, and you are part of a group of rugged bounty hunters bound to rid the world of their ghastly presence. Banish these creatures from our world, and you will be paid generously—and given the chance to buy more gruesome and powerful weapons. Fail, and death will strip you of both character and gear. Your experience, however, remains in your pool of hunters—called your Bloodline—always.<br /><br />Hunt's competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each Bounty Hunt match, up to 12 players set out to track their monstrous targets. Depending on which mode and team options you've chosen, that 12 will include a combination of solo players and teams of two or three. Once they've found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty—and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map.",

    "Desc": "Ash of Gods is a tactical turn-based RPG with rich lore and detailed nonlinear storyline about three heroes facing an ancient mythical evil. Captain Thorn Brenin, the guard Lo Pheng and scribe Hopper Rouley don't yet know that the Reapers have returned and are planning to drown the world in blood so they can awaken the slumbering gods.<br /><br />The story can change at any time depending on your choices, sometimes leading to a character's death. This won't end the game, however, as the narrative continues without the hero but takes into account the consequences of his demise on future events. Don't rely on a single tactic or a powerful team to win the game – the AI in Ash of Gods adapts to your gaming style and forces you to be more cunning!<br /><br />The Ash of Gods graphics are completely hand-drawn with the use of live action video, creating realistic and detailed animations.",

    "Desc": "Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.<br /><br />From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddy bear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!<br /><br />Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?",

They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!<br /><br />What could go wrong?<br /><br />As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.<br /><br />As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.",

    "Desc": "Solo: Islands of the Heart is a game about love. About love as fuel, the force that drives us.<br /><br />Love is a universal feeling, but each of us experiences it in a different way. Solo – Islands of the Heart explores the theme of love in an introspective way, allowing players to identify and reflect on their own experiences.<br /><br />The world is divided into archipelagos, with each island representing a unique puzzle. Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.<br /><br />As with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island.<br /><br />Nature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.",

Face your inner demons and fight the power of evil while it seduces your soul.

The dark and striking atmosphere is often cut by the wicked humour of the always witty Padre. You will need to use your brains to solve challenging puzzles, as well as your brawns to fend off monsters, all at the same time while you try to unravel the mysteries of the mansion, yourself and the eternal fight between good and evil. Be weary though, if you fail enough times it's a permanent GAME OVER for you!",

    "Desc": "RIOT – Civil Unrest is the highly anticipated real-time riot simulator that places the player right in the heart of some of the world's most fractious clashes. Campaigns include: Indignados (Spain), Arab Spring (Egypt), Keratea (Greece) and NoTAV (Italy). Seventeen single level scenarios include Rome, Oakland, Paris, London and Ukraine.<br /><br />RIOT – Civil Unrest's creator, Leonard Menchiari, experienced rioting first-hand at the NoTAV protests in Italy. He created the game to tell the stories and express the feelings experienced during these clashes. What triggers the crowd to behave with such anger and aggression? Often outnumbered, what does a police officer feel like during the conflict? RIOT – Civil Unrest presents the player with the opportunity to experience both sides of the fight - a fight in which there really are no winners. Who is right and who is wrong? Experience RIOT – Civil Unrest and draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />1-4 players<br />3GB minimum save size<br /><br />RIOT - Civil Unrest developed by IV Productions, published by Merge Games Ltd. © 2018.

Decisions made in one character's story can affect the story of another character in unforeseen ways, culminating in a total of over 50 different endings!<br /><br />Real-Life Shibuya, Tokyo – Engaging text combines with immersive live action stills and video sequences to bring you into the heart of Shibuya's famous scramble crossing and into the intricate plot that unfolds!<br /><br />428: Shibuya Scramble is a trademark of Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.<br />Licensed to and Published by Spike Chunsoft, Inc.",

In addition to the classic dot-pixel graphics being upscaled to 1080p and additional 4k resolution support, this “remastered” port of METAL SLUG XX is fully functional with DUALSHOCK4 game controllers, including vibration support to make the heated battle feel even more hectic, and fan-favorite voice samples played through the controller's speaker during the release of POWs and other in-game events. METAL SLUG XX also offers two different types of scanlines for players who want a true nostalgia trip, as well as newly implemented Trophies for those who love a good challenge! In addition to the six characters found in the original release, “the silent soldier” Leona Heidern is now playable from the beginning for even more action!

    "Desc": "From Santa Monica Studio and creative director Cory Barlog comes a new beginning for one of gaming's most recognizable icons. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.<br /><br />•\tBold New Beginning — His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. <br />•\tA Second Chance — Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.<br />•\tA Darker, More Elemental World — From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore God of War's breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise.<br />•\tVicious, Physical Combat — With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.",

    "Desc": "Once upon a time, there was a poor boy named Hans who lived with his mother near the woods. On his birthday, the boy had no presents nor sweets. He got so upset he decided to leave home for good. Before he left, his mother gave him his grandfather's cane, some cheese and three pieces of gold. Hans walked into the forest in search of adventure. Soon it was night and the boy was really scared, so he tried to go back. But then, a quaint kobold happened to cross his path and Hans decided to follow him to a castle. The kobold told him he would inherit great wealth if he passed a simple trial... guessing his name. Trapped in the castle, Hans will live a spooky mystery, fantasy and horror adventure to become the new Count Lucanor.<br /><br />The Count Lucanor developed by Baroque Decay Games, published by Merge Games Ltd. © 2017.

Expelled from his yakuza family, Kiryu is released from prison to a city he no longer recognizes. Chaos erupts when 10 billion yen vanishes from the Tojo Clan vault, and with Kiryu caught in the middle, he finds everything points to a young, mysterious girl named Haruka. Together, they must survive to find the answers they both seek.  <br />In 2005, a legend was born on the PlayStation2 – Kazuma Kiryu, the Dragon of Dojima, made his video game debut in Yakuza. Now, 11 years after that release, a new generation of players will be able to experience the incomparable action and drama of the Yakuza series with the rebuilt-from-scratch HD remake exclusive to PlayStation4, Yakuza Kiwami.",

    "Desc": "NEET: Short for “Not in Employment, Education, or Training.” Asahi Tachibana is a textbook NEET, living a lazy, cozy life in Akihabara, the infamous Tokyo district renowned for its proliferation of anime and video game merchandise, maid cafes, pop idols, and all other forms of counterculture indulgence. To him, every day is Sunday.<br /><br />Little does he know, however, that every day is about to become Sunday for real! Caught in a temporal loop, Asahi is one of only a chosen few whose memories don't reset with it. He and a small group of fellow time-displaced losers must now scour Akihabara for signs of delusions – people's innermost fantasies made manifest, changing the cityscape and the behavior of its citizens alike – and attempt to relegate them back to the realm of fantasy where they belong, in the hopes that this gets things moving forward once more.<br /><br />Join Asahi and his crew in this lengthy, story-driven action RPG, and help save Japan's otaku mecca from being corrupted forever!",

    "Desc": "The glitz, glamour, and unbridled decadence of the 80s are back in Yakuza 0.  Fight like hell through Tokyo and Osaka with protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and series regular Goro Majima. Play as Kazuma Kiryu and discover how he finds himself in a world of trouble when a simple debt collection goes wrong and his mark winds up murdered.  Then, step into the silver-toed shoes of Goro Majima and explore his “normal” life as the proprietor of a cabaret club.  <br />Switch between three different fighting styles instantaneously and beat up all manner of goons, thugs, hoodlums, and lowlifes.  Take combat up a notch by using environmental objects such as bicycles, sign posts, and car doors for bone-crunching combos and savage take-downs.<br />Fighting is not the only way to kill time in 1988's Japan: from discos and hostess clubs to classic SEGA arcades, there are tons of distractions to pursue in the richly detailed, neon-lit world.<br /><br />PS4 game can be controlled via PS Vita",

Four levels of difficulty, six worlds to conquer, twelve mid and end-of-level bosses, seven god-like armour sets, five basic weapons and thirty-five magic combat spells!<br /><br />The evil emperor Zaraaima has kidnapped the infant heir to the land of Dareca. King Kandar must call upon the aid of the seven gods of Dareca as he traverses the six worlds of his kingdom in a bid to save his son. He must face the emperor's hordes as he battles through dark woods, slimy swamps, sinister mills, infernal volcanos, snowy mountains, golden cities and demonic castles. Each world is guarded by level bosses each sworn to bring about the king's swift demise. To help him in his quest King Kandar can invoke god-given armour, wield different weapons and cast fanatical spells. Can the King save his son and his kingdom or will Dareca fall into the evil emperor's grasp? <br /><br />Cast of the Seven Godsends - Redux is developed by Raven Travel Studios, production support from IV Productions and published by Merge Games Ltd. © 2015.

Working as a night-watchman at a partially abandoned, secret research facility, you are knocked unconscious by a nearby explosion. Waking in the complex's basement you look up and see a gaping hole in the ceiling. Escaping the damaged building is only the start of your troubles and as you begin to explore the base you encounter strange, unearthly organisms. Is this all because of some sort of biological experiment gone wrong? You'll need to fight for survival as you unravel the mysteries and solve the problems that lie ahead.<br /><br />Albedo: Eyes from Outer Space developed by Z4G0 and IV Productions, published by Merge Games Ltd. © 2015.

    "Desc": "Kagura and Saaya are schoolgirl sisters raised together by the Vampiric Clan, and rank among their strongest warriors. Aya and Saki are assassin sisters descended from the rival Baneful Bloodline, and represent their lineage with esteem. <br />Now, these four must learn to fight together against an undead army. Brought under one banner known as the “Zombie Punitive Force,” these blood enemies will have to reach a mutual understanding in order to save the world as we know it.<br />And as long as they're working together, they might as well do it in style…<br />Onechanbara Z2: Chaos is the latest entry in the Onechanbara series. Two sets of buxom vampire sisters battle through over a dozen stages of high-octane real-time swordplay. Fight off the invasion in gruesome detail, occasionally transforming into a demon for short bursts of added power and speed. Enjoy the gameplay experience with the original Japanese voices or – for the first time in series history – a full English dub.<br /><br />(c) 2015 TAMSOFT (c) 2015 D3 PUBLISHER.

Thanks for playing!<br /><br />Combining the spy mythology and bold aesthetics of the 1950's and 1960's and set during the Cold War, CounterSpy focuses on the rogue third spy agency, C.O.U.N.T.E.R., that keeps the world's super powers at bay. Just as each side of the ongoing conflict gets close to unleashing a blow of earthshaking proportions, C.O.U.N.T.E.R. jumps into action, stealthily sabotaging their dastardly plans and deceptively maintaining world peace.<br /><br />For one price, get this content for your PS4, PS3 or PlayStationVita systems.

A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened by the “research and charity” branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation, the asylum has been operating in strict secrecy… until now.<br /><br />Acting on a tip from an anonymous source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into the facility, and what he discovers walks a terrifying line between science and religion, nature and something else entirely. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies with the terrible truth at the heart of Mount Massive.<br /><br />Outlast is a true survival horror experience which aims to show that the most terrifying monsters of all come from the human mind.",
