She is ready for a peaceful summer of wildlife exploration with her friend Ines, but when she sees an animal in danger, she realises she needs to do something about it!<br /><br />This is truly a Mediterranean paradise if you ignore all the litter! From the idyllic beaches to the ancient castle overlooking the town a whole island is ready to be explored. With Ines and your grandfather - who is a total bird nerd - by your side, you can start the movement to save the island. Maybe even the world after that.<br /><br />What you can expect:<br />- Great music. We worked with Lorena Alvarez, to make a soundtrack that is equal parts Spain and Amazing<br />- This is a Chillectathon. Make your time on the island your own and experience the adventure at your own pace. No rush<br />- A place you want to stay. We based this on our childhood summers and, well, we wish we could go back. This island is the next best thing<br />- Honestly, a feel-good game about running around and doing good deeds<br /><br />Features:<br />- Handcrafted visuals. Every little corner of the island has been looked after with great detail. Trust me, it took us a while to make it<br />- Join Alba and Ines to found the AIWRL (really rolls off the tongue doesn't it?), an organisation that can save the island<br />- You will need to gather a bunch of volunteers and the town is full of good people. Help them out and inspire them to join you<br />- There are animals everywhere, can you find all the species?",

Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life.<br /><br />《Main Features》<br />■ Exploring with new field actions!<br />Ryza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively.<br />■ More action-filled real-time battles!<br />Take on your enemies using an improved “real-time tactics” battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever. Speedily switch between characters, choose varied skills, and utilize items in just the right moments for best results.<br />■ Straightforward and easy-to-use synthesis!<br />Utilize several new synthesis systems, including the new intuitive “Linkage Synthesis” system where items are placed in cells called “Material Loops”, that are designed to allow both new players to easily learn synthesis, and experienced players to create unique customized items. Created items can also be mixed and matched with “Evolution Link” to create entirely new items.<br /><br />Note:<br />- Please visit the official website for more information on the listed content: https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/ryza2/<br />- Sets that include the main game, such as “Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy Digital Deluxe Edition” and “Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy Ultimate Edition” are also currently on sale.",

You tessellate shapes to cover a grid, while a beatline reads those shapes as notes. As you cover the board the music builds to a beautiful crescendo of your own design. The only way to discover Chime is to play it, but if you want a glimpse, consider what it might feel like to cross Tetris, a music sequencer and a hypnotic dream about your favourite pop song.<br /><br />Chime Sharp takes Chime's classic dynamic and updates it for 2017. The core rules are the same but the aesthetic is clean and modern and the game's soundtrack has been completely refreshed. With sixteen new levels, experimental modes, new-era connectivity and sharper ways to play, Chime's finally back -- and it wants to be your new favourite mixtape.",

Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet.<br /><br />There is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective.<br /><br />ABOUT<br /><br />Backbone is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation.<br /><br />Backbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY<br /><br />Backbone's gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you.<br /><br />As Howard, you will:<br /><br />• Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth <br />• Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be <br />• Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver <br />• Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss <br />• Be a raccoon<br /><br />FEATURES<br /><br />Post-noir dystopia<br /><br />Backbone's Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It's a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better.<br /><br />Stunning visuals<br /><br />The breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic animals.<br /><br />Evocative and unforgettable soundtrack<br /><br />Original doom jazz soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab features an innovative combination of classic jazz and electronic music. Backbone's OST is expertly crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape that serves and enhances storytelling.",

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They're not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”.<br /><br />Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.<br /><br />If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You're the perfect candidate for our test chambers!<br /><br />That being said, welcome and good luck!",

Captain Thorn Brenin, the guard Lo Pheng and scribe Hopper Rouley don't yet know that the Reapers have returned and are planning to drown the world in blood so they can awaken the slumbering gods.<br /><br />The story can change at any time depending on your choices, sometimes leading to a character's death. This won't end the game, however, as the narrative continues without the hero but takes into account the consequences of his demise on future events. Don't rely on a single tactic or a powerful team to win the game – the AI in Ash of Gods adapts to your gaming style and forces you to be more cunning!<br /><br />The Ash of Gods graphics are completely hand-drawn with the use of live action video, creating realistic and detailed animations.",

Private Investigator Pierce is sent to look into the tragic death of the Hawkins family on the isolated Darkwater Island. Soon enough, Pierce is pulled into a terrifying world of conspiracies, cultists, and cosmic horrors. Nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and sinister cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything.<br /><br />Your mind will suffer - between sanity and psychosis, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Slinking shadows hide lurking figures… and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.",

It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece.<br /><br />For the solo voyager, the ship's computer-controlled cat will keep you company. Without a second pair of hands, Albert will need an extra dose of dexterity to navigate the challenges of Victorian space flight.<br /><br />The mix of action and thoughtful puzzles make 39 Days to Mars perfect for playing in short sessions. The entire adventure fits comfortably into an evening, or a long tea break.<br /><br />The HMS Fearful is ready to embark for Mars!<br /><br />1-2 players<br />380MB minimum save size",

This includes features such as taunts, character-specific intros, and even Super Moves! <br />ART OF FIGHTING 1 and ART OF FIGHTING 2 primarily focus on the Sakazaki family and their escapades in South Town, with the goal of rescuing Yuri Sakazaki or taking down the corrupt police commissioner Geese Howard, respectively. ART OF FIGHTING 3 goes in a different direction, with the plot focusing on family friend of the Sakazaki's, Robert Garcia, as he travels to Mexico to search for a childhood friend.<br />This release also includes the option to switch between the original arcade soundtrack and a bonus arrange soundtrack, along with the option to customize characters with a color-edit system.<br /><br />This title has been converted from the original PlayStation2 version to the PS4 system. Consequently, there may be times where the title plays differently from the PlayStation2 version, or where some features may not function properly. This version does not support PlayStation2 peripherals, therefore some functionality may not be available.",

Actually I have a list of great things to do instead, but today I would love you to join us and play Alexio. This game is a blast among the fans of really hard and challenging titles. You're gonna love it!<br /><br />The premise is simple: this is the game about the little duckling Alex. The day when he turned 6 he learned the hard truth from his father — to become a true drake he had to complete the journey on his own and find his monobrow during his travels. Alex had a hard time trying to get some sleep, because he knew that this journey would be the most exciting thing for him ever. You will have to travel with Alex, overcome a set of obstacles and get through the meadows, lakes, mountains, woods, caves and ancient ruins on your way to the temple that keeps your hard-earned reward.

        "description": "You find yourself in a room with no exits. Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?<br /><br />If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode!<br /><br />Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play.<br /><br />You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type.<br /><br />The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it. Get your name up there and challenge your friends!<br /><br />The only question that remains is: what's outside the room?<br /><br />PlayStation VR headset compatible<br />PlayStation Camera compatible<br />Enhanced play with 2 PlayStation Move motion controllers<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled",

I love creating simple, fun and well designed games. My biggest inspirations are games from the 8-bit and 16-bit era. I like every aspect in the process of making video games: pixel art, coding, game design and drawing. I've worked on several indie games in the past - Castle Of Pixel Skulls is one of my last solo developed games and it was in development for about one year.<br /><br />Key features:<br /><br />- 4 different chapters with 10 levels each: a total of 40 levels full of madness and challenges!<br /><br />- Dangerous traps and enemies: spikes, fireballs, lava, timed platforms, skeletons, and more!<br /><br />- Timed levels: replay the levels as many times as you want and try to beat your previous score.<br /><br />- Classic arcade platformer playstyle: old school difficulty of classic NES platform titles.<br /><br />- Simple and accessible controls<br /><br />- Easy to play, hard to master",

Your path will consist of difficult choices and everyone will have an influence on the outcome.<br />…and perhaps you might be able to solve the mystery of this universe.<br /><br />FLYING AMONG THE STARS<br /><br />You are the commander of the “Melistar” (“The Star Bee”), and you have a swarm of intelligent anthropomorphic bees. Your ship is your home, and your mission is to keep an eye on its fighting ability to repel enemy attacks; to stay on course, and to effectively collect resources to ensure that both the Queen and soldier bees have enough food; and, of course, to keep an eye on the status of your crew, whose members strive to get into trouble or arrange it.<br /><br />OTHER SPECIES<br /><br />The ship travels through an amazing universe full of strange insectoid races. Who you'll be forming an alliance with, and who you'll be fighting with, is largely up to you! The Merchant Guild fights the League of Smugglers; the intelligent Ants compete with Locusts for space colonies; the sinister cult of Blood Suckers spreads across the galaxy...<br />We'll have to fight and trade – and every one of these decisions can be a turning point in the story.<br /><br />SURVIVAL AND STORYTELLING<br /><br />* You can try your hand at surviving. Space cycles alternate, resources run out – and the crew increases; but luck and accurate calculation are on your side! Competently upgrade your ship and set the right course – and you can stay alive for a certain amount of time, or maybe even break a record!<br />* If you like branching plots and world exploration – boldly immerse yourself in the storyline. The CyberHive universe is a mysterious and deep setting. Collect ancient artifacts and pieces of knowledge on distant planets about the past – and discover how the world turned out to be and what misfortune it faces. Maybe you can avert it... or not.<br /><br />MANY EVENTS<br /><br />As you try to find resources and survive, you will experience many events on the ship: from intrigues within the crew and problems with passengers, to a large contraband “set-up” or a collision with the ghost of a legendary pirate starship. Some events form a story, and some occur randomly. But the choices within each event will also have to be considered...<br /><br />...Subjects with the waist of a wasp and a deadly sting; predatory rivals and faction battles; exploring the farthest corners of the galaxy; dangerous challenges and responsible decisions.<br />Welcome to the world of CyberHive!<br />Commander, we are counting on you.",

        "description": "Devastator is a retro-inspired arcade twin-stick shooter designed for modern systems. Everything from the visuals to the audio to the gameplay was designed and tweaked and polished to create the most intense and satisfying twin-stick shooter experience possible.<br /><br />SYSTEM initializing...<br />Multiple virus infections detected...<br />Launching DEVASTATOR program...<br /><br />You are the Devastator! Your objective is to eradicate 15 types of viruses in 3 unique modes: Quadrants, Sectors, and Cycles. In Quadrants, the wave layout is constantly changing as you battle increasingly intense waves of random viruses for 5 minutes. In Sectors, there are 55 unique waves of viruses across 5 sectors. And in Cycles, you'll battle semi-randomized spawning viruses across 5 variations of 11 waves. Complete your objective as the Devastator and take back control of the System!<br /><br />In addition to the main game modes, wave layouts, and various enemy virus types providing gameplay variety, Devastator's moment-to-moment gameplay contains surprising depth and subtlety. From the way you balance speed vs. firepower to the utilization of resources to knowing when to pick up powerups, Devastator rewards both fast reflexes and good strategy.<br /><br />Devastator features vector-inspired visuals mixed with HDR colors, five customizable full-screen filters and mesmerizing particle effects, all while running at insanely high framerates on high-resolution monitors. With modern graphics hardware, the game runs with ease on current high-end gaming monitors (such as 360hz at 1080p, 240hz at 1440p, or 120hz at 4k), and it can theoretically run faster at higher resolutions when better monitors and higher-throughput video cables exist in the future.<br /><br />Devastator was designed and developed by Luke Schneider (aka the Radiangames guy). Luke has been a huge twin-stick shooter fan since the 1980s, and has been developing twin-stick shooters since 2005. With Devastator, Luke decided it was time to make his ultimate and final 2D arcade-style twin-stick shooter.<br /><br />Devastator features include:<br /><br />* Ultra-high resolution and ultra-high framerates support - 4k 120hz, 1440p 240hz, 1080p 360hz, etc. <br />* 3 different game modes - Quadrants, Sectors and Cycles, each with their own unique pacing and feel<br />* 15 unique virus types to battle against <br />* 55 unique waves across 5 sectors<br />* Powerful power-up drops<br />* Ever-changing wave layouts<br />* Ultra-satisfying twin-stick shooting gameplay - that rewards you for your mastery and variety of tactics<br />* Beautiful HDR, particle-laden graphics - with 5 unique filters and tons of customization options<br />* Heart-pounding soundtrack and intense retro-styled sounds that enhance your experience",

        "description": "From Santa Monica Studio and creative director Cory Barlog comes a new beginning for one of gaming's most recognizable icons. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.<br /><br />•\tBold New Beginning — His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. <br />•\tA Second Chance — Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.<br />•\tA Darker, More Elemental World — From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore God of War's breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise.<br />•\tVicious, Physical Combat — With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.",

Explore the environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep.<br /><br />But you don't have to rule alone! Introducing a cooperative play experience that is totally unique to Kingdom: Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a classic solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together locally or online, dropping in or out at will.<br /><br />In addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also includes:<br /><br />• Dead Lands: Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from Bloodstained the mythic demon horse “Gamigin” with its powerful charge attack. Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!<br /><br />• Shogun: Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.<br /><br />We will continue to keep the feeling of exploration, discovery, and strategy alive in Kingdom Two Crowns in post-release updates with more themed settings, each with unique styles that marvel the eye while changing how you rule the lands.<br /><br />A challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall reign stronger than one!",

Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.<br /><br />Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the ''interludes,'' which were originally published separately, available now on PlayStation 4 for the first time. Also for the first time, it has been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).",

Geese also makes an unexpected return as Nightmare Geese.<br /><br />In REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2 the system has been changed up a bit so that the 2nd line is mostly used for evasion and throwing your opponent. Three new characters are also included in this title: Li Xiangfei, Rick Strowd, and Alfred. The first two are new playable characters, while Alred is a secret boss.<br /><br />This title has been converted from the original PlayStation2 version to the PS4 system.

An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers.<br /><br />Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these \"flying soldiers\" can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these \"characters\", they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance.<br /><br />Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.<br /><br />It's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

        "description": "Not every game can be rated solely by screenshots. It's like a human's essence that can't be measured by a staged photo. And thus Glittering Sword is not that kind of game that some may think judging by screenshots or trailer. On the first glance it looks like typical action-adventure, like many other classic titles from the 90's. Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it's shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: «fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher. We hope that players who are addicted to adventure games will fall in love with this small but very entertaining game.",

With a hellish pawn shop of weirdly satisfying weapons – including Wet Fish, Cattle Prods, C4 and Guns – and a stack of Challenges to appease The Devil, becoming the most Infamous takes brains as well as looks.<br /><br />Get the band together for Party Setlists (Pass and Play) or try out ideas at your own pace in Sandbox mode.

        "description": "Fast & fluid arcade-style SHMUP meets hardcore roguelike! Take flight on a pimped-up jetboard and face off against massive, multi-stage bosses. A classic for the next generation!<br /><br />An intense, arcade-style, 'bullet hell' SHMUP/STG in which you must master a vast array of ridiculous weaponry in order to defeat a race of evil aliens who are intent on abducting innocent civilians and turning them into mutants. Jetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern roguelikes. Don't expect a story. Do expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced 60fps action, big guns, and explosions!<br /><br />The Jetboard: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock.<br /><br />The Enemies: Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game's weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too…<br /><br />The Weapons: From the conventional to the ridiculous! Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission! and leave a path of total destruction in your wake. Get up close and dish out massive damage with the shotgun, wreak havoc with the cluster bomb, fry enemies to a crisp with the flame tornado or shock them into submission with the lightning bolt. You'll get a different selection of weapons with each playthrough and you'll need to master them all!<br /><br />The Bosses: Defeat huge bosses in a series of grueling multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use. Rendered in exquisite pixel-art detail, these guys will test your weapon-handling and evasive maneuvering to their limits.<br /><br />The Planets: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons. Adapt your route based on your playstyle, the weapons you unlock and the treasure you discover. Plunder cash from fallen enemies and use it to pimp up your jetboard, jetsuit and max out your weapons for a formidable arsenal. Are you up to the challenge?",

        "description": "Lethal League Blaze is an intense, high speed ball game, with unique characters, outta sight sounds and none of that weak shit. In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect.<br /><br />In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online!<br /><br />Featuring<br /><br />Up to 4 players: Play locally AND online with up to 4 players.<br /><br />Easy to pick up, hard to master gameplay: Start off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts.<br /><br />Tons of unlockable extras and secrets: Unlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure.<br /><br />Play on your own: Step up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City.<br /><br />Modes and options:Pick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley...<br /><br />Wicked Tracks: A Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen.",

        "description": "Order of Battle: World War II is a turn-based strategy game with an impressive variety of scenarios and theatres of war. Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system.<br /><br />COMMANDERS<br /><br />A set of unique Commanders – split between Generals, Pilots and Captains – is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor.<br /><br />SUPPLY SYSTEM<br /><br />In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory.<br />THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED<br />The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941.<br />On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War.<br /><br />In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg.<br /><br />This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units.<br /><br />12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />Classic turn based, hex based gameplay with an intuitive UI and great depth.<br />Play in dynamic campaigns with unit carryover and multiple \"what-if\" scenarios.<br />A rich 3D world with detailed animations and effects<br />20 different Specializations give a unique feel to each faction including Banzai Charge, Bushido Code and even the Manhattan Project.<br />Over a thousand different unit types, including infantry, tanks, ships and aircraft, each with unique visuals and animations<br />Attach unique commanders to your units to give them additional offensive and defensive bonuses<br />A deep but intuitive supply system allowing breakthroughs & encirclements.",

Six infamous criminals stole the town's precious luck charms and it's up to you to bring them back. Get paid the golden price while doing so, because bounty hunters don't do charity work.<br /><br />Duck friend till the end – At all times you are accompanied by your companion Duckbridge. He returns your throwing knife, grabs extra health and distracts your enemies… but only when his tiny little duck brain tells him to do so.<br /><br />Key Features:<br />- Levels with different themes, unique elements and crazy boss characters.<br />- A completely unique luck mechanic that keeps the gameplay dynamic.<br />- Intense gun and knife throwing gameplay that will keep you on your toes.<br />- Music to pleasure your eardrums that fit the hip hoppy atmosphere of the game.<br />- A duck companion who's always by your side.<br />- Gambling!<br />- One-on-one pistol quick-draw duels.<br />- Converse with the nice townsfolk of Clovercreek.<br />- Hidden goldbars for the extra challenge.<br />- Bonus hip-hop tracks by various artists.",

Away from home, Donna seeks teenage thrills with her friends Becky and Vivek, but gets more than she bargained for when the trio become unexpected kidnappers in a game of amateur detective gone wrong.<br /><br />- John, an overworked middle-aged single dad. Burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent, John jealously pines after the free and easy life of his twenty-something bachelor neighbour, Jack. When the pair unwittingly fall foul of a vengeful stranger, a cursed artefact threatens to transform their lives forever.<br /><br />- Meena, a ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work. As Meena vies with an upstart colleague for a crucial promotion, something ancient stirs in the basement beneath her workplace.<br /><br />Last Stop is fully voice acted, featuring hours of dialogue and a voice cast of dozens, with performances from some of the brightest talent in the UK today, including Lulu Simpson as Molly Smith.<br /><br />Last Stop features an original soundtrack by BAFTA award winning composer Lyndon Holland, performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.<br /><br />Roleplay as 3 unique characters.

Confront the monster with your own sensitivity.<br /><br />This hand-drawn game can be completed in around one hour. The emotional music was composed by renowned film composer Juhana Lehtiniemi.<br /><br />DEVELOPED BY Platonic Partnership<br />“Our Finnish studio is focusing on narrative-driven games that motivate change. Lydia is someone who wishes for a happy childhood but can never have it. People with similar experiences will see this, so hopefully the game is really genuine and respectful.” – Henri Tervapuro, graphic novel artist and co-author of this self-inspired story.<br /><br />PUBLISHED BY Nakana.io<br />“We're proud to present games that share a strong experience to remember. ” – Mikaël Bourget, founder of the publishing label.",

        "description": "A mysterious signal has been recorded coming from the red planet.<br /><br />The message confounded Orochi scientists. Their analysts broke it down and determined it was of intelligent origin. Orochi management immediately concluded that the discovery was too sensitive for public knowledge and moved to keep it hidden. In secret, the corporation began construction of Trailblazer Alpha, a state-of-the-art Mars research outpost designed to identify the true nature of the message.<br /><br />You are Shane Newehart, an engineer stationed at Trailblazer Alpha and your security clearance means you are completely unaware of the existence of the mysterious signal. Your job is simply to keep the lights on until the transport ship Cyrano arrives bringing with it a new team to take over your duties.<br /><br />Soon you discover strange and unusual setbacks. Crucial systems are malfunctioning, the greenhouse is filled with a strange mist and the rest of your team has yet to return from their EVA mission. <br />Things are starting to fall apart.<br /><br />You begin seeing and hearing things that aren't there. Visions, hallucinations – or is that even what it is? Is this real… or are you slowly descending into madness?<br /><br />Experience true cosmic horror<br />With your only hope of rescue hundreds of thousands of miles away, you will be forced to explore the real-world fears of isolation and paranoia, enhanced with supernatural elements and cosmic horror. Terrifying visions and monstrous apparitions will make you question what is real and what is not as the very fabric of reality threatens to tear at the seams.<br /><br />Explore the darker side of Mars <br />Navigate a functioning Mars base in a game that uses non-fiction elements to immerse players in a believable setting. Overcome obstacles using computers, electrical systems, rovers, solar panels and more, then go beyond the outpost and explore the darker side of Mars.<br /><br />Moons of Madness draws upon the rich lore and mythology of Funcom's Secret World Legends. Both games exist in the same thematic universe, but playing one is not a prerequisite to enjoy the other.",

Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction.<br />Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons.<br />Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race.<br /><br />Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war.<br />Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.<br /><br />Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene!<br />Every corner of the game's environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games.<br /><br />Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next.<br /><br />For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored.<br />From enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

        "description": "Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again is a dynamic platformer with the elements of a rogue-lite, a combo system and special moves. The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won't be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character.<br /><br />Plot<br />The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King's daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter's hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King's blessing.  <br />The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. <br />The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose.<br /><br />• The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty. As you progress, you'll come across Easter eggs, things that'll crack you up and allusions to other games coupled with self-mockery<br /><br />• Randomly generated locations of items, artifacts, traps, rooms in the building, enemies and bosses<br /><br />• 12 characters, all with different performance and equipment<br /><br />• Customized equipment which can be upgraded with rocks, runes and enchantments<br /><br />• Secret features and tricks (e.g. get a firesword by plunging your sword into the lava)<br /><br />• Jaw-dropping action with various moves, skills and spells!<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console",

From hi-tech gadgets including drones and social media listening devices to hardboiled gumshoe methods like scaling buildings and tracking suspects in the city. No stronger evidence than catching a suspect in the act.<br /><br />FREEFORM COMBAT  <br />Master Yagami's three unique, combo-heavy martial arts styles to overcome any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Further weaponize street fights with traffic cones, street signs, bicycles and beyond, plus customize each style with skill trees.<br /><br />DEEP UNDERCOVER<br />Go undercover at a local high school as a club advisor to get to the root of a mysterious rise in delinquency as it relates to the case. Join the Dance Club, where you'll be grooving to the rhythm; the Robotics Club, tasking your ingenuity to build the ultimate Yagami-bot; a boxing gym, to stick and move against fierce opponents; and a bike gang, where underground racing is the only way to earn respect.<br /><br />HIT THE STREETS  <br />As you comb the open cities of Kamurocho and Ijincho in pursuit of the case, take a break and get to know the unique culture of each through bars and other nightlife hotspots. It may be worth taking on a Side Case to lend your detective skills to residents in need – you never know who holds what cards.",

        "description": "MAINFRAME DEFENDERS - tactical retrofuturistic strategy game. A computer virus has infiltrated the \"Stargazer\" research complex. Most of the robotic units are controlled by the virus. Lead a squad of 4 prototypes on a mission to defend complex mainframe. You'll have to repel assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and do more on your way to the deepest parts of the complex. Work with item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and return fire. But don't rely on a single strategy too much - enemies might have a way to counter it. But above everything else: defend the Mainframe!<br /><br />• RETRO STYLE: Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack.<br /><br />• DIVERSE TACTICS: Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets, eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind.<br /><br />• BUILD YOUR SQUAD: Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in MAINFRAME DEFENDERS you have to combine different items with unique abilities, to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build!<br /><br />• UNIQUE ENEMIES: Enemy squad won't sit idle, though. Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you will lose.<br /><br />• PROCEDURAL LEVELS: Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk falling behind?<br /><br />• PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Victory or defeat, the game is not over yet! Unlock new units, each with a unique set of upgrades and load-outs. Unlock new items to bolster your new strategies.<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console",

Then you came along. Together, you can get to the bottom of this…<br /><br />Sometimes life tests us. The main characters of these stories will face many challenges, whether it be the illness of someone you love, a perilous journey or walking away from an abusive relationship.

The City is not a physical place: It is beyond the dreams and the trip will definitely be hard and dangerous for our characters, who now have not only Nubla to achieve their goal but with many other characters and inhabitants of that world will be finding in their way.<br /><br />Nubla 2, as its predecessor, not only combines the narrative of the videogame and the concepts behind art and pictures in the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum, but rather to tell us much more: If the recurring theme in Nubla was the search for identity and memory, now the subject of borders, time and space, which makes us all refugees in a world that is no longer ours will be the main theme of Nubla 2.",

Don't rely on brute force solely! Sometimes you need to outsmart your enemy, not just outgun them with bullets.<br /><br />In the end of 2020 the worst thing in history of mankind has happened — gates of Hell has opened and let the hellish hordes of demons run wildly on Earth. For the hellspawns the human weapons was not much of a threat, just like peashooter versus elephant. It looked like the human race has no hope left for survival. But in the darkest hour the glimpse of hope, the ray of light appeared, and so it happened: the group of american scientists with Dr. Gusev as their lead scientist invented the special photon cannons, that can easily tear demon flesh apart. New photon weapons were installed on advanced tank models, created by Greenrunner Industries corporation. But there was a problem with tanks — they can be operated only by those who created it. These people were genius engineers of their time, but when they opposed the government they were imprisoned as war criminals. But facing the total destruction of all life on Earth the government decided to make a compromise. Now there is only one way for Travis Greenrunner and his people to get their freedom back — to drive away the demon scum to the place they crawled out from!",

Abducted, at the mercy of a ruthless scientist, and stalked by a horrible creature, you must try to escape using common sense, just as you would in real life. Can you get out of Oxide?<br /><br />It all starts when you wake up in the bathtub of a motel room, naked, wounded, and unsure what has happened. You remember that the deal had gone wrong, but now the only thing that matters is trying to escape from that horrifying place no matter what. From this moment on, everything you do will lead you to one of the endings. And we warn you that, out of all the ways it could end, there's only one good way out…<br /><br />There are many options and ways to solve situations, as well as different paths. Some actions will lead you to states that will alter your perception of the environment and even to an abrupt outcome. Remember that a bad decision can be the difference between life and death.<br /><br />• It's your choice! Matthew has gotten this far by making bad decisions. Decide carefully as your actions will affect how the game plays out and ends. It's up to you to get out of there alive… or not.<br /><br />• Interact with virtually anything as you would in real life. Search for resources, maps, clues, or something to defend yourself with. The Night Soul Motel is full of things you can use.<br /><br />• A shocking story. Getting out of there is not going to be an easy task and finding out WHAT OXIDE IS will be a challenge. Someone is playing with you, but what's behind all this?<br /><br />• Game over? Every time the character dies, either accidentally or at the hands of the motel's dangers, you will reappear in the bathtub of room 104, but everything has a price…<br /><br />• Great replayability. Your actions and decisions will affect the end of your adventure, so each game will be a challenge as you have many different options to explore.<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled",

        "description": "Easy to learn and rewarding to master, Petal Crash is a brand new puzzle game in the tradition of the arcade action puzzlers of the mid-90s. Like the games that inspired it, Petal Crash features a variety of single player challenges in addition to an intense head-to-head versus mode. The rules are simple - push a block in any direction, and it'll keep going until it hits a wall or another block. If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage!<br /><br />Enter the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire.<br /><br />Eons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia. Each of them has their own wish, and their own story to tell.<br /><br />Challenge the Story Mode to take your chosen character through their tale, challenging all the others in fierce puzzle battles to assemble all seven Sacred Blossoms! Shoot for high scores in Solo Play, racing the clock or rationing limited moves to get the highest rank you can! Solve puzzling brain-teasers with limited moves in the Puzzle Mode, and make your own puzzles in the Puzzle Editor! Challenge another player or fight the CPU in Versus Mode, racing to make clears and bury your opponent!<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

To restore balance to multiple dimensions, our videogame hero Dot recruits the help of the best gamer from 1995, an unassuming 9-year-old boy named David. Join this unlikely duo through challenging throwbacks to all your favorite classics from the late 16-bit and early 32-bit era of games inside a virtual reality world.<br /><br />The game evokes a genuine nostalgic feeling, such as the adrenaline of playing games without getting caught after your mom told you to go to bed, or the thrill of finding that brand new game at the store. You have to do all that and more through multiple environments - including your living room, bedroom, the local video rental store, the arcade at the pier, and more. With 6 fully original and highly differentiated levels, where each one feels like an entire new game, Pixel Ripped 1995 is an incredible journey for both VR and retro gamers.",

The Stanley Parable is a game that plays you.<br /><br />What's New?<br /><br />The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is an expanded re-imagining of the critically acclaimed, award winning indie game The Stanley Parable from 2013.<br /><br />Everything that was in the original Stanley Parable is here, preserved just like it was back in 2013. But The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe also dramatically expands the world of the original game with new content, new choices, and new secrets to uncover. The labyrinth has just gotten bigger.<br /><br />In addition, the game has been visually upgraded to reflect modern technology while faithfully preserving the tone of the original game. Accessibility features have also been added to the game, including localization of in-world text, colorblind options, and content warnings.<br /><br />And just as before, the impeccable voicework of Kevan Brighting will accompany you every step of the way.<br /><br />In The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, everything you remember has been recreated, yet it's different somehow. We've been here before, haven't we? Is Stanley still the same as he was back then? Or is it you who has changed?",

Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you!<br /><br />In the course of each case, you'll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimonies, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn't be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn't shout “OBJECTION!” when you know you've got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution's claims and prove your client's innocence.<br /><br />The game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease! Will you be able to crack these clever cases? The game is afoot!<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

        "description": "Tails of Iron now includes ‘Bloody Whiskers': a free expansion which introduces a new post-game questline, two additional difficulty modes, five new bosses, a selection of special armours and weapons, and a secret that was perhaps better left forgotten…<br /><br />Set in a grim land plagued by war, Tails of Iron is a hand-drawn RPG Adventure with punishingly brutal combat. As Redgi, heir to the Rat Throne, you must restore your broken Kingdom by banishing the merciless Frog Clan and their ferocious leader, Greenwart. As you explore the deceivingly charming world, you'll encounter a cast of unique companions, ready to aid you in your adventure. And you'll need all the help you can get, whether that's new meal recipes, blueprints to forge deadly weapons and armour, or even a land-chugging, armour-plated mole mobile! Overcome your fears. Rescue your brothers. Restore Your Kingdom. Your tail has begun…<br /><br />Master Brutal Combat<br />From frog zombies to gargantuan grubs - and everything in-between - the Kingdom is awash with danger. To overcome each perilous encounter, you'll need to study your opponent's attacks and react accordingly! Thankfully, there's a range of deadly abilities at your disposal, including parry bashes and fatal executions, not to mention ranged attacks with your nifty bow and arrow.<br /><br />Explore a Treacherous Kingdom<br />Fully accompanied by the deep, raspy narrations of Doug Cockle, prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the mediaeval-fantasy Rat Kingdom. Complete side quests and faction hunts for some additional gold-on-the-side, or join forces with a sharp-eyed companion to help even the playing field.<br /><br />Customise your Attack<br />Adapt Redgi's combat style to the task at hand. Heavy armour may provide better protection but can you really afford to slow down your dodge-roll? And then there's the question of weapon; axes pack a punch, while spears are quick and nimble. Perhaps you'd prefer the all-round performance of a trusty broadsword?<br /><br />Overcome Savage Boss Fights<br />While danger lurks around every toadstool, you'll need to keep your wits sharp and your blade sharper when it comes to the devastating boss fights. Cold-blooded in every sense of the word, these oversized amphibians each present their own unique combat challenge, and you'll need more than a good set of armour to come out on top.<br /><br />Brew Recipes, Craft Weapons, Forge Armour<br />Redgi's keep is also home to his brothers, Rem-Rem, Bam-Bam and Dug. Rem can cook up a health-boosting feast with ingredients found throughout the world, while Bam can craft new weapons and armors from special blueprints you'll uncover… if you look hard enough. And then there's Dug, who'll update you about new quests available throughout the Kingdom.<br /><br />Features:<br />- Master brutal combat, inspired by the souls-like genre, featuring dodge-rolls, parry bashes, and fatal executions!<br />- Explore a vast and treacherous Kingdom, comprising six distinct biomes, each with its own hidden paths and secrets.<br />- Immerse yourself in the compelling story, narrated by the deep, raspy Doug Cockle. <br />- Customise your attack style with a vast array of distinct weapons and armour.<br />- Assemble a band of brave companions, ready to aid you on select missions.<br />- Complete side quests to earn additional gold-on-the-side.<br />- Unearth special blueprints to forge new and powerful weapons.<br />- Collect rare ingredients to cook up health-boosting feasts.<br />- Overcome savage boss fights against the Frog Clan's deadly, oversized generals.<br />- Lose yourself in the gorgeous and lovingly-crafted 2D hand-drawn art style.<br /><br />This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.",

        "description": "Sheepo is a quirky metroidvania platformer featuring a shape-shifting sheep-thing, who must traverse an uncharted planet in order to collect samples of each living species for an intergalactic species database.<br /><br />To capture a creature, Sheepo must find their unhatched egg, which happen to be highly guarded by that species \"queen\" (aka, a boss.) With each egg Sheepo collects, you then gain the ability to transform into that creature on contact, and explore the deeper reaches of the planets sprawling environment<br /><br />Sheepo is a metroidvania, but contains no standard combat. Instead, gameplay is based on platforming and exploration. With the collection of each creature, Sheepo is able to dig, fly, and teleport across an interconnected series of landscapes, uncovering hidden shrines, old ruins, and strange characters.<br /><br />Features:<br />-Tight platforming with variety. Play as both Sheepo, and the variety of creatures you come in contact with. Gameplay remains fresh as you consistently learn the moves of each creature<br />-Traverse a sprawling landscape with tons of hidden rooms and characters. Explore old mines, an abandoned mall, lush forests, the dingy sewer system, and much more.<br />-75+ hidden feathers to collect (the planets currency), which can be spent at the last remaining shop in DeadMall.<br />-Non-linear gameplay. Sheepo begins somewhat linearly, but the map quickly opens up to allow you to make your own route.<br /><br />This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.",

Use special tools to find each tank, and extract it from the ground. Grow your repair service business and start your own tank museum.<br /><br />Start the engine of a newly renovated tank, and feel its former power!<br />Use different tools to work on tanks:<br />- Rust Removal Tool<br />- Sand Blaster<br />- Paint Gun<br />- Hammer<br />- Grinder - to cut and grind<br />- Wrench pistol - to quickly disassemble rusted screws/bolts<br /><br />Experience the full process of renovation:<br />- Clean the tank from mud<br />- De-rust the tank<br />- Sandblast the tank<br />- Apply primer paint to the tank<br />- Apply final paint to the tank (factory paint)<br />- Add custom paint, camouflage, color, decal in the paint room<br />- Sell the tank or put it in your museum to gain money and reputation<br /><br />Take a tank apart<br />Use tools and take each tank apart. You can disassemble tank exterior parts, from the bottom (wheels and tracks) up to the turret (gun, barrel, gun cradle etc.). Additionally, the interior of the tank is also available to be renovated, the crew space, tank engine and tank drive system.<br /><br />Take a seat inside the tank, as any of its crew. From here you can have better and easier access to the interior parts of the tank. Repair hatches, viewers, ammo holders, drive control components and gearbox parts.<br /><br />To start the tank, you need to repair its engine, gearbox and fuel system. Take the engine out and move it to a special engine stand, to be able to interact with it. Make sure the fuel, coolant and oil systems are assembled and the fluids are filled, so the tank engine can be put to test.<br /><br />High focus on details<br />Our tanks and vehicles are based on construction documents, expert opinions and insights from top II World War museums. Our goal is to give a fun and realistic simulation experience of building and repairing these legendary machines.<br /><br />Customize the tank as you wish, use different camouflages, paint colors, decals etc.<br />Find and extract tanks<br />One of the ways to obtain a tank is to get it during the extraction mission. After finding the spot where the tank is underground, call for the excavation team. Prepare the tank for extraction, by pumping the mud out of the tank and then cleaning the tank from whatever's left. Finally, order the lifting of the tank onto the truck trailer, to finish the mission, and move the tank into the workshop.<br /><br />Test your renovated tanks<br />Go on the training ground, check how your tank is dealing with special obstacles. Get inside the tank, start the engine and drive around to see if everything is working correctly.<br /><br />You can also take the tank to the proving grounds, where you are able to shoot the tank's armament on a special shooting range. You can use two different camera modes for better control of the tank.",

Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock's quest for truth.<br /><br />As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.<br /><br />Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It's time to confront your past so you can become the legend you're destined to be.<br /><br />KEY PILLARS<br /><br />The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you'll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We've never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you're living it.<br /><br />Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace.<br /><br />And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there's something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean.<br /><br />A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really?<br /><br />A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult.<br /><br />Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It's up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you'll become.",

Hans walked into the forest in search of adventure. Soon it was night and the boy was really scared, so he tried to go back. But then, a quaint kobold happened to cross his path and Hans decided to follow him to a castle. The kobold told him he would inherit great wealth if he passed a simple trial... guessing his name.

        "description": "Tannenberg brings the massive battles of the Eastern Front in WW1 to life with 40 players fighting for control of key sectors of the battlefield, each one offering a distinct strategic advantage. Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike.<br /><br />There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series.<br /><br />This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians.<br /><br />Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields.<br /><br />It's all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive – lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Just make sure you don't get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies!<br /><br />The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front), with a new game Isonzo coming soon with mountain warfare on the Italian Front! These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references.<br /><br />**Cross play supported between console platforms.**",

In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming 8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he takes on hordes of zombies let loose upon the world.<br /><br />Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne.  Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.<br /><br />Protect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic's epic story.<br /><br />The Escapists. © 2015.

I'm sure that every one of you saved the world from them for so many times he can't even count and brought peace to one or another planet. All these pesky alien invaders love to attack and capture anything they can reach their hands to. This was earlier, this happens now and believe me it'll happen again in the future.<br /><br />In Rusty Gun the aliens are confronted not by some over-muscled macho, fan of bubblegum, not some secret organzation dressed in black, and not even chickenpox. This time the defender of Earth and his own private peace appears to be some casual grouchy old Earthling, who was hurt by aliens that spoiled his favorite fishing leisure by scaring all the fish away. Without any hesitation old man picked up his old and rusty rifle with only one goal — to show the alien invaders that there idea of having Earth destroyed while he has fishing full on his hands — the worst possible idea.<br /><br />Explore the locations infested by alien dirtbags, keep finding secrets and new types of bullets for your rifle. Remember that the whole destiny of mankind is in your hands, and don't forget that you're just old, grumpy and love to kill.",

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality.<br /><br />In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.<br /><br />Features:<br />• Survive the horror using adventure mechanics and exploration.<br />• Experience a beautiful, erotic hand-painted art style with Eastern and Western influences.<br />• Unlock additional outfits, some of which alter interactions throughout the game.<br />• Keep track of the immersive lore with a convenient journal feature.<br />• Discover multiple New Game+ modes, alternate endings and hidden extras!<br />• Get in the mood with a visceral cinema-length soundtrack.<br /><br />PS Vita: One time license fee entitles play on up to 3 PlayStation Vita systems activated by this account.",

About love as fuel, the force that drives us.<br /><br />Love is a universal feeling, but each of us experiences it in a different way. Solo – Islands of the Heart explores the theme of love in an introspective way, allowing players to identify and reflect on their own experiences.<br /><br />The world is divided into archipelagos, with each island representing a unique puzzle. Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.<br /><br />As with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island.<br /><br />Nature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.",

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers.<br /><br />History: <br />In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk.  In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.<br /><br />Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!<br /><br />TD features: <br />- Shop system for buying and improving towers and for purchasing special weapons <br />- 9 defense towers, capable of improvement (2 improvements each within a battle)<br />- Support towers, special attacks and elements that can be placed along the path <br />- Unique opponents - 54 unlockable maps  + 9 bonus maps <br />- Tower control (control of direction and aim of a tower) <br />- Power-up for each tower: damage, rate of fire, range <br />- can be placed along the path: mine, adhesive cream fence, block wall <br />- Supporters: fire power expansion, range expansion <br />- Global help: area bomb, atomic bomb, air support",

You find yourself outnumbered and outgunned against an invasion of corrupted enforcement machines. You must fight your way through the Copper Canyon to rid it of this evil robot horde!<br /><br />The core of the game is extremely fast and frenetic. The player must progress through one of three arcade levels. In each level the player must face relentless waves of enemies which spawn around the environment in progressively more challenging waves. Enemies will dynamically take cover, charge or attack independently.<br /><br />The player is encouraged to continually move from cover to cover whilst laying down as much fire as possible, giving the game a real Wild West shoot-out atmosphere. Each path leads to an open arena where the player must face a final boss which will present different challenges depending on the chosen level and must be defeated in stages.<br /><br />PlayStationVR Required<br /><br />2 PSMove controllers required<br /><br />The Copper Canyon Shoot Out, the Copper Canyon franchise, and representative logos are owned by, and copyright of, Black Dragon Studios Ltd.

No dialogue or text means that you can share moments of time with the characters and create your interpretations. Though the experience is short (under 3 hours) The Longest Road on Earth allows you to wrap yourself like a cozy blanket in the beauty of small joys like blowing dandelion seeds, collecting seashells, sledding on the first day of winter, and riding a bike on a summer day.<br /><br />THE QUIET, SIMPLE MOMENTS<br /><br />In The Longest Road on Earth, there are no challenges to tarnish the experience, no fail-states to punish you.

        "description": "Unravel the mystery of a missing cardinal by solving the riddle of a demonic power you did not expect to come upon. Face your inner demons and fight the power of evil while it seduces your soul. Play as the wittiest, pop-culture referencing priest in video game history and face an ultimate game over, if you make the angels cry you a river.<br /><br />The Padre is a retro stylised 3D horror adventure game tapping deep into the roots of classic horror games. The dark and striking atmosphere is often cut by the wicked humour of the always witty Padre. You will need to use your brains to solve challenging puzzles, as well as your brawns to fend off monsters, all at the same time while you try to unravel the mysteries of the mansion, yourself and the eternal fight between good and evil. Be weary though, if you fail enough times it's a permanent GAME OVER for you!",

        "description": "while True: learn() is a puzzle/simulation game about even more puzzling stuff: machine learning, neural networks, big data and AI. But most importantly, it's about understanding your cat.<br /><br />In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it's you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system.<br /><br />This game fits best for...<br />- People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work<br />- Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids<br />- Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding<br />- Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about ‘wasting their time' (although we believe you shouldn't feel guilty at all while playing games!)<br />- Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun<br />- Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it<br />- People who like smart cats<br /><br />Learn how machine learning works in real life!<br /><br />The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don't worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required!<br /><br />Train yourself into a data science wizard!<br /><br />Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen.<br /><br />Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist!<br /><br />Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you'll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That's what real data scientists do!<br /><br />Coding just got real!<br /><br />Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it's your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right?<br /><br />Improve your gear, improve your life!<br /><br />Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you'll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it's not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe!<br /><br />Fun fact: this is what machine learning specialists actually do. Now, you can become one of them (minus the money)! while True: learn() is the best game about being a data science specialist because no one else has been weird enough to make another one!<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

        "description": "Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle.<br /><br />The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium.<br /><br />The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with.<br /><br />Battle your way across no man's land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn't for the faint hearted!<br /><br />Looking for more WW1 action? Check out Tannenberg for Eastern Front maneuver warfare, or the upcoming Isonzo for Italian mountain warfare!",

        "description": "\"Welcome to an old, ruined train station. A place that will give you a lot of fun!<br /><br />In Train Station Renovation you play as a renovation company specialised in restoring railway stations. The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into 15 maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life.<br /><br />Choose how hard you want to work.<br />The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage.<br /><br />Quick and easy access to equipment is the key to success.<br />There are many tools and options for repairing and decorating the station. Work with basic items such as paint rollers, spray cans, crowbars and repair wrenches or use your in-game tablet to order new materials and items. Some stations will even allow you to repair and renovate the old trains. This means you will be able to take care of the technical condition of those vehicles yourself.<br /><br />Specializations development tree<br />An aesthetic development character tree t is available. You will speed up your work time at individual stages and elements of the game by upgrading your skills. You will also get new equipment or unlock new options while renovating. If you happen to enjoy some renovation activities more than others, you will be able to upgrade them during your playthrough.<br /><br />Renovate and decorate train stations and trains.<br />Detailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements.<br /><br />The economy is very important<br />A complex economy aspect has been added to the game to increase realism. In addition to money needed to buy new items and repair materials, you can also benefit by segregating waste or completing additional tasks.<br /><br />Build your own station.<br />Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station.\"",

Solve the riddles and mysteries that angered the old Gods, on your quest to prevent history from repeating itself forever.<br /><br />Secrets of the Minoan Cataclysm. In 1639 BC a powerful explosion devastated the Minoan civilization and sunk the birthplace of their empire: the volcanic island of Thera.

Hidden in the depths for several millennia, the island of Thera is full of historical treasures to collect and mysteries to decipher. Discover a lost Minoan citadel, open your way through an ottoman sunken fleet and unlock the doors to underground palace, as you uncover the details about the folk who lived there and their tragic fate.

Marie Taylor is the hero of the story, a brilliant treasure hunter who works with her associate, historian James Andrew, seeking out ancient relics.
