The World Large, procedurally generated and interconnected lands range from plains, to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area\u2019s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items. One must choose carefully though; every god has a different price and some become displeased when their rival is the subject of worship. Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians.

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn\'t required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don\'t worry if you don\'t know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rogue-bit-switch/hero","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"60%","Price":"4.99","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","SalePrice":"1.99","MexPrice":"39.99"},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2021-12-03","Title":"Rock \'N Racing Bundle Off Road & Grand Prix","LowestPrice":"3.99","SaleStarted":"2021-11-14","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia. Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds. Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay.

Eighties of the twentieth century. The golden age of 8-bit video games. We were leaving school, and we were going to spend our precious coins in the arcade machines. One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari\'s Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t want to be better than Asteroids; that\'s impossible. What we want is to make a tribute. And that\'s all we want. We have added some aspects, besides the famous UFO: a demon, and some enemy ships that launch rockets to destroy us. Main features are: Features.

Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it\u2019s shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: \xabfantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles\xbb. Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher.

Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction.<br />Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons.<br />Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race.<br /><br />Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war.<br />Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.<br /><br />Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene!<br />Every corner of the game\'s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games.<br /><br />Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal.

Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?<br /><br />If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode!<br /><br />Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you\'ve mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play.<br /><br />You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it\'s close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type.<br /><br />The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it. Get your name up there and challenge your friends!<br /><br />The only question that remains is: what\'s outside the room?<br /><br />PlayStation\xa0VR headset compatible<br />PlayStation\xa0Camera compatible<br />Enhanced play with 2 PlayStation\xa0Move motion controllers<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202104/0210/o03fnVnzmBMW2v62ov49x5fw.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/breathedge-playstation","PercentOff":"40%","PlusPrice":14.99,"Price":24.99,"Publisher":"HYPETRAIN DIGITAL LTD","ReleaseDate":"2021-04-06","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-11 07:59:00","SalePrice":14.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:17","Slug":"breathedge-playstation","Title":"Breathedge","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4416-CUSA26770_00-5029723546049722","description":"Survive in outer space!

Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.<br /><br />The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.<br /><br />What\'s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\'ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.<br /><br />They don\'t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\'ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\'t happen but marketing text is hard to write.","genre":"Action,Platformer","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB E10-T","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP4491/CUSA01037_00/murHNPj3G2JBa7CXX3Uup8qiD5d3BFwQ.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/surgeon-simulator-ae--i-am-bread-playstation","PercentOff":"80%","PlusPrice":3.99,"Price":19.99,"Publisher":"BOSSA STUDIOS LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-26","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":3.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:11:48","Slug":"surgeon-simulator-ae--i-am-bread-playstation","Title":"Surgeon Simulator A&E + I Am Bread","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4491-CUSA01037_00-SSBREAD000000001","description":"2 unique games linked by a shared universe and distinctive humour!

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike.<br /><br />There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series.<br /><br />This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians.<br /><br />Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields.<br /><br />It\'s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive \u2013 lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment.<br /><br />Tannenberg\'s Maneuver game mode captures the essence of warfare on the Eastern Front, with 40 players, large open maps, and the freedom to choose which sectors you will attack and defend. Just make sure you don\'t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies!<br /><br />The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front). These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines.<br /><br />We recreate the atmosphere of the Eastern Front with the same level of accuracy as seen in Verdun. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references.

There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium.","genre":"Action,First-Person","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/1423/BF9LompUaSdQBcInmWif53Ut.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-main-game-and-dlc-pack-playstation","PercentOff":"50%","PlusPrice":14.99,"Price":29.99,"Publisher":"SEGA of America, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-01","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-11 07:59:00","SalePrice":14.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:13","Slug":"virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-main-game-and-dlc-pack-playstation","Title":"Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown Main game and DLC Pack","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-CUSA27065_00-9558212560709500","description":"This is a bundle of the main game \u201cVirtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown\u201d and DLC \u201cLegendary Pack\u201d that includes the DLC.

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality.<br /><br />In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.<br /><br />Features:<br />\u2022 Survive the horror using adventure mechanics and exploration.<br />\u2022 Experience a beautiful, erotic hand-painted art style with Eastern and Western influences.<br />\u2022 Unlock additional outfits, some of which alter interactions throughout the game.<br />\u2022 Keep track of the immersive lore with a convenient journal feature.<br />\u2022 Discover multiple New Game+ modes, alternate endings and hidden extras!<br />\u2022 Get in the mood with a visceral cinema-length soundtrack.<br /><br />PS Vita: One time license fee entitles play on up to 3 PlayStation Vita systems activated by this account.","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/0214/y3CRZCHFZCfc3kIiO1Jutsha.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":1,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/shing-playstation","PercentOff":"50%","PlusPrice":4.99,"Price":19.99,"Publisher":"Mass Creation","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-18","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":9.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 07:10:18","Slug":"shing-playstation","Title":"Shing!","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4396-PPSA02957_00-SHINGGAME0000002","description":"Experience the most exciting and immersive beat-em-up combat system ever \u2013 become a kickass ninja and slice some demons in style!

Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages.<br /><br />The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible.<br /><br />Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.<br /><br />As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.<br /><br />A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre.

You\'ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn\'t even bear imagining.<br /><br />Storyline<br />This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\'ll soon wish you could join the dead\'s ranks in their abyss, but death won\'t help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows?<br /><br />Dark entities<br />The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\'ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own.<br /><br />Gameplay<br />In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You\'ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it.<br /><br />Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you\'ll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Teen","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307TQRuBkpEMNOSz7zNpepxSnIwkP0iamqNnaacfTfBj7kFSUyAe-ROlMIOT8n7IMm9wjySg0gTBeQ--gWxbG3Mssn8pXS.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/waltz-of-the-wizard-extended-edition-playstation","PercentOff":"60%","PlusPrice":3.99,"Price":9.99,"Publisher":"Aldin Dynamics, ehf.","ReleaseDate":"2019-08-27","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":3.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 07:10:53","Slug":"waltz-of-the-wizard-extended-edition-playstation","Title":"Waltz of the Wizard: Extended Edition","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1452-CUSA16931_00-WOTWEE2019PSVR01","description":"Waltz of the Wizard is a virtual reality experience that lets you feel what it is like to have magical powers.
