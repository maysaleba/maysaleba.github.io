"82","2025-03-26","Immerse yourself in a dramatic yet charming and witty world of evidence-gathering, deduction and courtroom battles with this double-pack of the adventures of rookie lawyer Ryunosuke. Set in late 19th century Japan and London, each title features five murder-mystery episodes filled with all the drama, laughs, twists and “turnabouts” you’ve come to expect from the legally labyrinthine legacy of Ace Attorney. Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you! In the course of each case, you’ll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimony, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn’t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn’t shout “OBJECTION!” when you know you’ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution’s claims and prove your client’s innocence. The game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease! Will you be able to crack these clever cases? The game is afoot!","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/1207/stJIF1yVqivr1P3NoKwrsbRt.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0102-CUSA17892_00-GAAT12FULLGAME00","60%","0","Adventure","113.6","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-great-ace-attorney-chronicles","The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles","TRD","CE EUROPE LIMITED","2021-07-26","the-great-ace-attorney-chronicles-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","284.01","0","113.60","1","",

"79","2025-03-26","Rise of the Third Power is a love letter to the glory days of the console style RPG, loosely based on the political climate of Europe in the late 1930's, with modern conveniences such as auto-save and a combination of the best elements of Japanese and Western style gameplay. The story takes place in the land of Rin during the height of the Age of Sail, following the events that would lead to the greatest war in human history. STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin. POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history. CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle. PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total. This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3919-CUSA28518_00-R3PEU00000000000","40%","0","Adventure, Role Playing Games","349.5","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/rise-of-the-third-power","Rise of the Third Power","TRD","DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","2022-02-09","rise-of-the-third-power-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","419.40","1","",

INVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP Invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation. TENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER Customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode. ENHANCED KILL CAM More realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.","2025-03-11","/game/101756","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2116/59jHCjMBRhuRhPUKUUy2gkNd.png?w=200","10","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4529-PPSA04444_00-SNIPERELITE50000","75%","40","Fighting, Action","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/sniper-elite-5","Sniper Elite 5","TRD","REBELLION DEVELOPMENTS LTD","2022-05-25","sniper-elite-5-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","20","524.75","1","",

"76","2025-03-26","Ink and blood stain the streets of Ramezia. Witches must burn and sins must be judged. Venture forth as Sister Semilla to burn down the pillars of heresy in Minoria, an action-platformer by the creators of Momodora. The story takes place during the fourth Witch War. It is a time of fanatical religious fervor. The Sacred Office, a powerful organization leading an Inquisition against heresy, purges the sinners who threaten humanity. Those responsible for conducting a mysterious ceremony that contradicts the rules of the Church are labeled “witches.” Now, Sisters Semilla and Fran, missionaries in the Church’s service, set out to thwart the witches’ ceremony and protect the common-folk from heresy that endangers the status quo. Minoria is the latest and most ambitious game from Bombservice and a spiritual sequel to the Momodora series. Fans of Momodora will find familiar aspects in the design and gameplay elements, as they master the ins-and-outs of parries, dodges, and a variety of different spells. Now in HD format, with aesthetics mixing 2D hand-painted backgrounds and cel-shaded characters, Minoria continues Bombservice’s legacy on consoles.

"75","2025-03-26","Frank and Drake is the modern gothic tale that puts players at the heart of a supernatural mystery through its non-linear branching paths, mini-games and puzzles, and unique rotoscoped art. Take your time, explore and soak up every word. Two extraordinary strangers Frank and Drake are two extraordinary strangers brought together by unknown forces in a conspiracy that threatens them both. Sharing the same apartment, though destined never to meet, they must work together to uncover the mystery shrouding both their existences. Frank is the super of a run-down apartment block in Oriole City, worried he is losing his mind and what little remains of his connection to the world around him. Drake is allergic to sunlight and operates by night. Both experience visions and have unanswered questions about their pasts. Could the answers they seek be in these mysterious experiences? Their split existence means they must communicate via sticky notes left around the apartment. Despite this separation they must forge a relationship, uncover the mystery and survive. One compelling conspiracy Play both characters alternately: Frank during the day, Drake at night. What choices they make will affect what the other can do in the future. Though they must work separately, their fates are intertwined and depend on the trust and friendship they forge together. The game is set in Oriole City, a richly detailed and beautifully illustrated setting, full of mystery, remarkable characters, and secrets to unearth. Frank and Drake must explore these surroundings, solve puzzles and discover clues that will help them find the answers they desperately seek, to their respective troubled pasts. What choices will you make? The mystery unfolds via a branching narrative, where the choices you make will have a profound impact on the events Frank and Drake experience. Multiple playthroughs will be rewarded with the discovery of new perspectives on the story, as well as unique puzzles and mini-games. Which path will you choose? Will you discover all the secrets hidden in the world? Frank and Drake employs a beautiful graphical style that represents the unnerving and dreamlike existence that both characters feel with the world around them. The rotoscoping style is a painstaking process of hand drawing frames over filmed footage. The uncanny result reflects Frank and Drake’s realities: two extraordinary characters trying to blend into an ordinary world.","2025-03-11","/game/92574","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2208/2083cfe9751446703e5158250d4caf57eb456fc4474696b9.png?w=200","2","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5438-PPSA09560_00-9082029541397054","25%","0","Adventure","336.75","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/frank-and-drake","Frank and Drake","TRD","Chorus Worldwide Games","2023-07-19","frank-and-drake-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","449.00","11","336.75","1","",

"74","2025-03-26","Gord is a dark-fantasy, adventure-strategy game set in a hostile, forsaken land inspired by Slavic mythology. Besieged by vile creatures, you must build to survive. But to prevail, you must conquer the darkness beyond the gates. On the orders of the King, you are charged with striking out to make your mark on an untamed world—building and growing settlements in the face of resistance from raiders, monsters and more. Take command of the Tribe of the Dawn and embrace the ethical complexity of leadership as you shepherd the community — their safety and sanity are your responsibility. Protect them from hunger, disease and trauma. Nurture their faith and train them for battle. In return, they will pledge their loyalty and lay down their lives.

"69","2025-03-26","Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes. Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled—this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these—and more—to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience—a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0102-CUSA24163_00-MAKAIRE000000001","67%","0","Action","346.17","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection","Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection","TRD","CE EUROPE LIMITED","2021-05-31","ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","346.17","1","",

Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages. The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him – but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible. Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences. As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them – and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain. A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre.

"67","2025-03-26","This product now includes access to the non-VR edition Cave Digger 2 for no extra charge! Start with a pickaxe in one hand and nothing in the other. Excavate the bedrock, reap the rewards of Mother Earth, and trade the mined valuables for new gadgets, travels, funky wild fashion, and more. Cave Digger 2: Dig Harder is a 1-4-player VR action-adventure game set in wildland valleys, where you discover old mines, nautical caves, and ruins of ancient civilizations inspired by Western, Dieselpunk and Lovecraftian themes. Explore the ""pristine"" lands, loot its riches, and unravel the mystery linked to a great explorer. As you go, it's best to keep a six-shooter nearby just in case. Tools and Progression Get thrown right away into the deep end by being stuck in the mines as your drill machine broke. With a single pickaxe, work your way to the surface camp where your journey can begin in earnest. Your goal is simply to mine and carry loot back to the surface the best you can for your mission assigners. With the surplus reward that you get, you can buy new things like upgrading your dependable pickaxe with a shinier look! (And faster digging rate.) Or buy dynamites that work on pretty much anything that needs to be worked on. Maybe you fancy a shovel that works for both digging and moving through the caves like a spider-miner. Whatever your preferred loadout, you will be ready to go deeper into the ever-shifting caves than any miner before or after you! Story The valleys have their mysteries and they hide them well. Step by step the player follows the same path where a great explorer has once wandered. Who is this hardy explorer? Why did he come to these valleys? And where is he now? The answers to these and more lie in the depths of the valleys. The story has multiple endings, each revealing a different side of it. Find the scattered comic pages to a tale of greed, eldritch power, and secrets beyond space and time. Who the wanderer is and why he did what he did in the valleys become clear in the end. But is it really the end? Co-op Multiplayer Gather a party of up to 4 players. Your role in the mining team is totally up to you! As long as at least somebody is carrying their weight in gold back to the surface, you all get paid in official Merchant Dollars equally. Co-op crossplay supports public matchmaking and private groups, and you are very free to show your wildlands drip by combining from a generous selection of clothes, hats and faces once you've bought them first! So, take a pickaxe (and your friends) with you and head to the wildlands for the riches it holds, find out the secrets it contains, and dig deeper into the valleys than any adventurer before or after you! For the latest updates, exclusive sneaky-peeks, and 24/7 Saloon talks (memes),ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿ step into our Discord community -> discord.gg/cavedigger Features – Discoveries, dangers and digging – Mine your way with the dependable pickaxe, versatile dynamites, hi-tech hammer, and more! – Procedurally generated partially destructible cave and mine networks – Grab the six-shooter, chain-shovel, and the gold-pan-turned-to-a-shield if things get rough.

ÃƒÂ¢—† Introduction The protagonist wakes up and finds himself in a hospital bed. He can neither move his hands nor his legs after a sudden car accident. Now he has no choice but to rely on the nurses to do anything. In a normal hospital, there would have been no problem... But little did he know that the hospital he was taken to was a haven for mischievious nurses...

Taking advantage of this, the girls begin to play around with him...!! He cannot stand up for himself against these approaching girls, nor is he allowed to run away. Will Sho be able to survive until he is discharged from the hospital? But why would he possibly want to leave this heavenly place in the first place... ÃƒÂ¢—† Characters ÃƒÂ£Ã†’Ã‚Â»Rinko Yamamura ""You're blushing. I guess Sho is also a man."" A ""ruthless and sadistic"" female doctor. She is an excellent doctor, but has a thing for cute boys.

"","2025-03-26","Make yourself comfortable, put on your headphones, and get ready to conquer cyberspace! HexaScape: Cyber Defense is an addictive mix of hex grid puzzler and tower defense mechanics, creating a compelling turn-based strategy game. - Board game-like mechanics - If you know the board game classic Carcassonne, you’ll instantly feel at home in HexaScape. Players determine the course of the game by placing hexagon tiles: they explore cyberspace, expand the influence of the cyber core, and build a defense line with towers that can be strengthened and upgraded by power clusters. As you increase the core’s reach, virus spawners will appear. They spawn viruses and grow stronger with each wave – unless you manage to disable them. Each run feels different: The more you expand into cyberspace, the more abilities the viruses can take on, testing your ability to constantly adapt to new game conditions. - Build unique towers - Cyber towers are your only defence against viruses. Place them wisely, buff them with power fields, upgrade them with new abilities by completing quests, and use skill points to customize them to your needs. - Explore cyberspace - By placing the hex tiles, you explore cyberspace, encountering six different biomes, many different events, and virus bosses hidden on the generator tiles. There’s a campaign with predefined scenarios, an endless mode with procedurally generated maps, maps of the week, and user-generated maps for nearly endless fun! - Create your own maps - Create custom maps for new challenges with the powerful editor! Determine where biomes, event fields, and boss fields are located, and add your own story. Play your maps yourself or share them with the community.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202407/0412/1f39ee7b0defff8d903191f865d9dde48a34893594bcafef.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8073-PPSA24763_00-HEXASCAPECD00000","20%","0","Puzzle, Strategy, Strategy","393.75","null","null","HexaScape: Cyber Defense","TRD","Clockwork Origins","2025-01-29","hexascape-cyber-defense-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","420.00","0","",

Wield an arsenal of powerful weapons as you battle demon hordes on Mars, on Earth, and across Hell in six critically acclaimed games. DOOM + DOOM II Developed by id Software, and originally released in 1993, DOOM pioneered and popularized the first-person shooter, setting a standard for all FPS games. The critically acclaimed sequel, DOOM II, followed in 1994. Now the definitive, newly enhanced versions of DOOM + DOOM II are available as a combined product. DOOM 64 In this enhanced version of DOOM 64, years have passed since you stopped Hell’s invasion of Earth. Quarantined for humanity’s safety, the UAC research facilities on Mars were abandoned and forgotten...until now. A signal from a degraded satellite suggests a single entity remains, and it has the power to resurrect the demons. As the only surviving marine who fought Hell’s forces, you are sent on a lone crusade to hunt down the Mother of Demons and stop a renewed demonic invasion. DOOM 3 A demonic invasion has overwhelmed the Union Aerospace Corporation's Mars research facility. As one of only a few survivors, you must fight your way to hell and back against a horde of demons in this award-winning horror/action FPS and reimagining of the original DOOM. DOOM (2016) Developed by id software, the studio that pioneered the first-person shooter genre and created multiplayer Deathmatch, DOOM returns as a brutally fun and challenging modern-day shooter experience. Relentless demons, impossibly destructive guns, and fast, fluid movement provide the foundation for intense, first-person combat – whether you’re obliterating demon hordes through the depths of Hell in the single-player campaign, or competing against your friends in numerous multiplayer modes. Expand your gameplay experience using DOOM SnapMap game editor to easily create, play, and share your content with the world. DOOM Eternal (Deluxe Edition) Hell’s armies have invaded Earth. Become the Slayer in an epic single-player campaign to conquer demons across dimensions and stop the final destruction of humanity. The only thing they fear... is you. The Deluxe Edition contains a demonic Slayer skin, classic weapon sound pack and access to both campaign expansions for the critically-acclaimed DOOM Eternal. Your victory over Hell’s armies pulled humanity back from the edge of extinction, but it came at a cost. An imbalance of power in the heavens requires the true ruler of this universe to rise and set things right. Wage war across never-before-seen realms of the DOOM Universe, fight against new demons, and wield new abilities in your never-ending battle against the forces of evil.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202501/1019/8c2e76e354ae86ca46e69243feaa1695ebe62bb00775e8a6.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1003-PPSA01982_00-DOOMANTHOLOGY000","65%","0","Shooter, Action","839.65","null","null","DOOM Anthology","TRD","Bethesda","2025-01-22","doom-anthology-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2399.00","0","839.65","1","",

Collect time bonuses, avoid dangers and decide what path to go to complete all the mazes. There are 50 levels in the game. Each level consists of a set of 10 mazes. So, there are 500 mazes in total. There is level select menu where you can choose any completed level. But you cannot choose the specific maze in the level – they go one by one and if you fail at any of the 10 mazes you choose start the level from the beginning. You have 60 seconds but the time can be increased or decreased using pickups. Also, sometimes you should wait to avoid dangers, use alternative paths or teleport to be able to move forward. The difficulty of the levels is increasing with each level and is determined by the size of the maze, the amount of time bonuses and other items such as moving walls, teleports, closed doors and other. Sometimes time bonuses that give additional time are not bonuses at all because it can take more time to get to them that they bring.

The best-in-class “boomer shooter” is available on PlayStation 5 and it’s never been more fun to bullet-time head-shot corporate mercenaries while you sprint and wall-jump through grungy 90s anime-inspired cities. “I can’t stop playing this Titanfall-F.E.A.R.-Killzone-Doom-Like,” raves Kotaku, adding that Sprawl is a “violently delightful time, and one of [our] favorite games so far this year.” Neither can we, guys. And we invite all PS5 owners to get in on the action. Become Seven, a disgraced special ops super soldier commanded by a mysterious voice, as she struggles to escape the walled city, overthrow the Junta, and discover the secrets of the Spire. Sprawl delivers relentless FPS action combined with acrobatic parkour so juicy and addictive that it would make Mirror’s Edge blush, and it does it all to the tune of an incredible dynamic electronic-industrial soundtrack that changes based on how you play. “Fluid movement, excellent level design, gratifying combat and a bombastic soundtrack make SPRAWL a fantastic and challenging shooter,” gushes Finger Guns. All of this. What’s more, Sprawl runs at a blazing-fast, never-hiccups framerate with controls tailor-made for PlayStation 5, features hours of frenzied precision gameplay, an intriguing storyline, slow-mo cinematic kills, a variety of nostalgic weapons, and yes, a freakin’ high-flying shotgun-jump. Because everybody needs a shotgun-jump that propels them a dozen feet into the air and over fences where they can continue mowing down enemies. This is what next-gen has been missing and you’re very welcome. Features • Twitch FPS with verticality and parkour movement • A robust single-player campaign spanning 6+ hours across 12 completely different regions to explore • Seven unique, nostalgic weapons including the Shogo Ken-Bishi Auto Load (grenade launcher), the Hiro-Enki YT (rail gun), and the Metatech A8 (yes, that aforementioned shotgun and all of its shotgun-jumping glory) • Time trials with seven original maps • Horde mode with five exclusive additional maps • 20+ unique enemy types right out of your cyberpunk dreams • An unforgettable electronic-industrial soundtrack comprised of 13 original songs • 60fps+ and not one single hiccup ever","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202411/1317/a3c113b0ca5691da194cf453bc88d67b805a4a286930c9fe.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/UP6163-PPSA12488_00-5233101333812786","75%","0","Shooter","105","null","null","Sprawl","TRD","Rogue Games, Inc.","2024-11-21","sprawl-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","131.25","0","",

"","2025-03-26","The fifth entry in the SaGa franchise returns as Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven a full 3D remake of the original 1993 RPG. Embark on an exciting adventure fit for both new players and long-time fans, highlighting classic and new SaGa franchise features, full Japanese and English voiceovers, rearranged compositions, and much more! STORY In an age past, warriors known as the Seven Heroes fought to save humankind. Praise slowly turned to curses as their fellow Ancients came to fear their power and banished them to another dimension. Their good deeds lived on as legends passed down through the ages, foretelling that the Heroes would return when the world needed them most... True to the legend, the Heroes have reappeared...but their long exile has corrupted their forms and they now seek vengeance on all who wronged them. Take on the role of the Emperor of Avalon as legions of fiends spread across territories under the Heroes' command. Defend your Empire across successive generations, expand your realm, and defeat the vengeful Seven Heroes one by one to save the world! KEY FEATURES ÃƒÂ¢–Ã‚Â  Characters & Imperial Succession Join forces with characters from over 30 different classes featuring a wide variety of professions and races, each with their own favored weapons, unique abilities, and effective tactics. Choose the next Emperor from this wide pool of candidates, each eligible to inherit the throne and become the next protagonist. The knowledge and abilities of previous rulers are passed down to the next through the mystical art of inheritance magic, forging a lasting bond between you and your chosen characters. ÃƒÂ¢–Ã‚Â Free-Form Scenario The game presents a unique story structure that offers a vast array of narrative experiences in response to your choices and which objectives you tackle first—from how you expand the Empire to what order you challenge the Seven Heroes. Your actions and decisions will dramatically alter the course of the Emperor's journey. ÃƒÂ¢–Ã‚Â Combat The strategic turn-based battle system of the original has been further enhanced to a timeline system. Enjoy all the classic SaGa mechanics like ""Glimmers,"" where you learn new abilities whilst in the heat of battle, and ""Formations,"" which provide unique benefits to the retinue based on composition. Furthermore, the remake welcomes the new ""United Attack"" feature to perform combination attacks with your retinue members to turn the tide of battle! ÃƒÂ¢–Ã‚Â Graphics The original 2D pixel sprites are now modeled in full 3D while retaining their charming, familiar appearances based on the beautiful concept illustrations by Tomomi Kobayashi. All towns and dungeons are now also fully rendered with reworked terrains and layouts. ÃƒÂ¢–Ã‚Â Difficulty Settings Select from one of three difficulty levels to match your preferred playstyle, from Casual, Normal, to Hard (Classic). Casual offers a story-focused experience with less emphasis on battle, while Normal is recommended for veteran RPG players looking for a balanced game. Hard (Classic) is perfect for players looking for the brutal but satisfying challenge of the original 1993 version. ÃƒÂ¢–Ã‚Â Music & Voices Kenji Ito returns to present a beautiful soundtrack full of new arrangements! The music can be toggled between the original and new versions from the Options screen. Furthermore, all event scenes now feature full Japanese and English voice acting.","2025-03-11","/game/152391","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2910/e8146bd54da924d5efd03b8bf5b441646b09a74a7f021f2f.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0082-PPSA16565_00-ROMANCINGSAGA2RE","30%","0","Role-Playing","1469.3","null","null","Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven -","TRD","Square Enix LTD","2024-10-23","romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven--ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","1469.30","1","",

Into the Fray is part of the Skautfold Series and follows Usurper and Shrouded in Sanity but can be played on its own. Story The story is set in 1899 on the island of Portland.

"","2025-03-26","EA SPORTSÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢ NHLÃƒ‚Ã‚Â® 25 is powered by ICE-Q, a new gameplay intelligence system that gives you the time and space to control every inch of the ice. Next-Gen Vision Control allows you to walk the blue line, square up to the puck carrier, stay locked on goal, and much more. Empowered AI completely overhauls Chel’s CPU player system, upping their authenticity with a refreshed playbook that improves powerplays and opens up the ice for better overall positioning and offensive opportunities. Reactive Actions utilizes a series of new animations to make skaters more responsive in critical situations, increasing their urgency, collision avoidance, and reliability. ICE-Q is true hockey intelligence. Plus, the addition of a revamped Franchise Mode experience, a brand-new WOC Live Events structure, HUT Wildcard Mode, and a simplified, single-path XP progression shared across HUT kicks Chel’s game modes up a notch. The all-new Grudge Match System keeps track of the competitive history between teams across all major online and offline modes and enhances games with special X-Factors that are earned in previous matchups against rival teams. Finally, the introduction of Sapien Technology takes character likenesses to a whole other level. Like the Hughes Brothers, NHL 25 is next-gen hockey. This game includes optional in-game purchases of virtual currency that can be used to acquire virtual in-game items, including a random selection of virtual in-game items.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202502/1121/0f466021fe2735e27a44855e8e0db8bafa20d2bc7d53ad50.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/UP0006-PPSA18744_00-NHLPS5HOCKEY2025","70%","0","Sports","999999","null","null","NHLÃƒ‚Ã‚Â® 25","TRD","EA Swiss Sarl","2024-09-27","nhl-25-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2900.00","0","870.00","0","",

"","2025-03-26","Astrea is a DICE-deck-building roguelike that flips the script on deckbuilders by using dice instead of cards and an unique dual “damage” system: Purification vs Corruption. Build a dice pool strong enough to purify Astrea's out-of-control corruption and save the Star System. Long ago - when ancient ruins were once flourishing civilizations and their populace lived in idyllic bliss - a mystical star governed all. Loyal disciples, called Six-Sided Oracles, were blessed by their star, granting them the strength to seal away the gift of heavenly bodies within mystic relics. All was perfect and harmonious, until that one fateful day - The Crimson Dawn Cataclysm. A ferocious inferno sundered down from the sky, engulfing the entirety of the star system, crumbling the foundations of their society and corrupting the souls of the weak-willed. The disciples of the star were lost to the chaos - their creations scattered across a vast world of ruin. Could there still exist those who were capable of wielding their power? Eons later, descendants of the Six-Sided Oracles embark on a journey to finish the failed battle that their predecessors started and save their star system. Feature List: • Unique dual “damage” system: Purification vs Corruption - In Astrea there is a new type of “damage” system. Purification can be used to damage enemies or heal yourself. On the other hand, corruption can be used to damage yourself or heal the enemies. Pacify enemies through Purification, or Corrupt yourself to unleash abilities that help tip the scales. • Dynamic Health Bar system - With skills attached to your health bar, you can take Corruption to enable these skills and unleash powerful abilities. But be careful, if you take too much Corruption you will be consumed by it. • Not cards, but dice! - Build a dice pool that fits your playstyle. Choose from over 350 dice and three dice types; reliably safe, perfectly balanced, or powerfully risky. A dice type system designed with high-risk, high-reward in its core. • Customize your dice - Forge your fate by editing die faces with new actions, tipping the odds of powerful results into your favor. • Choose from Six Brave Oracles - Each possessing their own unique dice sets, abilities, and playstyles. From ingenious spellcasters to brutish berserkers, whether you like beating the opponent into submission or outsmarting them with clever plays, there’s an oracle for you. • 20 Upgradeable Support Sentinels - Enchanted constructs that offer supportive dice rolls making them reliable companions in the heat of battle. • Uncover Over 170 Modifying Blessings -Imbue your Oracle with unique passives yielding potent effects that change up your fundamental tactics. Choose between Star Blessings, passive effects with lower power, or Black Hole Blessings, powerful passive effects with a drawback. • More than 20 random events - Find mysterious locations that can change the course of your run. • Manipulate your enemies and control your fate - Enemies attack using their own die, making it possible for you to manipulate their die to change their intent. • 16 Difficulty Levels - Customize your experience using difficulty levels to test all your abilities.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202408/3023/464afdad6b06aefe835403f7bab004a7bbf30ff1ec209e5d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/HP3332-CUSA49515_00-0181265333093009","20%","0","Action, Strategy, Role Playing Games","656.25","null","null","Astrea: Six-Sided Oracles","TRD","AKUPARA GAMES","2024-09-26","astrea-six-sided-oracles-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","875.00","0","700.00","1","",

"","2025-03-26","Nubla Nubla proposes an adventure that begins in the halls of the Thyssen museum. Following him, we begin a journey that will take us to discover the wonderful world of Nubla, full of puzzles and forgotten places. Who has not dreamed of plunging into one of the paintings hanging on the wall of a museum and venture into an unknown world? Throughout this first chapter of Nubla the underlying theme of our game is the construction of identity, something that we will discover from conceptualizing inspired by the art, many challenges in the form of puzzles that we face, discovering the forgotten world of Nubla. Nubla, is not only a game but an interesting educational project that puts in dialogue the art, technology and new narratives. It generates, in certain ways, a reinterpretation and creatively vision of the works of the museum. Backgrounds, characters and game mechanics are inspired by works and artistic styles, bringing the world of art in a playful and fun way. Nubla 2 Nubla 2, continues the adventure of the characters we met in Nubla Episode 1 from the end of their boat trip. Once in the continent, they must begin their search for the City in the Center of the World, looking to return the memory to that world, now lost. But getting there will not be easy. The City is not a physical place: It is beyond the dreams and the trip will definitely be hard and dangerous for our characters, who now have not only Nubla to achieve their goal but with many other characters and inhabitants of that world will be finding in their way. Nubla 2, as its predecessor, not only combines the narrative of the videogame and the concepts behind art and pictures in the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum, but rather to tell us much more: If the recurring theme in Nubla was the search for identity and memory, now the subject of borders, time and space, which makes us all refugees in a world that is no longer ours will be the main theme of Nubla 2.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202201/0818/XsAT4jQGz9x5GfvgsHYhThBK.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0811-CUSA03320_00-0748156540740807","60%","0","Adventure, Adventure, Action","279.6","null","null","Nubla 10 Anniversary Edition","TRD","GAMMERA NEST SL","2024-09-11","nubla-10-anniversary-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","279.60","1","",

Deadlink is a guns-blazing cyberpunk FPS with roguelite elements. You're the first operative to be recruited to the experimental Deadlink project. Pilot an autonomous combat shell, fighting your way through cramped slums, twisted labs, grimy warehouses, and sleek office buildings on a mission to thwart the schemes of the most powerful corporations in the world. Wield a deadly arsenal, upgrade your skills and tech, devastate destructible environments, and slash corporate profit margins — all at the same time. You are the Corporate Security Agency’s greatest weapon, and it's your job to make sure the corporations and their shady deals are anything but secure. With the team at HQ backing you up, you're tossed headfirst into the fray, where a military operation with plausible deniability can fix things for a fraction of the cost of a hopeless court case. Every randomized run will be different, but one thing never changes: you will be outnumbered. Get ready to think on your feet as you dash, jump, and use the environment to your advantage. You can't still, not even for a second. Equip your shell with powerful weapon loadouts. Try out various combinations as you blaze a path of destruction. Want to snipe your foes from a distance, debilitate them with status effects, or just go in guns blazing? Whatever your playstyle, you can find the right kit for the job. Your enemies have no shortage of bullets and bodies to throw at you. But you're no slouch either. Sure, you might lose a combat shell here and there, but your next one will be even tougher.

"","2025-03-26","You are a representative of the CRAFT & Co company. You are selling automated fabrication tools across the galaxy when your spacecraft crashes into a hostile planet where you'll have to build the strongest defenses if you wish to live to escape from it. But be warned... this planet is merciless. Use the tools you sell and the local resources to build up all of what you'll need to survive and eventually be able to escape the planet. Explore, fight, craft and build your defenses! Enjoy a unique and innovative game: - Strategy: survive massive attacks each night by building strong walls and placing turrets wisely. - Physics: build wisely or your structures will collapse! And you will need them to defend your base, or build bridges and high towers to access remote locations. - Water cycle: rain, infiltration, underground rivers and lakes... be careful during the heavy rains, or you could be surprised by a sudden water level rise! - Play classic or try the custom game modes: Under the Sea (start in a cave under a huge ocean!), Sky World (a random world composed of hundreds of flying islands), or Base Defense (no exploration, only base building and defense). - Activate the Hazardous Events option to trigger various surprises like Meteor Shower, Rain Flood, Earthquake, Volcano Eruption or even a Sharkstorm! - Enjoy Creative Mode and produce all items for free. This includes cheated items and tools to modify terrain or even create water and lava! Gameplay: - Fun from the start: no awfully slow digging, so you can concentrate on the exploration, fights and strategy. - Game's final objective: you must build a rocket ship to escape the planet. - Strategy survival: the game is a survival game in a strategic meaning. No hunger needs, the whole point of the game is to survive to the massive attacks each night. And to do that, you will have to explore the world to gather resources and craft your defenses. Fights: - No swords, magic or flying clown monsters here! It's a consistent science-fiction world, with fast and fun laser guns fights! - Intelligent monsters: they will find the best path to attack your defenses. And be careful: even if they can't move through walls, they can still destroy them! - Difficulty progression: only the species of monsters you have already killed before attack during the night (they probably took it badly). So you can progress at your own pace and choose when you are ready to move forward and fight stronger monsters. - AI companion: your crashed ship contains an AI that survived and will give you useful advices (or not!). Build him a drone so he can follow you and even help you fight the monsters! World Simulation: - Huge world with global real-time simulation of the environment, physics, water cycle and lighting. - Electricity: build solar panels or functional hydroelectric generators to power your base’s most advanced items! - Plants simulation: plants naturally grow and spread if their life-conditions are met. Create some farms with artificial sun lamps and irrigation. - Procedurally generated world: Major areas locations are specific to benefit from a logical game progression, but detailed layout of surface, caverns, ores, etc. are unique at each playthrough. Crafting and Building: - Crafting: You dig minerals, harvest plants and kill some monsters and bosses in order to craft better items and defenses. But the digging is really fast, your inventory space is infinite and all crafting recipes are displayed, so you don’t waste all your time on grinding or wikis and can concentrate on setting up better defenses. - Base construction: You build a fortress, not a holiday house.","2025-03-11","/game/27785","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2308/6e56d24f2550a77bee5a652a33655c45836d672e31c9d890.png?w=200","13","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0958-PPSA06478_00-DIGORDIEPS5EU000","75%","35","Adventure","87.25","null","null","Dig or Die","TRD","BLITWORKS SL","2024-06-05","dig-or-die-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","349.00","0","87.25","1","",

Customize your pool ball – choose your favorite color and design - and go head-to-head with your friends. Have a splashing good time! These pool balls are not just adorable, but also surprisingly athletic. They reach ridiculous speeds as they roll and bounce around the arena in no-time! Plus, these balls can kick each other around because they're balls after all! You'll be amazed by the sheer power of a perfectly aimed kick, propelling a rival ball all over the stage. Grab a cue and join the party! Features: • Chaotic physics-based sports & brawl games • Play with up to 4 players in local multiplayer or solo • Add bots to fill out teams or practice your skills • Easy to learn, hard to master. Anyone can join the fun! • Various game modes like Pool, Idol, Sumo and Free-for-all Game modes: • Pool: Score by kicking balls of your color into the open holes, but be careful not to fall in yourself! • Tennis: Either solo or in doubles, kick the ball across the court to score! • Sumo: No kicking allowed! Push the other players into the water by rolling into them. It’s push or be pushed! • Football: With one or two players on each team, shoot your ball in the opposing goal to score – or kick your opponents way to clear your path to the goal. • Idol: Compete to pick up and hold on to a small idol. Gain points by holding the idol – but beware: holding the idol means you can’t roll, while your opponents chase you down to knock the idol out of your hands. • Jinxed: One of the players is cursed! Kick, push or hit the other players to pass the curse onto them. When the timer runs out, the cursed player loses and the curse finds a new target. The last one standing wins! • Free-for-all: Knock your opponents into the holes and try to be the last one standing. • Tournament: Play a mix of all of different game modes and become the ultimate Pool Party champion!","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/2222/6951a9af799574a59913a4614345ad0a810e1f88818f27f6.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3945-PPSA19380_00-0072579820631109","50%","0","Family, Party, Sport","174.5","null","null","Pool Party","TRD","MINDSCAPE BV","2024-05-16","pool-party-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","349.00","0","174.50","1","",

Drop into the land where you will find a cool array of weapons to knock out your opponents with. From small snowball guns to epic ice blasters or electric zappers, rocket launchers, slime bomb guns, and paintball guns there are so many fun ways to play be sure to grab a cake or two and splatter your opponents right in the face. Pick up and eat beans to land smelly pumps. For quick getaways get your hands on a jetpack to fly away if you're finding yourself in trouble. The battle is played out on the Fitzgerald land and there can be only one king or queen of the land. There are handy level shops around the land to buy your favourite weapons by simply collecting as many coins and diamonds from the wide range of chests scattered around the land and if you are lucky enough to pick up some x-ray glasses you can seek out your opponents much easier. The safe zone will shrink in fast making matches quick and fun. Oh by the way watch out for Bruce the zombie and the ghost of posh aunt's mansion they think they own the Fitzgerald's land too. So come on and join in on the fun.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/0710/c03f8d287507292078f4da8cf644f135dc30e95d8f74af21.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/UP6259-CUSA45888_00-0199601264012877","50%","0","Shooter","49","null","null","Fun with the Fitzgeralds","TRD","Joanne Hamer","2024-05-10","fun-with-the-fitzgeralds-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","245.00","0","122.50","1","",

The broken promise of a better tomorrow, the fear of repeating humankind’s mistakes, faith in reason, or renouncing humanity altogether - the choices you make and the sides you take will determine the course of events.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202407/1921/589e3f1ff028f95205f7b902d53ffb65539672a4c8d6ccdb.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3643-PPSA05888_00-0381219306141488","50%","0","Puzzle","699.6","null","null","The Talos Principle Collection","TRD","Devolver Digital","2024-05-01","the-talos-principle-collection-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","0","874.50","1","",

"","2025-03-26","The latest standalone entry in the SaGa franchise, SaGa Emerald Beyond, brings together the very best elements of the beloved series to offer each player their own unique gameplay experience. Make use of glimmers and combos in battle; meet a diverse cast of races, including monsters, mechs, and vampires; and experience your very own story, created through your choices and actions. Distant Worlds Woven Together: Travel to 17 unique worlds from the Junction, either led by the hand of destiny or by a path forged by your own choices. Discover the completely different cultures and landscapes, ranging from a densely developed forest of skyscrapers and a green and luscious habitat covered in plant life to a world governed by five witches, or one ruled by vampires - just to name a few of the distinct settings. An Eclectic Cast of Protagonists: Six leading characters, all from diverse backgrounds and with vastly different goals, set out on their journey in five unique story arcs. They venture to the myriad of worlds for their very own personal reasons: One, a human on a mission to protect the barrier defending his city; another, a witch trying to regain her lost magic while maintaining her disguise as a schoolgirl; and yet another, a vampire lord out to regain his crown and reclaim the throne as the rightful king of his world. Even selecting the same protagonist for a second--or third or fourth--playthrough will lead to completely new events and stories, a completely fresh path and experience. A Story of Your Very Own Making: SaGa Emerald Beyond has the greatest number of branching plots of any game in the SaGa series. The story branches abundantly depending on your choices and actions. Every time you visit a world, the story will evolve, allowing the protagonist and player alike to discover new possibilities. As the story unfolds in this way it becomes a tale all of your own, not only affecting the path you walk but also the multiple potential endings that await each protagonist. Battles where a Single Choice Can Change Everything: SaGa Emerald Beyond further refines the highly strategic Timeline Battles the SaGa franchise has been long renowned for. With series mainstays such as the skill to spontaneously acquire abilities through the Glimmer system, tactical ally placement known as Formations, and United Attacks that enable individual skills to connect together to form devastating chain attacks, it offers the best iteration of SaGa's turn-based combat to date. The new combat system adds more drama than ever before, allowing you to support party members, interrupt enemy actions, and use United Attacks by strategically manipulating the order of ally actions. The characters that join you, the weapons you wield, your party formation, and your tactics in battle - everything is up to you!","2025-03-11","/game/137793","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/1110/3e091ae115b4cad403eb9f591e3c59cc1488ac656c9a4e0d.png?w=200","13","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0082-PPSA16123_00-SAGAEMERALDBYDEU","40%","57","Role-Playing","1049.4","null","null","SaGa Emerald Beyond -","TRD","Square Enix LTD","2024-04-24","saga-emerald-beyond--ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","29","1049.40","1","",

"","2025-03-26","Kingdoms and Castles is a city-building simulation game about growing a kingdom from a tiny hamlet to a sprawling city and imposing castle. Your kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner. Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen. And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter. A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests. Forge your kingdom's destiny in Kingdoms and Castles, a captivating city-building adventure where your choices define your realm's prosperity and survival.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/0611/8428ac1bdf23df8111a843081c571ee57ecaf0ab3281f7b2.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0958-PPSA16909_00-KINGDOMSANDPS5EU","34%","0","Strategy, Simulator","346.5","null","null","Kingdoms and Castles","TRD","BLITWORKS SL","2024-03-21","kingdoms-and-castles-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","346.50","1","",

Unlock new parts, destroy more, witness entropy at its worst in digital-brutalist cityscapes. Build to destroy. GAMEPLAY BUILD Choose from parts with different weights, forms and functions to build a structure. Thruster + Connector + Bomb? You just built a rocket. Thruster + Rotator + Laser? You just built a rotating laser rocket. Pillar + Connector + Ultra Heavy Cube? That's a giant hammer. Be creative and resourceful with the parts you get, try to destroy the target with less parts or in a more elegant way – it's going to be a spectacle any way you do it. DESTROY Try to hit the main targets to win a level in campaign mode. Destroy an armored wall first so you can then shoot through the hole into the vulnerable center. Try to hit a bomb in the environment. Use environment mechanics like the giant Pistons to catapult Ultra Heavy Cubes into a target. Or just throw everything you have at your targets – that might just work too."" FEATURES COMPLEX DESTRUCTION SYSTEM Simulated statics, thousands of little particles of debris, whole chunks of targets flying into the abyss – with little to no framerate spikes. CAMPAIGN Seven worlds with several stages including bonus levels each, every stage a hand-crafted destructible cityscape. You will start each stage with a limited set of parts and you will need to find a strategy on how to use them to destroy all main target blocks. You will unlock new parts the further you progress, and every world comes with it's own special environmental mechanic. You can always return to a stage to try to destroy a higher percentage of it, or do it in less moves. SANDBOX Try out new patterns of building stuff. Play around with parts you haven't unlocked yet. Try to fry your GPU with 1000 Lasers at once. NEW: ENDLESS MODE Play the new Endless game mode and try to reach the ultimate highscore.

Do you want your very own zombie companion? A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen! Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable. It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive… A destination with plenty of surprises Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive. Home sweet home Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. The more the merrier… You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable. Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.

A key feature of Listeria Wars is the parallel viewing experience. In addition to the main game process, you can view the life of the human whose body has become the pathogenic battlefield. The action in Listeria Wars takes place within the hero's body. You can see everything that happens to the host’s body in real-time. You manage various types of immune system cells, to protect the body and fend off attacks, from deadly contagions. The body’s immune system develops antibodies, as the action takes place. The game illustrates a person’s ability to be his own worst enemy: by neglecting personal hygiene, or ingesting rotten food, or failing to follow “social distancing”. You can also view the body’s use of involuntary immune system responses, such as vomiting and diarrhea. The goal is to protect and defend the infected body, from the deadly pathogens. Key features: FUNNY ADVENTURES OF THE HERO: Watch the effects of malicious pathogens and influence the immune system’s response. CONVENIENT MANAGEMENT: Leukocytes attack intuitively, depending on the situation. Gamers can place these cells strategically and monitor the overall course of defense. PATHOGEN DIVERSITY: Realistic infections, microbes, viruses, bacteria, and other harmful pathogens. TACTICS: Manage unique leukocytes using their tactical advantages against the various pathogens, infecting the host.

Upon realizing the true potential of the artifact, he embarks on a journey filled with challenges and hardships to unlock its full might. The island holds numerous perilous dungeons, some inhabited by ancient and terrifying bosses, while others house more misunderstood and talkative ones. To enhance his chances of conquering the island's challenges, our hero will acquire new skills, catch fish, cook nutritious meals, discover valuable treasures, and seek blessings from the many deities at the island's shrines. Many charming inhabitants reside on the island. Among them are merchants who are open to trade with our hero, while others will send him on adventurous quests, offering him handsome rewards in return.

Excavate the bedrock, reap the rewards of Mother Earth, and trade the mined valuables for new gadgets, travels, funky wild fashion, and more. Cave Digger 2 is a 1-4-player action-adventure game set in wildland valleys, where you discover old mines, nautical caves, and ruins of ancient civilizations inspired by Western, Dieselpunk and Lovecraftian themes. Explore the ""pristine"" lands, loot its riches, and unravel the mystery linked to a great explorer. As you go, it's best to keep a six-shooter nearby just in case. Tools and Progression Get thrown right away into the deep end by being stuck in the mines as your drill machine broke. With a single pickaxe, work your way to the surface camp where your journey can begin in earnest. Your goal is simply to mine and carry loot back to the surface the best you can for your mission assigners. With the surplus reward that you get, you can buy new things like upgrading your dependable pickaxe with a shinier look! (And faster digging rate.) Or buy dynamites that work on pretty much anything that needs to be worked on. Maybe you fancy a shovel that works for both digging and moving through the caves like a spider-miner. Whatever your preferred loadout, you will be ready to go deeper into the ever-shifting caves than any miner before or after you! Story The valleys have their mysteries and they hide them well. Step by step the player follows the same path where a great explorer has once wandered. Who is this hardy explorer? Why did he come to these valleys? And where is he now? The answers to these and more lie in the depths of the valleys. The story has multiple endings, each revealing a different side of it. Find the scattered comic pages to a tale of greed, eldritch power, and secrets beyond space and time. Who the wanderer is and why he did what he did in the valleys become clear in the end, but is it really the end? Co-op Multiplayer Gather a party of up to 4 players. Your role in the mining team is totally up to you! As long as at least somebody is carrying their weight in gold back to the surface, you all get paid in official Merchant Dollars equally. Co-op crossplay supports public matchmaking and private groups, and you are very free to show your wildlands drip by combining things from a generous selection of clothes, hats and faces once you've bought them first. So, take a pickaxe (and your friends) with you and head to the wildlands for the riches it holds, find out the secrets it contains, and dig deeper into the valleys than any adventurer before or after you!

Step by step, explore the Supernatural Threat Reduction Agency and discover its mysteries and secrets as you gradually make your way to the top floor, where one of the most important and mysterious finds of our time is being studied: the tomb of the ancient Goddess of War, Anath. The main character is a special agent who came after receiving the red danger level signal.

The gameplay combines elements of scrolling shooter, action roguelike, and bullet hell games with a fast-paced combat system sufficient to test your skills in the fight against evil. The Agency is an ever-changing building that combines well-designed rooms and randomly generated mazes. Its task is to obstruct the spread of otherworldly forces and protect against any possible threats in the event of danger.

ENDLESSÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESSÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her ""unusual"" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESSÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0605/NqS2wkRWsphmkL2kpu5seE0W.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0177-PPSA02665_00-ENDLESSDELUXEEU0","50%","0","Strategy, Action","439.5","null","null","ENDLESSÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢ Dungeon Last Wish Edition","TRD","SEGA EUROPE LTD","2023-10-17","endless-dungeon-last-wish-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","879.00","0","439.50","1","",

Battles occur on quarter-view maps with height differences, where character positioning in the front, back, and side of enemy units may very well determine each battle’s outcome. Support effects depend on where allied characters in your party are positioned, allowing players to enjoy highly strategic maneuvers. Players have a high degree of freedom in character development, such as acquiring and strengthening skills and changing classes by using skill points earned in battle. The characters are beautifully drawn with rich facial expressions by the illustrator Sakura Mochi! [Story] Several years have passed since a mysterious disease with no cure quickly spread across the continent. Those infected would suffer a horrible fate of turning into zombies after their death, mindlessly attacking the living. It has become the norm for hired mercenaries to spend countless days clearing the lands of the undead. Such a mercenary is Johann, captain of the Silver Wolf Mercenary Company. He is paid a visit by the Grim Reaper, and narrowly escapes its blade of death, but the Reaper leaves him with an eerie prophecy: ""In the next 100 days, your luck shall run out. That shall be the day of your fate.” After awaking from a delirious slumber, he is met by a young woman with miraculous powers that can heal people from the disease. Was his encounter with the Grim Reaper but a nightmare....? Regardless, Johann offers to protect the miracle worker on her travels to save as many people as she can.

"","2025-03-26","""Golden Key, or The Adventures of Buratino"" is the famous fairy tale story by Soviet writer Alexei Tolstoy, author of such iconic works as ""The Road to Calvary"", ""Aelita (novel)"", and ""Ibicus"". The story of Pinocchio began with the translation of Carlo Collodi's Italian fairy tale Pinocchio, but then developed into a completely different, author Alexei Tolstoy's story. He brought more adventurism and fun to the story and added many new details and changes. The story was adapted for film, theatrical productions, and the tale itself was published in the USSR 182 times, was translated into 47 languages, and reached a total circulation of 14.5 million copies.

What if you could buy them both at once, together in some sort of combined bundle? Does that calm you down a bit? Are you okay now? You were freaking us out a bit. But now that we’ve explained this bundle situation you’re looking a lot better. Mind if we continue? If you don’t know what you’re getting into, here’s the deal: High On Life is an action-packed comedy-adventure FPS filled with unhinged talking guns, an evil alien drug cartel selling humans on the black market, and an impressive variety of gorgeous and seedy spacefaring locales to explore. You wanna buy goop from a back-alley salesman? You wanna tell some construction workers that their dad will never love them? You wanna rescue a talking knife from a bunch of a gang of ant clones? You can do ALL of those things in High On Life, trust me. And a lot more. I didn’t even mention a lot of the other stuff you can do. And then there’s High on Knife, the meaty DLC centered around that talking knife I mentioned earlier. Knifey. His name’s Knifey, and this is his big adventure. He’s gonna find out all about the dark(?) mysterious(?) secrets(?) of his past as you take him and Harper, a brand new talking gun, to a salt-planet filled with dying slugs. And then from there maybe you’ll meet a giant guy, race some slow-as-hell slugs, or go for the high score in Peroxosquash with B.A.L.L., another new talking gun. We really packed this DLC full of new stuff, trust me. And we didn’t even get to the spooky parasite-filled shipping warehouse run by a ruthless, monstrous CEO. I should also mention that this bundle features an all-star cast of comedic voice talent guaranteed to put the “funny” back in “wouldn’t it be soooo funny if you bought this bundle right now?” We’ve got JB Smoove, Tim Robinson, Betsy Sodaro, Sarah Sherman, Michael Cusack, Gabourey Sidibe, and so many more who are now mad at me because I didn’t put their names in here but, look, I’ve got a word limit I’m working with.

Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself. Every location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world.

Now you can embrace the legendary cruelty and humor of the iconic cartoon as you play your favorite characters in The Crackpet Show: Happy Tree Friends Edition! Get ready to unleash chaos, earn fame, and have a blast! Are you ready to get famous? If so, grab your gun and join the most violent TV show in the history of violent TV shows! Participants will have to shoot, smash and rip through hundreds of enemies on their way to victory!

But who cares about death when your audience loves YOU? Unlike real life, here you can make good use of the likes you receive. Use your new-found fame to help upgrade every item and every perk to deal even more damage when you head out again. Oh, don’t worry about getting bored: every episode of the show is randomized so you’ll never have the same run twice in-a-row. And, when you are completely done with show business, invite your friends and party-up with co-op mode with up to four players! Play smart and synergize with the team or bash their teeth in when they will try to steal your power-ups: every dirty trick in the book is valid, and every strategy works as long as you are having fun.

The graphic style is a colourful low-poly 3D, bringing a unique and nostalgic look to the game and calling you to spend your time in the exploration of its diverse regions and immerse in the about 15-hour-long storytelling, rich in cutscenes and dialogues. Since its earliest prototype in 2007-2008, DREAMERS has been all about traveling, about the patience and curiosity required for new discoveries, and about encounters that await you along the way. Join the three protagonists - the Boy, the Girl, and the Robot - and be ready to walk a lot and talk a lot with the numerous NPCs inhabiting the colorful world. Some of them may involve you in the fetch quests, while others will touch your heart or amuse you with their tales. DREAMERS is a game that celebrates friendship and the connections we form throughout our life journey, the choices that we face, and the consequences that arise from them. DREAMERS is a peaceful, non-violent adventure for players of all ages.

In addition to fetch quests and stories, DREAMERS offers a variety of puzzles, challenges, and minigames that are enjoyable even for those who may feel less experienced with a controller. Activities range from fishing and taking photos, to a memory card game, resort tycoon, and an entire infrastructure of drone races and upgrades. These diverse and, accessible side quests enrich the main storyline and provide a delightful break from your explorative adventures.

She wanders over to a bookshed deep inside, returning with a big, thick book. ""I found this interesting-looking book!"" Kotora looks back at her quizzically. Suddenly, a slip of paper falls out from the book. The letter reads: ""Find Alice."" As soon as they read the words, the two are enveloped in a blinding light. When they come to, they're in a grassy field that they've never seen before. At that moment, a white rabbit comes hopping along. He might know how to get back to their own world! The pair take their first steps into the world of this magical book, in order to go searching for the white rabbit... Alice Escaped! is an exploratory 2D action Metroidvania. Follow the adventures of Usada and Kotora, who have wandered into a strange wonderland of grimoires and must chase after a mysterious girl named Alice in order to return to their own world. What awaits them in this mysterious world are strange yet familiar characters, such as Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, and Humpty Dumpty. Are they friends or foes? And why does the white rabbit Usamura have a zipper on his back? And who exactly is this enigmatic girl hiding Alice in the deepest part of the world? This is where you've probably realized that this game has multiple endings. There are numerous major choices to be made, a story that repeats itself, and the true goals of the characters to be revealed. An adventure the likes of which you've never experienced before is about to begin! ÃƒÂ¢–Ã‚Â  Battle Action One of the core points of this game is its stylish, tag-team battle system! Swing Usada’s giant hammer to pulverize your enemies with powerful melee attacks, or use Kotora’s submachine gun and bombs to take out enemies from a distance. Switch between the two to chain impressive combos! Chaining combos will increase their attack power, and make it easier to quickly defeat your many oncoming enemies. Taking out enemies builds up your Chance Gauge, which can be used to perform supporting attacks and devastating ultimate attacks. (Feature not included in the demo.) The intensity builds in boss fights: whittle down their Shield Gauge to break their shields, letting you unleash a flurry of attacks. But beware: they've got a variety of powerful attacks to hit you back with! ÃƒÂ¢–Ã‚Â  Our heroines learn and grow When you collect the skill crystals that drop all over the world, you can improve your characters' skills. You can improve their weapons, which will then unlock unique skills. Or you can focus on their stats and movement, and even pick up skills to help them convince others to help them. If you find yourself stuck on a difficult boss, then try taking some time away from the main path to help our heroes grow stronger. Scattered about here and there in the world are death matches (areas where you can't proceed without defeating all of the enemies there), and if you can finish them with a high-count combo, or without taking any damage, you can earn skill crystal fragments. In addition, out in the world you can also find Heart Crystals, which increase your heroes' maximum health, in addition to other key items that they'll need on their adventure. Based on what you find, you might find that they're protected by powerful traps, just like the treasure you'd find deep inside of a cave. Go explore any way you wish in the world of Alice in Wonderland!","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/1820/f41253f41480d5c0a2e1dafd651b1915afe01ac0126acd96.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0734-CUSA43414_00-0922380785609695","30%","0","Action","419.4","null","null","Alice Escaped!","TRD","SEKAI PROJECT, INC","2023-08-24","alice-escaped!-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","489.30","1","",

She's a bit too young for my liking, I prefer people that are over 70 years old. Just a preference, but I'm willing to give her a try. Can you please help me not ruin this date with her? Please?

Of course the main ingredient would be some awesome top-down twin-stick shooting with a moderate amount of the clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© “damsel in distress” story, add a pinch of puzzle-solving, sprinkle some classic hack-and-slash actions, and stir with all the deadly zombies and god-knows-what creatures, resulting in a satisfyingly intense and exciting gameplay experience! The Background – In a Crooked Little Town… Welp! Ricky's graduation trip took an unexpected turn when he arrived in this town, only to discover that its inhabitants had been turned into zombies!?? In order to rescue Ashley, a young girl he had also just met in this unfamiliar town, Ricky strolled into (or is thrown into?) an unexpected adventure, with the help of a mysterious talking skull named MC Skully. Waiting for him will be hordes of zombies, intricately designed challenges, and ridiculously tough bosses with some of the most absurd abilities. The Combat – LOCK N’ LOAD! Who knows! This town seems like a mega-arsenal! Whether you are a cool-headed sniper, close-quarters combat specialist, or grandmaster explosive engineer, you’ll find plenty of fun in Zombie Soup. We have not only gathered “conventional firearms” such as rifles, sniper rifles, SMGs, shotguns, etc., but also a ton of melee weapons like machetes, axes, daggers… And, of course, there are explosives, too. In addition, we have also designed a wide variety of offbeat, special “weapons” – nail gun, pitching machine, fireworks launcher, and even railgun! So you can be armed to the teeth to brave the horde of zombies. Weapon Unlock – TOUGH challenges What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger! Ricky will encounter many carefully designed timed challenges throughout the adventure in addition to boss fights. Those challenges are TOUGH! However, upon completion, you will be able to unlock more powerful weapons. Remember, the harder the challenge, the stronger the reward!","2025-03-11","/game/131659","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2114/d7ef2dfaa33ae38e2755c5987e46bc4e87365edea5698129.png?w=200","1","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7786-PPSA15904_00-ZOMBIESOUPEU0000","75%","0","Action","133","null","null","Zombie Soup","TRD","Astrolabe Games","2023-08-09","zombie-soup-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","665.00","0","166.25","1","",

Whether players are engaging the other team directly, or fighting alongside them against a common enemy, the aim is to accomplish objectives as quickly as possible. Missions vary depending on player skill and other factors, meaning no two matches will unfold the same way.

"","2025-03-26","Split is a first-person puzzle game with the unique mechanics of creating copies of yourself and manipulating time. The gameplay combines many different types of puzzles from more and less famous puzzle games and takes them to a whole new perspective. After the recent war, engineers from Epsilon Energy created the Split indestructible shield system. It was to protect individual giant cities covering almost the entire planet from armed conflicts. Different cities have different policies for their citizens. In West Ulrage, every citizen gets a guardian robot at birth. In Hal'Tor, pairs of robots raise several children each. Whereas in Dievez, people are raised in large centers. Most jobs have been taken over by machines. People work mainly as mechanics, programmers, or operators. The Split control panel is riddled with numerous traps that will require both good reflexes and composure. You can try to destroy enemies or escape from them by using time manipulation and your own clones to distract them. The game's design refers to Brutalism, an architectural style popular around the 1970s. It was promoted, among others, by the game ""Control"". We mixed this style with the digital environment from ""Tron: Legacy"". The levels are full of nooks and crannies, which may seem empty at first glance, but lead to interesting places. We were inspired by games such as: Q.U.B.E.2”, “The Talos Principle”, “The Turing Test”, “Portal”, “The Witness” and “Antichamber”","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0613/98eb73faf8779ccb18896083254a3c26bf0721a46b13204c.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8571-CUSA43172_00-0086476054437186","50%","0","Action, Puzzle","139.6","null","null","Split","TRD","FreeMind S.A.","2023-07-07","split-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","174.50","1","",

Get a babysitter for the kids, this game is a madcap, mile-a-minute spree of spies, dives, and gun-toting bad guys that will have you on the edge of your seat. You take on the role of Jack, a handsome, jaded former intelligence officer pulled out of his retired life as a strip club regular for one last mission to stop the villainous virologist Krueger, who plans to unleash a mind-controlling virus on the unsuspecting citizens of L.A. Everyone is out to kill Jack now that he’s hot on Krueger’s trail, and he’ll need to use his mind, muscles, and mojo to stay alive long enough to stop Kruger’s plot. Your spur-of-the-moment decisions will help or hinder Jack as he tries to find and protect the only scientist who has the cure to counter Krueger’s deadly bioweapon. A restoration and remaster of a game lost to time for over 25 years, American Hero was originally designed for the Atari Jaguar CD as a “playable movie” with a groundbreaking, more fluid presentation than the FMV games of its time. The game features the talents of professional actors, including Timothy Bottoms (The Last Picture Show, Johnny Got His Gun), Daniel Roebuck (The Fugitive, Final Destination), and Musetta Vander (O Brother, Where Art Thou, Wild Wild West). For this restoration, Timothy Bottoms reprises his role in newly recorded voiceovers of Jack’s inner thoughts heard throughout the game. This restoration was rebuilt from the ground up with new game logic that delivers on the ambitious promise of the original game. This edition of the game includes new voicework from star Timothy Bottoms to accompany the original footage, completing the American Hero experience for the first time.

After meticulously analyzing Meat Boy all throughout Super Meat Boy Forever (did you notice the cameras in the levels???), the nefarious Dr. Fetus now has all the data he needs to create the perfect Meat Boy clone! There’s just one problem: The DNA sample he’s collected isn’t a perfect specimen, which in turn yields some…less than perfect clones… But fear not, Dr. Fetus knows how to solve this problem. He creates a bunch of ruthless test chambers and starts sending all of the clones he’s created through them, in order to weed out the crap clones from the good ones. The specimens start out looking nothing like Meat Boy, but over time that grotesquely lovable face that Dr. Fetus hates so much, starts to emerge. Perfect clones are just on the horizon and after they’re done…who knows what happens next? Probably something to do joyously with torturing and killing lots of Meat Boys for the hell of it! About The Game: Dr. Fetus` Mean Meat Machine provides the perfect combination of classic puzzle-gameplay and hardcore platforming elements that Super Meat Boy is known for. Puzzle your way through beautiful hand-crafted worlds and more than 100 puzzle-levels, filled with creative traps and hazards. At the end of each world, prepare for a gruesome boss fight that will provide the ultimate challenge. Puzzle your way through familiar Super Meat Boy and Super Meat Boy Forever locations like the picturesque forest, the hospital, and salt factory in a fresh classic puzzle game-inspired format. However, in Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine, matching at least 4 clones of the same kind and creating awesome combos isn't enough – you'll also have to avoid lethal hazards and traps, such as sawblades, rockets and pendulums. It’s a demented and hardcore spin on the classic puzzle formula you know and love!

Based on the rider selected, playing and controlling your rider is now different. It's easier to reach maximum speed and to take certain trajectories tightly with a rider like Wout van Aert than with PrimoÃƒ…Ã‚Â¾ RogliÃƒ„Ã¯Â¿Â½. But be careful, because the lower the Downhill and Agility ratings of your cyclist, the more control you need! STAND OUT FROM OTHER RIDERS To add more immersion to the core of Tour de France 2023, we added two new bibs this year. You can now see and wear the """"super combative"""" bib and the best team bib. Prove you deserve to wear these distinctions by showing your panache! As in real life, riders can form a """"grupetto"""" to make a breakaway or if they have fallen behind. This helps to limit damage during difficult stages and conserve energy for future stages or the end of the race. SMOOTHER RACES In Tour de France 2023, trajectories and collisions have been redesigned so you can navigate within the peloton more easily. Thanks to these improvements, you can reposition yourself more easily and prepare for the end of the race as ideally as possible. All ratings have been updated based on the results of the riders' last season so that they reflect reality and the latest performances of professional cyclists. The Race of the Moment mode has also been updated with new challenges, races and optimisations that add more variety. There's also a brand-new mode: Downhill of the Moment.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1920/3013b6d4b87338449166288f24b5629f3683d5108933a679.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA14198_00-TDF2300000000000","80%","0","Simulation","0","null","null","Tour De France 2023","TRD","NACON SA","2023-06-08","tour-de-france-2023-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","0","349.80","1","",
"","2025-03-26","“A Painter's Tale: Curon, 1950” is a story about love and resistance, an adventure game about historical memory. The bell tower that comes out of the lake is the last memento of the old village of Curon, flooded by the waters of Lake Reschen in 1950 due to the construction of a dam, despite the protest of the citizens. The plans for the dam started during the Fascist era, opposing the interests of a big industrial group to the wellbeing of the villagers, who were forced to leave their homes and pastures. The main character of the game is a painter visiting today's Curon Venosta, the new village built after the flooding. The painter is dragged into the lake by a mysterious woman and wakes up in the past, in the old village of Curon as it was before the flooding. Around him, the villagers witnessed the tragic event at the time. “A Painter's Tale: Curon, 1950” is not a documentary, but a tale where history and fiction overlap.","2025-03-11","/game/87985","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1716/c3aa68af3efef2665a3a84591b71edbcfaf06ad776f3c124.png?w=200","2","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4977-CUSA43337_00-0863458994340705","50%","2","Adventure","98","null","null","A Painter's Tale: Curon, 1950","TRD","FANTASTICO STUDIO SRL","2023-06-07","a-painters-tale-curon-1950-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","245.00","0","122.50","1","",

This edition also contains ""The Lethal Script"" case that will have the detectives investigating a movie industry mystery on The Peak Hotel. Put on your headphones and step back into the past. Use the voices you hear to return to crime scenes, tracking down each individual involved and solving the cases. But where do the voices come from? Can you trust what you hear? And what's the mysterious thread weaving all of these cases together? A Unique Case-Solving Experience Discover the truth hidden in the voices from the past. Step through time as you use our device to eavesdrop on conversations from past crime scenes. Every clue, every move, and every motive will be presented in the form of audio. Rather than controlling any one character, you only need listen to their conversations, following along as the story evolves. Use the information you hear to match names to voices and determine how everything (and everyone) is related. Can you discover the truth?

"","2025-03-26","""Listen carefully, this might be the most important thing you will ever buy in your entire life. This game is worth every penny, and you should buy it right now, why? Firstly because the whole story was written during a live-stream, which makes the story totally nonsensical! If this doesn't convince you remember that not only do I have a gun, I also know all your secrets. This is of course a joke, I do not know your secrets, yet. The game even features some of the most famous actors to have ever lived, including ""Thrash94Gaming"" you might know him for never being in a movie. ""LaraCroft86"" you might know her for also not being in any movie. Lastly but mostly least ""Gamer Jeffro"" for his famous role as Asa Gray in the video game that you are about to buy. Thankfully this game also includes two actors from Kimulator's Films, sadly they also were never in anything noteworthy. You might wonder who I am, well I'm Sheesh-Man, I literally come from another planet, I'm like an alien, a spooky sheeshing alien to say the truth. Don't challenge me or I will sheesh your whole family, including your dog, it's not a threat, it's a fact. Now back to the game, it features over 2 hours of video footage of me and my worst enemy Swag-Girl, who even says Swag in 2023? Pft, we all know Sheeshing is the new hip and cool thing to do. This game is an interactive movie telling the story of how I went on earth and became a super-hero or whatever, it's pretty sick if you ask me! Not sick in the sense that you will throw up, but in the sense that it's cool. This my friend was a word play, you can expect this level of humour in the game, may I say it even gets better than this, not a lot, but at least a little bit. The game as a ton of bonus content too! Even a video of Mini the dog taking a shower, can you believe it? I surely can, because it's true and it's literally in the game. Either way, I don't think you need more reasons to buy the game but I will give you another one, this game includes 4 PSN Avatars! Use them to show all your friends that you are indeed the best gamer of the gamers. Now back to the fact that I have a gun. (Reference to the title of the game, get it? Lol) Don't worry, I won't use it. Just remember that I could. Thank you."" - Sheesh-Man 2023","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/2522/cdnhZrkBLmtdE7DFnp4LIXhI.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7603-CUSA41049_00-0081435904286737","30%","0","Action, Adventure, Unique","209.4","null","null","""Buy The Game, I Have a Gun"" -Sheesh-Man","TRD","Kimulator's Films inc.","2023-01-29","buy-the-game-i-have-a-gun-sheesh-man-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","244.30","1","",

Players will be able to fire one powerful - and very effective- musket shot at a time. The weapon must be used wisely because of its long reset time though. Heidelberg 1693 tells its somber story - featuring real locations and historical figures - across multiple paths and endings. Features: - Classic 2D action platformer - Story set in a 17th century uchronia - Unique musket mechanic adds a layer of strategy to the action - Featuring authentic locations and historical figures - Beautifully animated sprites - Animated cutscenes inspired by silent era films - Multiple endings","2025-03-11","/game/92917","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/2708/anNAiq1eVwlvzx1Sqc2RqGQf.png?w=200","3","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5098-PPSA07038_00-7309017860455478","70%","0","Action","158.7","null","null","Heidelberg 1693","TRD","RED ART GAMES","2022-11-17","heidelberg-1693-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","529.00","0","158.70","1","",

Plumb its detestable depths and abominable history. Untangle riddles that bar your perilous path. And flee the hellish halls of The Witch’s House. The Witch’s House, originally released in 2012, falls within the tradition of Japanese horror RPGs with heavy emphasis on puzzle-solving and jump scares. Among other entries in the genre such as Ib and Ao Oni, The Witch’s House surprised fans with pixel-art that conceals truly frightening horror. The Witch’s House is deliberately designed with traps at *almost* every turn--sudden death is unpredictable and it keeps players on their toes. Anything can happen at any time. With completely remastered visuals, The Witch’s House MV will feel fresh to even the most familiar old-school fans. Fans will also be greeted by a new difficulty mode that includes new events upon completion of the base game. - Completely reimagined graphics that make for a beautifully terrifying experience. - Brand new unlockable difficulty mode with new events and dialogue. - Violence and gore that are not recommended for the squeamish. Player discretion advised. - Sudden deaths that lurk around every corner and await every misstep. - Items must be used deliberately as players solve the puzzles for themselves. - Fixed save points (just keep an eye out for the talking black cat). - Convenient controls with diagonal movement.

"","2025-03-26","Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom is a history-driven turn-based strategy set in World War 2. You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies. Possible alternate history flow - what would have happened if the Allies followed the ideas of Operation Unthinkable and went to war against the USSR in 1946? Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Advanced army manager - choose the composition of your forces. Acquire new units, upgrade or dismiss the outdated ones. Make sure that your forces have all the necessary tools for the upcoming battle. Real WW2 heroes - assign historical personalities to your armies and get access to special skills. Realistic 3D graphics - study the battle map and take advantage of 3D graphics, featuring volumetric terrain and physically-simulated movement of units. Attention to detail - game created by a team passionate about WW2 history.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0910/r28qdLdXatQ9aY1ux0GGRoQl.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA34476_00-8237173962609670","50%","0","Strategy","472.05","null","null","Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom","TRD","Klabater","2022-09-22","strategic-mind-fight-for-freedom-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","524.50","1","",

"","2025-03-26","Construction Simulator has returned – larger and more impressive than ever! Fulfil your ambition to become a successful construction entrepreneur by establishing your business from scratch, assisted by your mentor Hape. Tackle intriguing projects of different sizes and requirements that help you increase your income, so that you're able to add even more powerful machinery to your vehicle fleet. Along the way, diverse clients will test your abilities as you navigate challenges, making every task a test of your skill set. Get ready to showcase your process as you tackle a variety of construction challenges in this dynamic and engaging adventure! Start your business on two individual maps inspired by landscapes in the USA and Germany. Each of them offers its own campaign that helps you climb the ladder of success. Friedenberg is based on picturesque cities of Southwest Germany, and features enchanting rolling hills and scenic riversides. Here, your objective is to contribute to the design of renewable energy solutions and enhance the local urban infrastructure throughout the campaign. Beyond these significant undertakings, you'll encounter diverse tasks that allow you to put every piece of equipment you earn to the test. Sunny Haven, on the other hand, is a truly American-style harbor city that you have to revitalize to put its tourism industry back on track. Altogether, more than 90 exciting contracts are waiting to be completed on both maps, so you can be sure you'll always come across something new to explore! Dive back into the construction scene with a vehicle fleet that will leave you awestruck by its sheer size! Take your pick from a selection of over 80 machines from official licensing partners, all of which are faithful virtual recreations of their real-life counterparts. Look forward to a colorful mixture of vehicles from previous installments of the beloved franchise, as well as completely new additions to the game. The same goes for the manufacturers behind them: In addition to the well-known Construction Simulator partners Atlas, BELL, Bobcat, Bomag, CASE, CaterpillarÃƒ‚Ã‚Â©, Kenworth, Liebherr, MAN, Mack Trucks, Meiller-Kipper, Palfinger, Still, and the Wirtgen Group, you now have the opportunity to put machines by Benninghoven of the Wirtgen Group, CIFA, DAF, Doosan, Nooteboom, Scania, Schwing Stetter, and Wacker Neuson to use. Plus, while creating your character, you can choose an outfit featuring officially licensed personal protection equipment from our new partner Engelbert Strauss. You think that's everything? Far from it: The updates Construction Simulator has been provided with since its release not only contain patches, but free extra content too. Several new machines have found their way into the game, including the innovative wheel excavator EW100 by Wacker Neuson and a practical service vehicle for refueling and repairing. New tools and features in the form of enhanced terrain reworks, increased vehicle hall capacity, and a handy flashlight are also part of the updates. And since we don't want you to get bored by taking on the same jobs over and over again, an entirely new tourist area as well as various seasonal contracts have been added on top. All in all, with the initial base game and its updates, Construction Simulator now offers you more than 100 contracts, over 90 machines, and, consequently, almost endless construction fun, which you can experience together with up to three friends in the multiplayer mode. Sounds good, doesn't it? Then what are you waiting for?

I'm sad and single, I have some friends online, but that's it. My main hobby is playing video games and sharing pictures with my friends from the interweb. They all like my pictures and say I'm special and funny. I recently created a dating profile because my friend told me I could get some action if I did, I might not be an action star like the people in the movies, but I still like action in my life because action is fun. I used one of my best pictures for my profile! It's super hot and shows off my beautiful mustache, which my mom says is a lady magnet. I thankfully got a date with a girl named Michelle. She's a bit too young for my liking, I prefer people that are over 70 years old. Just a preference, but I'm willing to give her a try. Can you please help me not ruin this date with her? Please? I will sometimes ask for your help on how to react or what to do. Thank you!

"0","2025-03-26","A visual novel about an abusive relationship, idealization, and intimacy. Live a summer of dysfunctional love through branching storylines, twists, sudden changes, and a special mechanic where you choose which senses to use with your boyfriend. In these moments, you will learn about him, his personality, and his past, making you question everything. Milky Way Prince is a semi-autobiographical story entirely designed, programmed, illustrated, and scored by a young author, Lorenzo Redaelli. ""During my experience with a borderline partner, I thought that falling in love with him was like becoming part of a binary star system. It’s the rarest, most precious thing in the universe – but the closer they get the more unstable they become."" ""My idea was to create an immersive experience where the player is asked to try to understand the dynamics of this unusual relationship. The character you interact with adapts their behavior to yours – using academic terminology, they could set up “rage tests”, “love bombing"", or otherwise guilt trip you. The plot's branching storyline is guided by variables such as “submission” and ""interest” that fluctuate at each interaction.""","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/3109/LkJfZKSVEhP8H7WVTwUzyOAx.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4977-PPSA06752_00-1147686809756156","50%","0","Adventure","210","null","null","Milky Way Prince – The Vampire Star","TRD","FANTASTICO STUDIO SRL","2022-06-20","milky-way-prince-the-vampire-star-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","262.50","1","",

With the aid of weapons, spells and tonics, and the guidance of the magical and mysterious Beatrice, you will explore a dark and dangerous world, battle hideous monsters, and topple incredible bosses. A young girl wakes up in a dimly lit dungeon without any of her memories. Surrounded by horrible, bloodthirsty monsters, the girl is rescued by the magician, Beatrice. With Beatrice’s help, the girl goes on a perilous journey to find answers, and unlock the secrets of the Lost Ruins. Combat Combat in Lost Ruins is in real time, and can be both fast and methodical. Slash away at enemies, burn them to a crisp, or even deflect their projectiles back at them. Arm yourself with a variety of swords, axes and other assorted medieval weaponry, and hack monsters to pieces. For those with an affinity for magic, Lost Ruins allows you to cast a variety of spells through wands, tonics, and scrolls. Burn monsters, freeze bosses, and heal yourself when in danger. Choose what works for your playstyle, and make a magic casting character that’s totally your own. Using the Environment As you explore the depths of Lost Ruin’s dimly lit dungeons, you will find that while everything around you might bring about your death, you can also use the environment around you to your advantage. Elements within the world will react with other elements realistically. Flammable liquids will be set ablaze when in contact with lit lanterns. Ice magic will freeze bodies of water, making them dangerously cold. The more you understand the environment and how to use it to your advantage, the more dangerous you will become. Equipping Yourself The world of Lost Ruins is a dangerous one, and being armed to the teeth with awesome weaponry is sometimes not enough. That’s where accessories come in. Accessories are unique pieces of equipment with all manner of effects. One accessory might protect you against fire, while another might heal you when you’re poisoned. The right combination of accessories can open a world of strategic options for your adventure.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1310/JdwA9IKvVUJ3x7jC9AxwfEu1.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3919-CUSA29270_00-LOSTRUINSEU00000","50%","0","Action, Adventure","279.6","null","null","Lost Ruins","TRD","DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","2022-06-05","lost-ruins-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","349.50","1","",

"","2025-03-26","Take part in a roller coaster of emotions with Louise embarking on a road trip of a lifetime through the late 1960s USA, trying to show her son Mitch how to navigate the often cruel modern world. What Does It Take To Be A Mother? Telling good from bad was never easy, all the less when you're a single mum in her late 20s with a clever 8-year-old under your care. Each choice you make in the crucial few moments we all know may change our lives for good in a split of a second, influence what kind of person Mitch turns out to be and what values shall guide him once he becomes his own man. Why Are You Who You Are? Find clues as to why Louise’s life is what it is today, take crucial decisions no other person would be strong enough to stomach and show Mitch what he needs to see in order for him to become independent, suave and brave enough to conquer the day. Everything Has Consequences Your decisions REALLY matter! To keep track of Mitch’s growth as a person, each choice you make adds positive or negative points to three key statistics: Righteousness, Confidence, and Relations. These influence which type of ending Mitch will reach at the end of the game - there are 9 unique endings in total! Everybody Has Their Story The 1960s were tumultuous in more ways than one - the Summer of Love, the Vietnam War, the survivors and the losers of the great upheaval in history. Canned Heat was “Going Up the Country” while Bob Dylan asked “How does it feel” to have no home and live on the street. Travel across the country and meet a plethora of characters that may help or may dissuade Louise from her goals - including the most controversial groups many thought long gone. Best Month Ever! Official Soundtrack included! It'll Be The Best Month Ever! is a complete collection of 29 beautiful, expressive, folk, country and jazz-inspired melodies prepared by the composer JÃƒ„Ã¢„Â¢drzej BÃƒ„…czyk (Pan JÃƒ„Ã¢„Â¢dras). The stunning, nearly 80-minute original soundtrack is an excellent addition to the narrative adventure game, creating the musical soundscape of the main characters' journey across the 1960s USA. CONTENT WARNING The game includes scenes and storyline elements that some people may find disturbing and emotionally heavy. It contains offensive language, sexual themes, and allusions to them, a fictional depiction of racism and violence against various groups of people. Player discretion is advised.

In This War Of Mine, you do not play as an elite soldier, rather as a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with a lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The Complete Edition consists of a full version of the base game, The Little Ones DLC and all three narrative-driven scenarios, each showing a different perspective of war. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During a war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine: Complete Edition consists of: - This War of Mine: Final Cut – a full version of the base game - The Little Ones DLC – exploring the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child - Father's Promise DLC tells the story of a family’s struggle to preserve the last pieces of humanity in times of despair and cruelty. - The Last Broadcast DLC explores the role of truth in a time of despair. As a radio operator broadcasting in a war-torn city, face the dilemma of whether there is a line beyond which the truth can be sacrificed. - Fading Embers DLC that portrays the story of Anja. Living in a warzone and carrying a heavy burden, Anja wrestles with herself to answer the question of what is more important―the survival of mankind’s legacy or the survival of a person","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2915/xhuKnLjwz0VYDGPpUDFsEHtO.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-PPSA05102_00-0000TWOMCOMPLETE","80%","0","Adventure","141.75","null","null","This War of Mine: Complete Edition","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2022-05-10","this-war-of-mine-complete-edition-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","945.00","0","189.00","0","",

Focus either on efficiency or yield, treating everything as a diligent spreadsheet master - but with an abstract layout system resembling a circuit board to help you design the best connections, nooks and crannies to make your station a resounding engineering success! ECONOMICS, ERRORS AND MORE! A unique economic system provides you with a key objective - make your station efficient and profitable or fail! The normal route of business can be, however, disrupted by a number of disruptions: from hacker attacks to error and malfunctions each module and its system entail in your management of the station. Your production may also simply overload, given the production strain - so plan, execute and design to perfection! EXPLORE UNKNOWN PLANETS There are 3 distinct campaign missions where you need to terraform a given planet, make it habitable and easy to extract resources from. Built with a background narrative, each of these missions enable you to focus on the two game modes in order to build your station in such a way as to successfully fulfill their objectives. Are you going to be the most efficient, the most industrious or have the most graphically appealing modules set-up? Anything goes as long as the mission is successful! ENDLESS DREAMS You can also kick back and focus on building the greatest and either best looking or most efficient station there ever was - within either our Creative or Endless modes built especially for this purpose. orbit.industries blends inspiration from classic science fiction literature, movies, and popular space-opera TV series with actual knowledge and progress achieved in the field of space exploration, space engineering, and orbital stations development.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/0909/FcILE6TDqRKX9oWlXKd9X6M4.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA05565_00-1642117917262637","70%","0","Simulation","174.75","null","null","orbit.industries","TRD","Klabater","2022-04-21","orbitindustries-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","209.70","1","",

Immediately after the events of Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles, you find yourself trapped within the remains of Arzt Memorial Hospital – the hub to organize your inventory and storage cache, level up your character, or just to take a breather before venturing back out into the chaos.

Don’t think death can save you – every time you die, you'll awake trapped in this nexus. Outbreak: Endless Nightmares focuses on extreme replayability by offering multiple character options – each with their own abilities, upgrade paths and more! Each time you venture into the anomaly, it’ll change and become increasingly difficult as you grow in power. You'll need to think carefully about what weapons, healing items, and other supplies you'll bring along. If you're lucky, you may find storage caches that give you access to your expanded inventory, and offer an opportunity to restock. But it's all on you to search your environment for supplies.

Set in a ruthless world where any form of dissent is mercilessly crushed, the story follows a man who has dared to challenge the existing order. Set out on a lifelong journey and become an individual able to carve out their own destiny... But remember that freedom never comes cheap. Life in the Great Arknian Empire is harsh and its hardest Lot is yours by the circumstance of birth. You are a commoner, holding no rights and no title. To seize your fate and become the rightful heir to the legacy of the Brante family you will have to come to grips with ossified tradition and prejudice. Embarking on a life-long journey from one's birth until true death, you will have to endure great upheavals, face adversity, and make many difficult choices. Every decision will affect not only the protagonist, his family, and loved ones, but may even topple the foundation of the Empire itself. Key features At the turn of time Every imperial citizen's life is predetermined by their estate. The deities known as the Twin Gods have bestowed this truth to the world, dividing mortals into Lots.

You may accept your fate without question, but it is also in your power to change the cosmic order that governs all. Your choice is not an illusion Divided into chapters, the game keeps track of the player's deeds, the skills they acquired, as well as other overlapping circumstances that shape a unique plotline for each playthrough.

To protect your family and loved ones, to impose the rule of the Emperor and make a fortune, or to try and change the world as you see fit...

Fight for your life One man is anything but omnipotent in this realm yet under your guidance, Sir Brante may become a person who can endure every trial fate throws at him and rewrite the very laws that govern his world! Develop and train your character, leveling up such traits as determination, sensitivity, and endurance. All of the hero's skills, starting with those acquired in infancy, will affect his personality, worldview, and relationships, ultimately unlocking new talents and possible storylines. Find your own path The first complete walkthrough can take you upwards of 15 hours! Numerous branching paths that affect the unfolding story will make every playthrough a unique experience: become a noble judge, learn the ways of the inquisition, plot a revolution as a member of a secret society, or embrace an entirely different purpose. Be brave and fate itself shall bend to your will!

A dreamlike journey into a surreal world of the artist’s own creations where the atmospheric gameplay provides mysteries to discover, puzzles to solve and artistic landscapes to explore. GAMEPLAY You find yourself on an evolving island. As you investigate your surroundings, the island will start to change. The appearance of a ship, the rise of a lighthouse, each mystery you uncover and puzzle you solve will unfold new wonders and unveil new places to explore.

This intriguing world within the canvas holds more mysteries than even the artist intended. STORY Prague July 20th 1945 The city of Prague was under siege, ravaged by war. Buildings were falling, churches were burning, and everything was to be washed away forever. A painter lived there, isolated from the outside world. The worse the terrors of war became, the more the artist obsessively painted beautiful landscapes as a contrast to the evil he had witnessed.

He then sat down in front of the artist; to offer him a deal. The chance to enter one of his own creations, far away and free of war. But he would have to find his way back out before midnight, or else his soul would become trapped in the canvas forever.

"","2025-03-26","In this game you abstractly follow the narration of a young man who slowly but surely becomes insane. This leads you straight into the middle of an exciting murder case and a murder mystery unfolds while you listen to the testimonies of witness, friends and relatives. The whole game is somewhat Christmas flavored - however, don't get yourself comfortable, the game not going to give you a nice and warm feeling but rather confront you with a cold and harsh reality as the thrilling storytelling of the game will leave you with a cold shiver down your spine. The game is a must have for any true fan of thrillers and anyone how enjoys a murder mystery that goes beyond the normal story telling. How does the gameplay work? You will play as a free-floating ghost like creature. Basically, as the soul of someone who is experiencing the story. You are very small in comparison to the surroundings and can fly freely through the area. You start by exploring the area and enjoying the feeling of flying as well as the gentle yet mysterious background music. Soon after starting to explore, you will find the first memory piece. You can collect the memory pieces to continue with the story and to advance with the overall narration. The story talks about a young boy, about his live and about how everything changes. It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. The first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become. Once you have finished a chapter by collecting all memory pieces and finishing the overall story of a level you will continue into the next chapter.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/0713/MdykcFBrVbTsRxO86dAiH7Uh.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6556-CUSA31171_00-6244328745700174","45%","0","Horror, Unique, Simulation","297.5","null","null","Murder Diaries 3 - Santa's Trail of Blood","TRD","EpiXR Games UG","2021-12-16","murder-diaries-3-santas-trail-of-blood-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","595.00","0","327.25","1","",

"","2025-03-26","The airport is a place that never sleeps. With departures, arrivals and the continuous hustle and bustle of passengers, there is rarely an opportunity for a break. In Airport Simulator: Day & Night, your challenge is to keep the wheel turning and ensure that everything in the airport runs smoothly around the clock. Firstly, you will need to take care of fleet and baggage management to handle transporting passengers and the ever-increasing number of aircraft from various airlines. In addition, security checks, airport hygiene and maintenance are also crucial and need to be well managed. Depending on the time of day and weather conditions, your tasks will vary. For example, in frosty weather, the de-icing of wings becomes the main focus of attention. These are just some of the important parts of running your organization as you compete against other international airport competitors. Goal-oriented management, satisfied staff, and happy passengers - will you achieve your goals through hard work and commitment? In the beginning, you will take over many tasks yourself. Over time, you will be able to delegate tasks to your airport staff. For now, it is time to roll up your sleeves; in Airport Simulator: Day & Night, there is always something to do! Day & Night: Manage your airport at any time of the day and make sure everything runs smoothly. Changing weather: Safety comes first, and processes need to be followed in any weather condition. E.g. Taking care of de-icing wings. Managing the plane: Different types of aircraft all require inspection and cleaning of the interior. Busy traffic: Numerous detailed vehicles and aircraft on the huge grounds guarantees a realistic airport experience. Different vehicles can be steered by yourself. Intelligent AI and personnel system: Pilots, stewardesses, mechanics, taxiway staff all support you in your tasks. A good organization and overview are the key to success. Varied missions: Tasks such as de-icing, loading and unloading the aircraft, refuelling, transport and cleaning are just some of your extensive activities. Realism: Every action requires a reaction. Damage to vehicles or sick employees - everything is simulated.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/0308/IVM9kIxUBZuoNwpeWE6f1DoI.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8935-CUSA29671_00-AIRPORTDAYPS4EU0","70%","0","Simulation","209.8","null","null","Airport Simulator: Day & Night","TRD","Iridium Media Group GmbH","2021-11-18","airport-simulator-day-night-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","314.70","1","",

"","2025-03-26","Before he was the world’s greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naivetÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCOFROGWARESUAK","85%","0","Adventure, Action","236.25","null","null","Sherlock Holmes Chapter One","TRD","FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","2021-11-15","sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1575.00","0","236.25","1","",

"","2025-03-26","You’re not special. You’re not a hero. Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet. There is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective. ABOUT Tails Noir is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation. Tails Noir is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person. GAMEPLAY Tails Noir’s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you. As Howard, you will: • Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth • Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be • Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver • Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss • Be a raccoon FEATURES Post-noir dystopia Tails Noir’s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It’s a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better. Stunning visuals The breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. Evocative and unforgettable soundtrack Original doom jazz soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab features an innovative combination of classic jazz and electronic music. Tails Noir’s OST is expertly crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape that serves and enhances storytelling.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/1110/e7e436091311d50c470f180371c1e721a218f1a6fa3bd9de.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2187-PPSA03218_00-BACKBONEOPS5SIEE","65%","0","Role-Playing","0","null","null","Tails Noir","TRD","Raw Fury AB","2021-10-28","tails-noir-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","0","306.25","1","",

"","2025-03-26","Evertried is an isometric, tactical rogue-lite set in the afterlife where the player ascends a mysterious tower by defeating enemies in turn-based combat. Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny. In Evertried, the player’s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don’t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3919-CUSA28219_00-EVERTRIEDPS4EU00","60%","0","Strategy, Strategy, Strategy","209.7","null","null","Evertried","TRD","DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","2021-10-20","evertried-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","279.60","1","",

Fight countless enemies with a huge selection of gun turrets (in the form of comic heroes) and additional helpers (mines, air support, block wall) on more than 60 maps. Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters! TD features: - Shop system for buying and improving towers and for purchasing special weapons - 9 defense towers, capable of improvement (2 improvements each within a battle) - Support towers, special attacks and elements that can be placed along the path - Unique opponents - 54 unlockable maps + 9 bonus maps - Tower control (control of direction and aim of a tower) - Power-up for each tower: damage, rate of fire, range - can be placed along the path: mine, adhesive cream fence, block wall - Supporters: fire power expansion, range expansion - Global help: area bomb, atomic bomb, air support","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/2613/bdp8UO0BPwqmISYwRdksYEMK.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5974-CUSA29997_00-6112691195656490","20%","0","Strategy","122.5","null","null","Swamp Defense 2","TRD","THOMAS CLAUS UND FRANK MENZEL","2021-09-09","swamp-defense-2-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","175.00","0","140.00","1","",

"","2025-03-26","Order of Battle: World War II is a turn-based strategy game with an impressive variety of scenarios and theatres of war. Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders – split between Generals, Pilots and Captains – is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow. FEATURES Classic turn based, hex based gameplay with an intuitive UI and great depth. Play in dynamic campaigns with unit carryover and multiple ""what-if"" scenarios. A rich 3D world with detailed animations and effects 20 different Specializations give a unique feel to each faction including Banzai Charge, Bushido Code and even the Manhattan Project. Over a thousand different unit types, including infantry, tanks, ships and aircraft, each with unique visuals and animations Attach unique commanders to your units to give them additional offensive and defensive bonuses A deep but intuitive supply system allowing breakthroughs & encirclements.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1812/6vfDdBCOEsxM7cwPshdYlmYB.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4136-CUSA14680_00-OOBWWII000000001","51%","0","Strategy","342.51","null","null","Order of Battle: World War II","TRD","Slitherine","2021-08-19","order-of-battle-world-war-ii-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","342.51","1","",

"","2025-03-26","Ai is a grade-schooler in 1990s Japan who is about to realise just how isolated she is. Forced to play children’s games in a world of never-ending dusk, Ai is hunted by otherworldly entities as her life hangs in the balance. When these horrors begin to bleed into the real world, Ai must accept that she has only three choices: hide, run, or die. ÃƒÂ¢—†Evolving gameplay Test your courage in a dangerous game of hide and seek before initiating a terrifyingly twisted version of tag with abominations not of this world. Use the items you’ve gathered to flee your sunset hell, but be sure to remember the paths you’ve taken or risk being trapped there forever. ÃƒÂ¢—†Japanese locations ablaze with a haunting, beautiful sunset Experience an unnerving mix of beauty, fear and nostalgia in a mysterious world where a Japanese house, school and hospital are all inexplicably connected. Explore corridors dyed twilight crimson, witness the ethereal glow of -amber through paper walls of a traditional Japanese house and escape creeping black shadows in hospital rooms where the power is somehow always out. ÃƒÂ¢—†Hide or die 10-year-old Ai has no defensive measures to defeat the enemies you face; instead, you must take advantage of each spirit’s weaknesses to survive. Hold your breath to sneak past blind foes or dash past deaf ones as quick as your little legs can carry you. And if you can’t get away in time, prepare to suffer a dire fate at the hands of unimaginable forces. ÃƒÂ¢—†A tragic tale of friendship, betrayal and facing your demons Mute and anxious, Ai is grateful when she makes a group of friends to play with. But it turns out that the ghostly apparitions trapped in the world of dusk aren't the only things she has to contend with; ghosts can be cruel, but children even more so. Your classmates harbour dark thoughts and harrowing secrets that you must uncover to progress. Throughout the game, Ai will learn more about her new friends than perhaps she'd care to know... ÃƒÂ¢—†If only there were another way… Upon clearing the game, another ending will become available to you. What story will this new path unveil? Slipping back into the terrifying world of Yuoni will see you face considerably more challenging foes for an even greater reward.","2025-03-11","/game/97173","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/1901/3dX5u5FMCL78N4VpYUXkQPfD.png?w=200","3","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5438-PPSA02512_00-CHOR000000020DEU","50%","0","Adventure, Horror","332.5","null","null","Yuoni","TRD","Chorus Worldwide Games","2021-08-18","yuoni-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","665.00","4","332.50","1","",

There are also many official races (Paris-Roubaix, Paris-Nice, LBL, etc.) More realistic peloton We have redesigned the actions of riders in the peloton to recreate the behaviour found in real races: -Favourites ride closer to each other - The yellow jersey is better placed at the front of the peloton -Pursuit of the early breakaway is more realistic with fewer teams getting involved, which gives the leader's team the upper hand, just like in real life - Teams that want to catch the breakaway but don't attack or that reduce the peloton in the race on the flat now have consistent behaviour Revamped objectives Before the start of each stage, you can now set the objective for each rider thanks to a new ""Select Rider"" page, which includes all the information you need to make a choice (ranking, role, race-day condition). Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race. A new recovery mechanic Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating. The lower the rating, the more the recovery profile penalises the race-day condition.","2025-03-11","/game/109504","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/mDRlUb0UyukoAVgxgkjKZ1CF.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA03340_00-TDF2100000000000","85%","0","Sports","314.85","null","null","Tour de France 2021","TRD","NACON SA","2021-07-01","tour-de-france-2021-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","314.85","0","",
"","2025-03-26","TY puts the BOOM in BOOMERANG! TY the Tasmanian TigerÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢ 2: Bush RescueÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢ is the sequel to Krome Studios' charming Australiana-themed videogame. This classic platformer, updated for PlayStationÃƒ‚Ã‚Â®4, features more rangs, more vehicles, more bots, and more EVERYTHING... in an open world Aussie Adventure. Throw boomerangs, bite, smash and glide your way around the Australian Outback and stop the evil plans of the wicked Boss Cass and help the good folk of the little country town of BURRAMUDGEE. This sequel to the popular TY the Tasmanian Tiger is a game on a grander scale. In addition to classic platforming elements, you'll fight Aussie bush fires from a helicopter, drive around Southern Rivers while hanging on to the back of a four-wheel drive and use the bots to defeat enemies and solve puzzles - all while trying to find a variety of different collectables. And now, only on the HD remaster, you can customise TY's looks, and best of all there are two brand NEW never before seen boomerangs. * Explore from the beach to the desert to the billabong and beyond in a huge open world of old-school 3D platforming glory. * Arm yourself with 20 different boomerangs including the classic Ironbark, Flamerang and two NEW rangs! * Brand new photo-mode. * A wide variety of vehicles like the Fourbie, cart, and mechs, too. * 7 Levels of two-player split-screen cart racing. * Improved camera & graphics; including updated shadows, reflections and HD resolutions. * New Gamemode called ""Hardcore Mode"". * Over 25 Trophies, including a Platinum Trophy, plus Speed Run and Time Attack Leaderboards. * Character customisation with NEW skins for TY and paint jobs for the Fourbie! * Audio Director's cut. THE STORY Long ago, a great battle was fought. BOSS CASS sought out five mystic talismans, so he could banish every warm blooded creature, to THE DREAMING. But one brave soul stood up to CASS, and thwarted his quest for the talismans. He risked all, in an effort to save his family and friends. And in the end... he succeeded. CASS was banished for his crimes, and the land was made safe once again. All thanks to the true blue Aussie hero, TY the Tasmanian Tiger, and his friends at BUSH RESCUE. Now, evil stirs again - the little country town of CURRAWONG is under attack, and a hero is needed once more...","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/2806/pNyCZEaU0ikDsYEtK4mLbOvz.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5633-CUSA26866_00-7582797769000003","65%","0","Action","330.75","null","null","TY the Tasmanian TigerÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢ 2: Bush RescueÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢ HD","TRD","KROME INTERACTIVE","2021-06-30","ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-2-bush-rescue-hd-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","945.00","0","330.75","1","",

Countless heroes have tried and failed to destroy the ancient spell that holds the castle walls. Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside, guarding the sword shards — the last known thing to be capable of defeating the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure. Although you are not alone — some help could be obtained from the merchants, who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them to disappear... Plan your every step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option. There are two difficulty modes: PAL/NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch. Just like in old NES games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found… Features: - Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming. - Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock. - Randomly generated castle, 216 rooms to overcome. - Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming.

You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.

Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire. Eons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia. Each of them has their own wish, and their own story to tell. Challenge the Story Mode to take your chosen character through their tale, challenging all the others in fierce puzzle battles to assemble all seven Sacred Blossoms!

Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.

"","2025-03-26","Book of Demons takes place in Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book. It’s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics. Book of Demons is not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire. Book of Demons respects your time. It features the Flexiscope engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.","2025-03-11","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307rF0M1QlDJAbRCKhdxfdRGBnLV0aOLFUeaJdZfbef3m4t7VbWxm0zjrLqHnZvB0mtUHph8A09j6Ahffjb8i_4YAYOqxw.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4040-CUSA17378_00-BOOKOFDEMONS0EUR","90%","0","Role Playing Games, Adventure, Action","87.5","null","null","Book of Demons","TRD","505 GAMES S.R.L.","2020-04-29","book-of-demons-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","875.00","0","87.50","1","",

Up to 10 players can simultaneously fight in the Hexadiums, scenarios that are divided into 6 zones, each with its own gravity, different platforms, hideouts and open spaces, that turn them into a frenetic battlefield. In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle.

"","2025-03-26","Grab the Bottle is a quirky puzzle game in which you solve puzzles by stretching your arm through the level. You need to maneuver an ever-extending arm to grab the goal bottle, avoiding anything hazardous on the way. To make things more tricky, Grab the Bottle brings physics and puzzles to the mix. You must grab, pull and drop objects to get to the goal bottle. On the way you will find different kinds of obstacles that need to be dealt with. The story of the game begins in the 50s, somewhere in rural America, where one particularly strong minded baby is taking his first steps and discovers that anything is possible. Especially as he seems to have an infinitely stretchy arm. Grab the Bottle follows the life of this boy, from cradle to grave, solving many levels of puzzles inspired by “real life problems” on the way. Central element to the story is the specific craving for bottles the main character has. 1 player 510MB minimum save size HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

"","2025-03-26","Daydreamer: Awakened Edition is the story of the last human who rouses from an eternal sleep to an unfamiliar Earth. Aliens took over the planet thousands of years ago, and the nameless protagonist was kept in a stasis chamber as a twisted relic to memorialize their victory. However, the mysterious Immortal Gate Keeper liberates her and sets her on a dangerous expedition to the Earth’s core. Be warned though—the aliens will do whatever it takes to get their trophy back, and the Earth is filled with frightening creatures that hunger for human flesh. Shoot your way through the hauntingly beautiful remains of Earth. Created by Roland Studios, a one-man indie development house, Daydreamer is a homage to 16-bit era side-scrolling shooters. Coupled with strategic platforming, high intensity battles, and pets that aid in combat, you wouldn’t want to wake up from this dream.
