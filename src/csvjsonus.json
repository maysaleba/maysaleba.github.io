Sairento VR was designed to be easy to pick up, but tough to master.

The story takes place in the land of Rin during the height of the Age of Sail, following the events that would lead to the greatest war in human history. STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin. POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history. CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle. PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total. This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-04","LowestPrice":"/game/103890","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png?w=200","MainStory":26,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4127-CUSA28517_00-R3PUS00000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8e4bk3jh0U","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":36,"genre":"Adventure, Role Playing Games","PlusPrice":11.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/rise-of-the-third-power","Title":"Rise of the Third Power","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2022-02-10","Slug":"rise-of-the-third-power-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"MainExtra":32,"SalePrice":11.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"79","SaleEnds":"2022-11-19","description":"Buy the digital PS4™ version of STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order™ from PlayStation™Store and download the PS5™ version at no extra cost.

Industry is revolutionized overnight and a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common banner. A few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed. In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-26","LowestPrice":"/game/79553","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/2713/PGj2zMGK2iwwGRJVj2gmObRI.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3686-CUSA18290_00-RISKSYSTEMPS4NA0","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gqQXlqpGHs","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Arcade","PlusPrice":4.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/2713/PGj2zMGK2iwwGRJVj2gmObRI.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/risk-system","Title":"Risk System","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"HIDDEN TRAP","ReleaseDate":"2022-01-11","Slug":"risk-system-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":9.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":4.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"76","SaleEnds":"2022-11-19","description":"Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials is a snarky action-adventure puzzle game with a good dose of humor.

These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness.

Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades. Shadowrun Returns The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Nearly 10 years ago, creator Jordan Weisman returned to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city\u2019s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It\u2019s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge\u2019s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the \u201cFlux State\u201d controls the city of Berlin. It\u2019s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there\u2019s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return\u2026 Shadowrun Hong Kong - Extended Edition HONG KONG.

A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. As an ex-con living in Seattle, you try to make an honest living but when your foster begs you to meet him in China, things turn grim and you find out the police are trying to arrest you. And by arrest, they mean to kill you on sight!

Your ship is your home, and your mission is to keep an eye on its fighting ability to repel enemy attacks; to stay on course, and to effectively collect resources to ensure that both the Queen and soldier bees have enough food; and, of course, to keep an eye on the status of your crew, whose members strive to get into trouble or arrange it.

Or will you choose a safer path? Plan and prepare. Negotiate, barter, fight. Tackle challenges. Suffer losses. Recruit new Heroes. Earn Gold, Supplies and Renown. Be careful: your choices are permanent, as is death. But don't tarry - evil never rests. Tactical Turn-Based Combat Master the tactics of squad-based and turn-based combat to conquer both human and demonic foes. Your enemies will be tough and ruthless; make use of high ground and cover, set up ambushes and coordinated attacks, harness synergies between different Hero classes and skills. Non-Linear Narrative Enjoy a compelling story inspired by Arthurian legend, the Matter of France, and the history of Al-Andalus - with an unusual twist. Make choices in interactive encounters that change every time you play. Written by Jonas Kyratzes (The Talos Principle, Serious Sam 4) and Verena Kyratzes (The Lands of Dream, Serious Sam 4). Hard Mode Suited for only the bravest adventurers. Experience an even greater challenge with complex resource management and tougher enemies. Earn Essence with each run that can be exchanged for Blessings and Curses, adding temporary benefits and burden in equal measure to your next run. Dynamic Leveling Use Renown to level up your Heroes, and choose between a randomized set of new skills or improved attributes. But choose wisely! Select skills with great synergy and balance your party for the road ahead. Equipment Upgrades Seek out towns to improve your arms and armor, or stumble upon hermit artisans in the wild. With every day that passes, the world plunges deeper into darkness, and you will need all the equipment gold can buy. Relics From a peasant's humble luck charm to the legendary sword wielded by Arthur himself, items imbued with magical power are scattered about the world. Some you will be able to purchase from merchants and collectors, but others will have to be earned through acts of heroism - or displays of wit. Spells Rain thunder and brimstone upon your foes! Seek out and gather Soulstones to restore your power and unlock new Spells. Even if defeated, your spirit will retain all of your collected arcane knowledge as you jump into the next dimension. Alternate Dimensions As you jump from one parallel dimension to the next, history is reshaped. Different kings rule the land, changing the encounters, characters, and events. No two worlds are ever quite the same, and each journey will be unique. And should your heroes fall, remember: defeat is not the end, only a new beginning. There are as many worlds as there are stars in the sky. In each stands Camelot; in each there is a Grail. But there is only one Merlin, and his eternal burden is to stand against the horror from beyond. Each world that is saved is saved forever; each world that is lost is lost for good.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-04","LowestPrice":"/game/92277","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png?w=200","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0134-PPSA04467_00-THEHANDMERLINPS5","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":14.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Hand of Merlin","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"VERSUS EVIL, LLC.","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-14","Slug":"the-hand-of-merlin-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":14.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-10","description":"Congratulations!

Guide a dynasty through the centuries, ensuring the security and power of each new generation. Gather new lands and titles to cement your legacy.

If you want to put fear in your enemies, this is the answer. Thanks to very light material, it allows for great manoeuvrability despite its large size. \u2022 Feud Trousers, medium leg protection A set of fairly neutral trousers that goes with the Cyber Warrior Feud set.

This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King\u2019s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter\u2019s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King\u2019s blessing.

Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don\u2019t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-04","LowestPrice":"/game/98461","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4127-CUSA28069_00-EVERTRIEDPS4US00","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImOYOo4RR4","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Strategy, Strategy","PlusPrice":9.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Evertried","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-21","Slug":"evertried-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":9.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-10","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

As Redgi, heir to the Rat Throne, you must restore your broken Kingdom by banishing the merciless Frog Clan and their ferocious leader, Greenwart. As you explore the deceivingly charming world, you\u2019ll encounter a cast of unique companions, ready to aid you in your adventure. And you\u2019ll need all the help you can get, whether that\u2019s new meal recipes, blueprints to forge deadly weapons and armour, or even a land-chugging, armour-plated mole mobile! Overcome your fears. Rescue your brothers. Restore Your Kingdom. Your tail has begun\u2026 Master Brutal Combat From frog zombies to gargantuan grubs - and everything in-between - the Kingdom is awash with danger. To overcome each perilous encounter, you\u2019ll need to study your opponent\u2019s attacks and react accordingly!

Explore a Treacherous Kingdom Fully accompanied by the deep, raspy narrations of Doug Cockle, prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the mediaeval-fantasy Rat Kingdom. Complete side quests and faction hunts for some additional gold-on-the-side, or join forces with a sharp-eyed companion to help even the playing field. Customise your Attack Adapt Redgi\u2019s combat style to the task at hand. Heavy armour may provide better protection but can you really afford to slow down your dodge-roll? And then there\u2019s the question of weapon; axes pack a punch, while spears are quick and nimble. Perhaps you\u2019d prefer the all-round performance of a trusty broadsword? Overcome Savage Boss Fights While danger lurks around every toadstool, you\u2019ll need to keep your wits sharp and your blade sharper when it comes to the devastating boss fights. Cold-blooded in every sense of the word, these oversized amphibians each present their own unique combat challenge, and you\u2019ll need more than a good set of armour to come out on top. Brew Recipes, Craft Weapons, Forge Armour Redgi\u2019s keep is also home to his brothers, Rem-Rem, Bam-Bam and Dug. Rem can cook up a health-boosting feast with ingredients found throughout the world, while Bam can craft new weapons and armors from special blueprints you\u2019ll uncover\u2026 if you look hard enough. And then there\u2019s Dug, who\u2019ll update you about new quests available throughout the Kingdom. Features: - Master brutal combat, inspired by the souls-like genre, featuring dodge-rolls, parry bashes, and fatal executions! - Explore a vast and treacherous Kingdom, comprising six distinct biomes, each with its own hidden paths and secrets. - Immerse yourself in the compelling story, narrated by the deep, raspy Doug Cockle. - Customise your attack style with a vast array of distinct weapons and armour. - Assemble a band of brave companions, ready to aid you on select missions. - Complete side quests to earn additional gold-on-the-side. - Unearth special blueprints to forge new and powerful weapons. - Collect rare ingredients to cook up health-boosting feasts. - Overcome savage boss fights against the Frog Clan\u2019s deadly, oversized generals. - Lose yourself in the gorgeous and lovingly-crafted 2D hand-drawn art style.

The story begins right after the Battle of Kursk, where the game provides the option to import a core force from either the Panzerkrieg or Sandstorm campaign. The first five scenarios are based on the historical 1st Soviet offensive in the Donbass in summer 1943, up to the Leningrad\u2013Novgorod strategic offensive in early 1944. A decisive defeat of the Red Army will eventually allow total victory over the Soviet Union, while failure to do so will turn the campaign away from the Eastern Front and into the Battle of Anzio in Italy.

The campaign begins with the fierce tank battle near Prokhorovka during Operation Citadel, the last grand German summer offensive on the Eastern Front in mid-1943. Following the failure of Citadel the Red Army will almost always be on the offensive. Like in the previous Soviet DLCs, Red Star and Red Steel, Red Storm includes both famous and crucial battles as well as operations that are less known or limited in scope, but still provide unique challenges.

Most core units cannot be used here, and the scenario can be skipped entirely if the player prefers more conventional battles.

In December 1941, a carefully planned strategy is set in motion through a series of major offensives, including a carrier strike on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor. The shock of these surprise attacks is intended to cripple the Allied forces, giving the Japanese army and navy the time needed to establish total hegemony over their opponents. Rising Sun puts the player in command of the Imperial Navy - built around a powerful fleet of battleships and aircraft carriers, as well as the Imperial Army - hardened from years of war with the Chinese. Managing the limited resources available to build a well-balanced force of unique units such as the lethal A6M Zero fighter aircraft and the mighty Yamato battleship class will be the key to a successful outcome of the Japanese offensive.

Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders \u2013 split between Generals, Pilots and Captains \u2013 is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow.

Forget everything you know about first-person shooters: Void Bastards asks you to take charge, not just point your gun and fire. Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you\u2019ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage... Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship\u2019s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive.

Guide your agency through the space race and write your alternate history of space travel - any of the agencies can be the first to land on The Moon if you make the right choices. Manage the numerous challenges faced then and now: \u2022 Create your base with launch pads, research labs, astronaut training facilities, and much more \u2022 Construct your own custom vehicles from hundreds of combinations \u2022 Launch satellites and crewed spacecraft to explore the Solar System \u2022 Run mission control as you solve the various challenges of turn-based missions to earn scientific advancement and public support \u2022 Explore an extensive tech tree and compete or collaborate with other agencies to plot your roadmap to Mars \u2022 Choose from five unique space agencies, each with their own traits, base, vehicles, and spacecraft \u2022 Create your own custom space agency You\u2019re in charge of every element of the journey into space: success rides on your decisions. Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet? Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies? Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars. Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors. Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment. These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue? Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We\u2019ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-04","LowestPrice":"/game/85154","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png?w=200","MainStory":12,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5097-CUSA18503_00-0000000000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gqbz8C8bX0","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":117,"genre":"Strategy","PlusPrice":9.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Mars Horizon","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"THE IRREGULAR CORPORATION","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-17","Slug":"mars-horizon-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"MainExtra":37,"SalePrice":9.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-19","description":"Req.

Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction. Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons. Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race. Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war. Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura. Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene! Every corner of the game\u2019s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games. Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next. For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored. From enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-26","LowestPrice":"/game/69306","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/2913/ezrLujSSqsrrPwQto1UeAWgl.png?w=200","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5729-CUSA20607_00-RAJIANANCIENTEPI","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaSp7L0dSYI","PercentOff":"66%","Completionist":6,"genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":8.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/2913/ezrLujSSqsrrPwQto1UeAWgl.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Raji: An Ancient Epic","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"SUPER DOT COM LTD","ReleaseDate":"2020-10-15","Slug":"raji-an-ancient-epic-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":24.99,"MainExtra":5,"SalePrice":8.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-10","description":"Try your hand at managing an auto racing team!

Like the games that inspired it, Petal Crash features a variety of single player challenges in addition to an intense head-to-head versus mode. The rules are simple - push a block in any direction, and it'll keep going until it hits a wall or another block. If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage! Enter the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire. Eons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia. Each of them has their own wish, and their own story to tell. Challenge the Story Mode to take your chosen character through their tale, challenging all the others in fierce puzzle battles to assemble all seven Sacred Blossoms! Shoot for high scores in Solo Play, racing the clock or rationing limited moves to get the highest rank you can!

As you finally spot the majestic crown of your first red deer through the brush, the feeling is indescribable. EXPLORE RESERVES ACROSS THE WORLD In the Diamond Bundle, you will be able to visit hunting grounds across the globe. Trek through the lavender fields of Parque Fernando, explore the lush snow covered landscape of Yukon Valley, traverse the regal foliage of Cuatro Colinas, or scale past the cloudline in the mountainous Silver Ridge Peaks. In these diverse reserves, you will be able to hunt animals of all shapes and sizes, from grizzly bears and wolves to turkeys, bighorn sheep, ibexes, and pumas. And that only scratches the surface of what these 4 regions have to offer. BRING THE PERFECT EQUIPMENT When tracking your target, you need to bring the best possible equipment for the task, and Diamond Bundle has you covered. Including 5 weapon and equipment packs, you will be able to prepare yourself for any hunting situation. Bring the drilling rifle along for versatility, the MN1890 or M1 for reliability, or the Muzzleloader for that old-time explosive shot.

Colonial Ships Colonial Mercury - Heavy Modern Battlestar The Mercury class battlestar is a pinnacle of Colonial Fleet naval engineering.

Colonial Valkyrie - Support Battlestar The Battlestar Valkyrie is a type of battlestar that would prove popular in the years following the First Cylon War. Its small frame is heavily armed, allowing for a highly maneuverable artillery package. Colonial Viper Mk VII - Modern Space Superiority Fighter The unparalleled Colonial fighter.

These modern basestar utilised an organic hull resin, which allowed structural damage to be repaired quickly.

Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming.

Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don't worry though, you won't be alone!

The combination of words they choose impacts the conversations they have, how genuinely they can connect with their partner, and whether their relationship can survive the night.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-26","LowestPrice":"/game/81269","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0814/3oZj0vP9krkKwfIAsabMc4aR.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5223-CUSA19501_00-USAWESHOULDTALK0","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MotLidp9IxE","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":2,"genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":3.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/0814/3oZj0vP9krkKwfIAsabMc4aR.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"We should talk.","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Whitethorn Digital","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-16","Slug":"we-should-talk-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":6.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":4.19,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-10","description":"Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid - Season Three Pass","SaleStarted":"2022-10-26","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/0622/NWOtp81h3NU3fGbBOUapRje7.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4827-CUSA15145_00-SP00000000000003","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Fighting, Unique","PlusPrice":8.24,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/0622/NWOtp81h3NU3fGbBOUapRje7.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid Season Three Pass","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"nWay","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-14","Slug":"power-rangers-battle-for-the-grid-season-three-pass-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":14.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":8.24,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-19","description":"Gal*Gun 2, the notoriously lewd rail-shooter is back!

Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you\u2019ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage... Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship\u2019s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight.

On her first day at Dudsdale Elementary, 10-year old Jess accidentally gets everybody's favorite collectible card game banned, forcing the kids to take their card battles underground. Troubles arise when mutants from the game invade the real world, and it's up to Jess and friends to stop them. From the award-winning indie game studio, Gambrinous, creators of Guild of Dungeoneering, comes an RPG where battles are played with an epic collectible card game. Cardpocalypse takes you back to the 1990's, a time when computers used floppy disks, and people read magazines for video game cheat codes. You will explore Dudsdale Elementary on a mission to build killer card decks in an effort to defeat the mutants. You will have to trade, earn, wager, change rules and permanently alter cards on your way to victory. \u2022 BE A CHAMPION: Build your decks around the ultra rare Champion cards you earn. Each Champion comes with unique abilities to tailor your deck around. First player to get their opponent's Champion card's health to zero wins the match. \u2022 GO MEGA: Champion cards evolve to their MEGA forms when their health halves, doing more attack damage and gaining new powers. \u2022 CHANGE THE GAME: The kids sometimes use house rules and who knows what the Mutants will change. Throughout the game you will choose the new rules and conditions as well as renaming your favorite cards and giving them upgrades using stickers. Create entirely new cards using the Mega Mutant Power Magazine. But be careful, these decisions are permanent. \u2022 GET SCRAPPY: Adventure throughout the school to unravel the strange occurrences at Dudsdale Elementary. Take on quests to earn cards, stickers, and candy which you can collect and trade with your classmates. Careful, there's no backsies! \u2022 YOU CAN'T COLLECT 'EM ALL: In the end, your decks and rules will be unique to you. Stickers are rare, choices matter, and sometimes you'll have to make a tough decision to get the best cards. \u2022 THE 1990's: Through its totally rad, choice-driven, interactive narrative, Cardpocalypse delivers the experience of being a 90's kid. Boo-ya! \u2022 Now featuring Gauntlet Mode! A roguelike mode where every run is unique. Pick your champion and fight your way through ever more difficult battles. After every win draft new cards, rules and rewards for your deck!

Stay out of the light to avoid the attention of deadly security robots! Leap like a lusty salmon to avoid those zap-happy lasers! Once you've defeated these deadly chambers (or they've defeated you), create your own fiendish death-rooms in Stealth Inc's fully-featured level editor! Additional hardware required for Remote Play.
