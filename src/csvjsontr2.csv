80,2023-04-12,"Embark on a journey to a realm overrun by demons in a new epic RPG from the creators of the critically acclaimed Pathfinder: Kingmaker. Explore the nature of good and evil, learn the true cost of power, and rise as a Mythic Hero capable of deeds beyond mortal expectations. Discover the Story Your path will lead you to the Worldwound, where the opening of a rift to the Abyss has unleashed all-consuming terror across the land. For over a century, the neighboring nations have fought fearlessly, trying to drive the enemy back — but to little avail. Now, you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel, backed by noble paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else entirely? Lead your army and challenge mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will leave you — and the world itself — forever changed. PLAY YOUR HERO, YOUR WAY Create any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset. Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle. FOR EVERY CHOICE, A CONSEQUENCE Your decisions have more weight than ever before. Your goal is clear, but you must forge your own path to it. Who will die, and who will live? Who will stay, and who will go? Make your choices, and watch the world around you change. A NEW WAY TO FIGHT Enjoy two combat modes as you slay your enemies – real-time with pause or turn-based. Switch between them on the fly, so you can always take things as slowly — or as quickly — as you like. The unique Pathfinder ruleset also allows you to perform advanced combat maneuvers, like mounted combat. Use them wisely! GATHER YOUR PARTY A cast of more than 10 unique companions is ready to join your cause. Earn their trust and respect, and they will have your back no matter what dangers lie ahead. And if you get on their bad side, well… Maybe it’s time to part ways. LEAD THE CRUSADE You will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of its demonic scourge. Take command of the crusaders and lead them to victory – both as a strategist, controlling the battle from above, and as a field commander, in a new tactical combat mode. CHOOSE YOUR PATH Explore nine unique Mythic Paths: obtain extraordinary abilities and shape everything that comes next. Your decisions might transform you into a celestial Angel, a raging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, an otherworldly Aeon, a rebellious Azata, a wise Gold Dragon, an insatiable Swarm That Walks — or remain mortal and walk the arduous path toward becoming a living Legend.",2023-03-28,/game/83856,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/0418/aC9jmq4nJFtNWTjUcTW9h23h.png?w=200,54,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6008-CUSA35021_00-3515132086703036,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoCBgO8qS70,50%,191,Role-Playing,199.6,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/0418/aC9jmq4nJFtNWTjUcTW9h23h.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous,Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous,TRD,Postmeta Games Limited,2022-09-28,pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-playstation-tr,https://shope.ee/4V6Frr2RHW,0,499,131,249.5,1

Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You’ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified.

Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They’ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You’ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it. Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead.

As time passes for everyone on board, explore the interwoven lives of the patients and staff; discover something new on each and every playthrough. Welcome to the Hospital It's the summer of 1978, and Casey Beaumaris is trying to make the most of her holidays, when her mum asks her to spend a long weekend helping out at the airborne hospital where she works. Casey prefers the company of books to people, but she agrees, secretly planning to write an article about her visit for the school newspaper. With her trusty notebook at the ready, Casey arrives on board the airship. The staff are overworked as they prepare for the visit of an important official, while the patients react to grief, or deal with active trauma. In the midst of these and many other interlocking and overlapping stories, Casey spends time with the patients, learning about their lives, and, as the stories unfold, discovering what she can do to help. Explore A Living World Within the world of Wayward Strand, time passes for everyone - characters continue their lives without waiting for you to interact with them. In Wayward Strand’s unique narrative structure, the stories of over a dozen characters constantly unfold around you in real time, as you, as Casey, roam freely throughout each day. Choose which story to be a part of by following people, having conversations, and exploring the hospital. The hospital’s residents are an eclectic cast of characters – some charming, some eccentric, some rude – each with their own desires, goals and imaginations. Every character moves and acts of their own accord, at their own pace, on their own timeline - sharing news with each other, arguing, joking, gossiping - or having a chat with Casey when she comes by. Every playthrough gives you the opportunity to discover something you didn’t see previously - what you missed the first time, you might see the second, third, or fifth time around. Your Journey When you see someone, you can follow them, to see where they go and what they get up to. You can eavesdrop on peoples’ conversations, or come into the room and be a part of the discussion. Spending time with particular characters will lead you to new storylines, locations, revelations and resolutions. As the journalist for her school newspaper, Casey keeps track of events and information in her notebook. Players use Casey’s notebook to delve deeper into peoples’ stories, to make new discoveries, and to piece together mysteries.

79,2023-04-12,"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game. In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness. The game’s cutscenes, quirky cast of characters, and the majestic Pacific Northwest vistas have been enhanced for an experience that delivers as much on its visual impact as its unnerving atmosphere.

The Shadowrun Trilogy comprises 3 cult tactical RPG games taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which magic has re-awakened, bringing back to life creatures of high fantasy. Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades. Shadowrun Returns The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Nearly 10 years ago, creator Jordan Weisman returned to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return… Shadowrun Hong Kong - Extended Edition HONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world’s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. As an ex-con living in Seattle, you try to make an honest living but when your foster begs you to meet him in China, things turn grim and you find out the police are trying to arrest you. And by arrest, they mean to kill you on sight! Build your team of Shadowrunners, mercenaries with big personalities who can fight using mystical or technical powers, and turn the tables on the elite corporate and the police.

She leaves a trail of carnage throughout huge, multi-path levels filled with gigantic explosions, more secret areas than we can count, and inhuman foes behind every corner. There’s no regenerating health here; stop taking cover and start running and gunning.

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You’re the perfect candidate for our test chambers!

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.",2023-03-28,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCOFROGWARESUAK,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZXfOVX4J10,65%,,"Action, Adventure",157.15,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/sherlock-holmes-chapter-one,Sherlock Holmes Chapter One,TRD,FROGWARES IRELAND LTD,2021-11-15,sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-playstation-tr,https://shope.ee/1L9E7y1Ue2,1,449,,157.15,1

Written and developed by Variable State, creators of the award-winning Virginia, Last Stop tells three interconnected tales featuring three playable main characters. - Donna, a spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life and her overprotective big sister. Away from home, Donna seeks teenage thrills with her friends Becky and Vivek, but gets more than she bargained for when the trio become unexpected kidnappers in a game of amateur detective gone wrong. - John, an overworked middle-aged single dad. Burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent, John jealously pines after the free and easy life of his twenty-something bachelor neighbour, Jack. When the pair unwittingly fall foul of a vengeful stranger, a cursed artefact threatens to transform their lives forever. - Meena, a ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work. As Meena vies with an upstart colleague for a crucial promotion, something ancient stirs in the basement beneath her workplace. Last Stop is fully voice acted, featuring hours of dialogue and a voice cast of dozens, with performances from some of the brightest talent in the UK today, including Lulu Simpson as Molly Smith.

65,2023-04-12,"Ash of Gods is a tactical turn-based RPG with rich lore and detailed nonlinear storyline about three heroes facing an ancient mythical evil. Captain Thorn Brenin, the guard Lo Pheng and scribe Hopper Rouley don’t yet know that the Reapers have returned and are planning to drown the world in blood so they can awaken the slumbering gods. The story can change at any time depending on your choices, sometimes leading to a character’s death. This won’t end the game, however, as the narrative continues without the hero but takes into account the consequences of his demise on future events. Don’t rely on a single tactic or a powerful team to win the game – the AI in Ash of Gods adapts to your gaming style and forces you to be more cunning!

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.

63,2023-04-12,"You’re not special. You’re not a hero. Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet. There is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective. ABOUT Backbone is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation. Backbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person. GAMEPLAY Backbone’s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you. As Howard, you will: • Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth • Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be • Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver • Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss • Be a raccoon FEATURES Post-noir dystopia Backbone’s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope.

46,2023-04-12,"Praey for the Gods is a boss climbing open world adventure game where you play as a lone hero sent to the edge of a dying frozen world to discover the mystery behind a never-ending winter. Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to. Scale Massive Beasts ------------------------------- Overcome impossible odds to climb atop and defeat the massive beasts that are bound to this land. Climb, Glide, Swim ------------------------------- You can climb on virtually anything you can get your hands on, from ruins and mountains to the massive beasts that inhabit the land. Ascend to the tops of mountains and then glide over the open world to reach previously inaccessible locations. Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don't stay in too long or your swim could become your last. Explore, Craft, and Survive ------------------------------- You'll arrive on a frozen island with only the clothes on your back -- it's up to you to survive. Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn't the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait. Make Your Path ------------------------------- Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course. Unravel the Mystery ------------------------------- Why won't the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to. A Beautifully Frigid World ------------------------------- Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog. The remnants of an ancient civilization lie before you, but don't let awe turn into carelessness -- snow storms can crop up at any moment and bury you in a blizzard. Luckily, you can leave footprints in the snow and follow your footsteps back if you are lost.",2023-03-28,/game/64731,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png?w=200,6,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1863-PPSA02191_00-0442182297085207,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzDl2THyF4w,50%,18,Unique,142.5,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/praey-for-the-gods,PRAEY FOR THE GODS,TRD,No Matter Studios LLC,2021-12-14,praey-for-the-gods-playstation-tr,https://shope.ee/2VLBVufQ48,1,285,12,142.5,1

,2023-04-12,"This DLC contains one Legendary Hunter, two Legendary weapons, and one Legendary consumable: - Scaramuccia (Hunter) - Opera Glasses (Winfield M1873C Marksman) - Macchinista (Sparks Pistol) - Spaccagambe (Concertina Trip Mine). Scaramuccia’s trinity mask intimidates any audience, but the many faces behind the mask are quick to perform the fool, the friend, or the villain. Whichever he senses will put a room at ease, or compel it to serve his will. The three-faced mask always conceals which way he looks, confusing predator and prey alike until his next move. It’s a mask that has only been seen once before: worn by a gifted harlequin, who was the leading act of a renowned three-man troupe. The troupe’s director kept the harlequin caged between shows, spreading rumors of grotesque disfigurement and urging people to join the audience for a glimpse beneath the mask. The third of the troupe was the bard, who drew people in with songs of sorrow and sympathy for the harlequin’s disfigurement, before entrancing that same crowd with accompaniments to the troupe’s one-man shows. Many who came to see the plays clamored for a chance to peek at the harlequin’s face, trying to confirm the irresistibly horrifying descriptions the rumors spoke of. But no such chance came, and none could ever find what lair the troupe held the harlequin in between shows. With the show’s success, the director’s clothing grew more lavish and the bard’s guitar more ornate, yet the harlequin’s single costume tore new holes every day. Poverty only added to both the spectacle and pity for the alleged freak, and a freak show proved to draw a greater paying audience than theatre. Then at the peak of the show’s success, the director, bard, and harlequin all vanished without trace. Some weeks later, two bodies were found in the canal stripped of their clothes and with faces too grotesque to identify. Now, amongst the torment of the Bayou, the troupe’s sole survivor christens himself “Scaramuccia”. On the hunt, his finely crafted demeanor shifts and relaxes: relishing not the hunt, but the accursed swamps themselves. Perhaps peeling away the mask would reveal a face less akin to his fellow hunters, and more like what he hunts.",2023-03-28,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/3113/Trtpg36s1rJQGThKdZOmPA15.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-THEHUNTGAME00050,,30%,,"Shooter, Action, Shooter",69.3,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/3113/Trtpg36s1rJQGThKdZOmPA15.png,,Hunt: Showdown - Commedia Della Morte,TRD,Crytek Gmbh,2023-02-21,hunt-showdown--commedia-della-morte-playstation-tr,,1,99,,69.3,0

ENGAGE IN TACTICAL NAVAL BATTLES • A ship is safe in a harbor, but that’s not what ships are made for. Fight in tactical turn-based naval battles on a hexagonal grid of epic proportions. Use your wits when raiding a convoy or a settlement. Victory is determined by a clever combination of your ship’s distinct armament with the varying and rough conditions of the sea. UPGRADE YOUR FLEET • It is your job to maintain and upkeep a formidable fleet before facing the cannon hail of those mighty warships lurking in the seas. Combining distinct upgrades of your ship’s basic gear, such as weaponry, hull, mast, or figurehead allows for more than 360 unique loadouts. MEET YOUR CREW’S NEEDS • As an elected captain of the ship, it is your responsibility to split the spoils and riches with your crew. Agreeing on so-called ‘articles of capture’ clearly define the objectives you embark on before leaving port. Remember the whispers of mutiny below the decks can lead to nasty outcome. After all, you are an elected captain and not placed by the grace of the Lord. PARLEY WITH INFAMOUS PIRATE LEGENDS • On your journey to become the most fearsome, most glorious pirate captain, you will have the opportunity to get to know several historic pirates. Choose your foes and companions wisely… COMMAND HISTORICAL SHIPS • Featuring 18 unique types of ships such as Ship of the Line, Frigate, War Galleon and many more. DROWN IN QUESTS • Sink more than 25 hours into stories set in the Golden Age of Piracy. The world is your oyster after all. Governors and fellow pirate companion provide you with valuable questlines where a few doubloons can be made. Also don’t forget to seek out the local tavern and eavesdrop on the latest rumors. A bottle of rum loosens the tongue, showing the way to treasures otherwise hidden…",2023-04-11,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1516/gmXJznLBssugZ8NH5I4UnmZr.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA06765_00-000000000TORTUGA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk0v3COZ0EA,20%,,"Strategy, Strategy, Simulation",239.2,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1516/gmXJznLBssugZ8NH5I4UnmZr.png,,Tortuga - A Pirate's Tale,TRD,Kalypso Media GMBH,2023-01-18,tortuga--a-pirates-tale-playstation-tr,,1,299,,239.2,1

,2023-04-12,"Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, in most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.",2023-03-28,/game/89898,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png?w=200,10,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-GASSTATIONSIM0EU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQQbqDBpm_0,25%,26,Simulation,139.3,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png,,Gas Station Simulator,TRD,MD GAMES SA,2022-10-19,gas-station-simulator-playstation-tr,,0,199,13,149.25,1

The Two Point Studios Double Pack features both critically acclaimed games - Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. Also includes Two Point Hospital's first four major DLCs, Bigfoot, Pebberley Reef, Close Encounters and Off the Grid, along with two item packs, Exhibition Items and Retro Items. Two Point Hospital Build, cure and improve! Build up a hospital from nothing to a masterpiece as you design the most beautiful – or functional – healthcare operation in the whole of Two Point County. Optimise your hospital design to increase patient (and cash) flow, arranging corridors, rooms and waiting areas to your exact specifications. Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible. Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in. Cure unusual illnesses! Don’t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, you’ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism – each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine. Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. Once you’ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut. Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next? Two Point Campus Build your university, your way! It’s time to spin academia on its head! Got a yearning for learning? Or just keen to build an educational masterpiece? Two Point Campus is jam-packed with new creative tools to help you build the university of your dreams. For the first time, build on the outside as you develop a blank canvas of greenery into your own delightfully educational campus environment, housing the top teaching facilities in the land. Lay down pathways with new easy-to-use tools. Plant glorious collections of outdoor flora. The only limit is your imagination (and your in-game bank balance). Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies. Build libraries, hire the best staff, kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked! But it’s not just work hard. Oh, no. It’s play hard, too. You’ll need to keep an eye on their happiness and make sure they’re getting enough entertainment, pastoral care and general joie de vivre to develop into incredible individuals who will do the legacy of your university proud.

Do you want to be remembered? You'll have to earn it. Your companions have captured the German bunker during the Battle of Normandy, and your task is to defend it at all costs. Defend your bunker! It won't be easy though. The command has prepared a lot of missions for you to perform including: - Cooking - Soldiers are humans and between fighting, they need to rest, get fed, and regain their energy. The enemy won't wait for you to get ready. The day is short. Many tasks await you. Prepare food to regain some strength. - Scavenging - The sky is full of enemy aircraft. It's hard to get enough supplies from your allies. You must scavage whatever you can to survive. Search the bodies of those killed in battle - sometimes you will even find chocolate! Remember to check the supply regularly as you must also take care of your companions. Order wisely and share food. - Encrypting - If you don't have enough bandages, food, or ammunition, send a message to the command with a request for a supply drop. It is mandatory to enter the password in the Morse code. Receive encrypted messages and anticipate your enemy's plans. - Shooting, killing, and destroying - This is why you are here. Perform missions - be vigilant and make good use of your machine gun, anti-aircraft gun, and anti-tank cannon. - Survive or Die - Take as many enemies with you as you can.

The goal is simple - enter the maze and gun down anything that stands between you and the exit. Your objective may always be the same but everything else is endlessly changing. Each maze is a procedurally generated level where the enemies, items, and the maze’s layout itself is random. Not a single corner you turn will be the same as the last time you entered. Progressively tougher alien foes will try to take you out once you enter their proximity so you better be ready to shoot first and ask questions later. Modifiers scattered around each maze will augment your abilities and shots. Each pick-up presents a unique choice that’ll define your play style. Simplicity is at the heart of Maze Blaze. It’s easy to jump into yet has enough depth to keep you playing. You can kick back in a long gaming session or just clear a couple of mazes when you’ve got a bit of downtime. No matter how you choose to play, you’ll always make progress. The more mazes you blast through, the more stuff you unlock. Mix and match your newly acquired powers and weapons to dive even further into the different game modes.

,2023-04-12,"Buy this bundle to get Sam & Max Save the World and Sam & Max: Beyond Time and Space for a discounted price. Sam is a six-foot canine detective with a nose for justice. Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they’re the Freelance Police—an irreverent comedy duo whose esoteric crime-fighting style has been entertaining comic book and video game fans for more than thirty years. In 2006–2010, Sam & Max starred in a series of episodic adventures created by Telltale Games. Now you can play their first two seasons (eleven episodes altogether!) in these remastered versions, which have been lovingly updated with gorgeous HD graphics, overhauled lighting and lip-sync, finessed cinematography, remastered audio, and several all-new musical tracks featuring live jazz musicians. SAM & MAX SAVE THE WORLD It's just another day at the office for the self-proclaimed Freelance Police when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam & Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the spinny thing they do with their eyes.) Who's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds. SAM & MAX: BEYOND TIME AND SPACE The Freelance Police are back on the crime beat in a showdown with Santa Claus, a race to subdue a giant volcano, and a face-off with a Eurotrash vampire. And then things get even weirder. Is paranoid shopkeeper Bosco on to something with his talk of a grand conspiracy? Is diner proprietress Stinky hiding the truth about what happened to her grandfather (also named Stinky)? Will flaky neighbor Sybil Pandemik ever find true love? Did someone say… BIRTHDAY?! Zombies will dance. Mariachis will sing. A giant battle robot will trash the streets. And when their friends’ lives are on the line, Sam & Max will risk their very souls to set things right.",2023-03-28,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/1119/K4Uxs9Mz7maM8kZ0GzM7s466.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5966-CUSA30837_00-4668247043601821,,30%,,Adventure,209.3,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/1119/K4Uxs9Mz7maM8kZ0GzM7s466.png,,Sam & Max Save the World + Beyond Time and Space Bundle,TRD,SKUNKAPE GAMES,2022-09-29,sam--max-save-the-world--beyond-time-and-space-bundle-playstation-tr,,0,299,,209.3,1

Meet six other eligible kaiju and visit twenty-four famous landmarks where Gigachu will answer challenging compatibility questions to decide the fate of your relationship. LANGUAGE OF LOVE Don't worry if you're new to romance or don't speak any love languages because kaiju are notoriously non-verbal.

Take part in the research expedition and be one of the first people to get inside the S.W.A.N. Institute since the reactor failure. You'll discover the place kept secret by ZSRR authorities, omitted during the evacuation after the Chernobyl disaster. Experience things that go far beyond the limit of human imagination. Face the danger locked behind the facility door. Find another expedition participant and discover the inhumane secrets of professor Kaydanovskiy - the founder of the facility. On the 26th of April 1986, a disastrous catastrophe had taken place. Reactor unit 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had broken down, which led to the explosion, and radioactive contamination of the vast area. At the beginning of February 1987 - 9 months after the disaster - a team of scientists from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology received signals that proved the existence of people operating in a previously evacuated area. Also, various, unexplained anomalies had been discovered. It turned out that signals came from the S.W.A.N Institute located near the city of Prypiat.

,2023-04-26,"Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is a standalone release of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed Dragonfall campaign, which first premiered as a major expansion for Shadowrun Returns. The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game making it the definitive version on consoles of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience. Man Meets Magic & Machine In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return… Key Features A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters. A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into. Command Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in. Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems.

,2023-04-12,"A visual novel about an abusive relationship, idealization, and intimacy. Live a summer of dysfunctional love through branching storylines, twists, sudden changes, and a special mechanic where you choose which senses to use with your boyfriend. In these moments, you will learn about him, his personality, and his past, making you question everything. Milky Way Prince is a semi-autobiographical story entirely designed, programmed, illustrated, and scored by a young author, Lorenzo Redaelli. During my experience with a borderline partner, I thought that falling in love with him was like becoming part of a binary star system. It’s the rarest, most precious thing in the universe – but the closer they get the more unstable they become. My idea was to create an immersive experience where the player is asked to try to understand the dynamics of this unusual relationship. The character you interact with adapts their behavior to yours – using academic terminology, they could set up “rage tests”, “love bombing, or otherwise guilt trip you. The plot's branching storyline is guided by variables such as “submission” and interest” that fluctuate at each interaction.",2023-03-28,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/3109/LkJfZKSVEhP8H7WVTwUzyOAx.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4977-PPSA06752_00-1147686809756156,,50%,,Adventure,57.6,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/3109/LkJfZKSVEhP8H7WVTwUzyOAx.png,,Milky Way Prince – The Vampire Star,TRD,FANTASTICO STUDIO SRL,2022-06-20,milky-way-prince--the-vampire-star-playstation-tr,,1,144,,72,1

,2023-04-12,"It is the year 2155, and life on earth has become unsustainable: the environmental situation is in a terrible condition. For the sake of survival, humans are forced to transfer their souls into a robotic body developed by the large neuro-technological company ION. After an unexpected accident, the protagonist L-064N awakes in one of the robotic bodies remembering nothing, but with the only information of being rescued by ION in a pitiful condition. Now his mind and soul are in an android body without the ability to communicate, but with technological functions far superior to those of his human body. System of Souls is a first-person puzzle-platformer. Throughout a series of tests, L-064N will discover with Aura, an overdeveloped AI, the neurotechnology facilities of ION and the events that have led him to his current path. The story seems to be based on a simple explanation, but the player will gradually discover the feelings and experiences of other robotic beings like him which will lead to a path of doubts regarding the truth you have been told L-064N will acquire and improve different skills as he progresses through the retrieval modules which explore different aspects of memory such as ideas, personality, or feelings. These retrieval modules will allow L-064N to explore and successfully solve the different tests simulated and implemented in his psyche by Aura. By solving these tests, the neuronal network of our protagonist will be stimulated, thus facilitating the reconstruction of his memory with the help of Aura. Explore and discover the story of L-064N, learn about the immense wisdom of Aura through the tests, discover characters with their unique stories, struggle to overcome ION’s challenges to regain your memory, and find clues that will help you understand the enigmatic world of System of Souls while solving mind-bending puzzles!",2023-03-28,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202212/1517/sPQQKdgWYe0hIQDWU9kpQf97.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0811-CUSA27727_00-7220096712407240,,55%,,"Action, Puzzle",57.6,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202212/1517/sPQQKdgWYe0hIQDWU9kpQf97.png,,System of Souls,TRD,GAMMERA NEST SL,2022-06-16,system-of-souls-playstation-tr,,0,144,,64.8,1

Having three arms lets you deal with more enemies at once and makes for a persuasive argument in any scuffle. Use your third arm to perform targeted attacks and throws, manipulate the environment, destroy obstacles, and wreck enemies. Hunt criminals across the fringes of the galaxy, the core worlds, and the ruins of long-gone civilizations. Upgrade your equipment, gain new abilities, grow stronger and destroy anything that stands in your way. Enjoy a complex story interwoven with high-octane gameplay and full of twists and turns that hit as hard as a bounty hunter's third arm!",2023-03-28,/game/94915,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/0812/77g4fOmjnPH20YfAbNg3zioe.png?w=200,6,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1302-CUSA32037_00-6696282731858849,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjk2JYlYjuI,25%,6,"Adventure, Action",113.74,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/0812/77g4fOmjnPH20YfAbNg3zioe.png,,They Always Run,TRD,Plug In Digital,2022-06-07,they-always-run-playstation-tr,,0,162.5,6,121.87,1

Experience the rush of parkour Navigate city rooftops like a parkour pro. Grab ledges, jump from roof to roof, vault through windows, slide down cables, swing from hooks: your possibilities are limited only by your attentiveness, creativity, and reactive skill. Designed for virtual reality, you’ll feel the rush of leaping across impossibly wide gaps over dizzying heights. Don’t look down! Fight for your life at 1,000ft Once you’re a parkour pro, it’s time to turn up the heat. Turn on enemies, and the city will be crawling with snipers who want you dead. To survive, you’ll need to combine fast-paced parkour moves with strategic dodges as bullets fly your way. You’re not defenseless - equip your own weapon and experience the satisfaction of picking off a sniper mid-air, nailing your landing on the edge of a skyscraper, then flowing straight into a wall-run to line up your next target! Of course, if the enemies are too much to handle, you can always disable them and focus on pure parkour. ARCADE MODES Endless mode Infinite level generation provides unlimited challenging terrain. Build your score by landing jumps over impossibly wide gaps, nailing insane wall-runs, sliding under barriers, and swinging between buildings. There’s no turning back or time to stop - as the world quickly falls apart behind you. Oh, and did we mention the rooftops are crawling with snipers? Pull out your 9mm mid-air and pick them off as you glide across the gap between buildings. Time Run Mode Compete for the top spot on the leaderboard. In Time Run mode, it’s all about speed. As the terrain unveils itself ahead of you, you’ll need to visualize your route on the fly, and execute each move with precision. Arena Mode In Arena mode, you’re presented with a spacious section of the city’s rooftops, without the pressure of a creeping barrier coming up behind you.

,2023-04-12,"Set long after humanity has polluted this planet, groundwater is undrinkable and seeing a living plant is considered a luxury. Most people live in megacities that rely on the labor of poor masses to sustain a modern standard of living for the few at the top. With the Earth scorched, water is liquid gold, and control of it is the truest form of power. Forced to cope with a permanent water shortage, ordinary people persist and toil in the hope that if they work hard enough, they too can someday swim every morning in the refreshing pools of the Gardens. We follow the story of Josephine Lace, a young hydraulic engineer eager to climb the corporate ladder and claim a spot at the top. Until the day when that promising future is ripped away from her, leaving her half-dead and homeless, she becomes hellbent on taking down the system that ruined her and left her without a heart. Along the way she meets a diverse group of people sympathetic to her cause, every one with secrets of their own. With their help, perhaps she will find redemption, love, and most of all - vengeance.

The legendary mercenary Wolfhound has stopped contacting his customers a long time ago. Of course, many thought that the Valley had ruined him, but in fact it was a man who tried to do so. Which is not surprising, considering how many enemies a hired killer can have. One night, when Wolfhound arrived at a routine meeting with his client, the mercenary was ambushed. The abandoned plant, where the meeting was supposed to take place, was turned into a pile of rubble and dust, but the vigilantes could not find Wolfhound’s body in it. They couldn’t find his car either. The mercenary’s enemies celebrated their victory and went on with their lives, forgetting about Wolfhound like a bad dream. But a few years later, one of the vigilantes fell into a familiar snare, and seconds later all that was left of his armored car was a flaming pile of metal. One by one, those who had once tried to destroy the mercenary began to die under similar circumstances, and all of them met the same unfortunate end. Wolfhound has returned, but he stopped killing for money. Now all those who had once used his services started to die. The rumors about the emergence of a terrifying ghost named Barghest started to spread around the Valley. People just couldn’t believe that the mercenary could have survived that attempt on his life, and decided that he had really become a ghost. A far more dangerous and terrifying ghost than Wolfhound himself had been. The unique armoured car presented in the pack is known for its balance of weapons, combination of modules and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the “Packs” tab, select the desired armoured car and click the “Assemble” button.

Nothing strikes fear into your enemies more than a well-crafted piece of Samurai armor, and with 7 pieces to choose from, there's plenty of options. The additional 2 new weapons, and tactical are just the icing on the cake. That’s not all, the 3 new weapon skins are just as important for your enemies as they are you, at least they’ll know they’ve been slain by the best looking weapons out there. Let them keep some dignity...

The Feud vest allows for great flexibility and doesn't hinder your movement. A good choice when speed and efficiency are important. • Feud Armor, medium torso protection The main piece in the Feud line. It offers full upper body protection without slowing you down. If you want a true Cyber Warrior experience, this is for you. • Feud Banner, advanced torso protection What could possibly make the Feud Armor better?

Whilst not offering the latest in tech and features, it still provides solid protection against having your head bashed in. • Feud Mask, medium head protection The mark piece for the Cyber Warrior kit. You don't need to fake a smile with this on. It does a decent job of protecting your face while also boosting several aspects of the wearer. • Feud Helmet, advanced head protection The full headpiece for the Cyber Warrior kit. If you want to put fear in your enemies, this is the answer. Thanks to very light material, it allows for great manoeuvrability despite its large size. • Feud Trousers, medium leg protection A set of fairly neutral trousers that goes with the Cyber Warrior Feud set.

This leads you straight into the middle of an exciting murder case and a murder mystery unfolds while you listen to the testimonies of witness, friends and relatives. The whole game is somewhat Christmas flavored - however, don't get yourself comfortable, the game not going to give you a nice and warm feeling but rather confront you with a cold and harsh reality as the thrilling storytelling of the game will leave you with a cold shiver down your spine. The game is a must have for any true fan of thrillers and anyone how enjoys a murder mystery that goes beyond the normal story telling. How does the gameplay work? You will play as a free-floating ghost like creature. Basically, as the soul of someone who is experiencing the story. You are very small in comparison to the surroundings and can fly freely through the area. You start by exploring the area and enjoying the feeling of flying as well as the gentle yet mysterious background music. Soon after starting to explore, you will find the first memory piece. You can collect the memory pieces to continue with the story and to advance with the overall narration. The story talks about a young boy, about his live and about how everything changes. It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. The first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become.

,2023-04-12,"Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again is a dynamic platformer with the elements of a rogue-lite, a combo system and special moves. The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won’t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King’s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter’s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King’s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose. • The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty. As you progress, you'll come across Easter eggs, things that’ll crack you up and allusions to other games coupled with self-mockery • Randomly generated locations of items, artifacts, traps, rooms in the building, enemies and bosses • 12 characters, all with different performance and equipment • Customized equipment which can be upgraded with rocks, runes and enchantments • Secret features and tricks (e.g. get a firesword by plunging your sword into the lava) • Jaw-dropping action with various moves, skills and spells!",2023-03-28,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/1314/p9Xoj3zDWsHsxVd3qyJsR5SE.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5506-CUSA29830_00-PLPA000000000000,,60%,,"Role Playing Games, Action",10.75,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/1314/p9Xoj3zDWsHsxVd3qyJsR5SE.png,,Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again,TRD,BIG WAY LLC,2021-10-26,princesslootpixelagain-playstation-tr,,0,43,,17.2,1

,2023-04-12,"MAINFRAME DEFENDERS - tactical retrofuturistic strategy game. A computer virus has infiltrated the Stargazer research complex. Most of the robotic units are controlled by the virus. Lead a squad of 4 prototypes on a mission to defend complex mainframe. You'll have to repel assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and do more on your way to the deepest parts of the complex. Work with item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and return fire. But don't rely on a single strategy too much - enemies might have a way to counter it. But above everything else: defend the Mainframe! • RETRO STYLE: Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack. • DIVERSE TACTICS: Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets, eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind. • BUILD YOUR SQUAD: Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in MAINFRAME DEFENDERS you have to combine different items with unique abilities, to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build! • UNIQUE ENEMIES: Enemy squad won't sit idle, though. Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you will lose. • PROCEDURAL LEVELS: Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk falling behind? • PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Victory or defeat, the game is not over yet!

Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls Mr. Riggs, can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You’re the only human there, after all.

SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game – including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™’s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings.

,2023-04-12,"The final chapter of the krieg trilogy is here: after four years of campaigning the battle-tested Wehrmacht will have to face its hardest challenges in Order of Battle: Endsieg. The Endsieg campaign includes 16 unique scenarios. The story begins right after the Battle of Kursk, where the game provides the option to import a core force from either the Panzerkrieg or Sandstorm campaign. The first five scenarios are based on the historical 1st Soviet offensive in the Donbass in summer 1943, up to the Leningrad–Novgorod strategic offensive in early 1944. A decisive defeat of the Red Army will eventually allow total victory over the Soviet Union, while failure to do so will turn the campaign away from the Eastern Front and into the Battle of Anzio in Italy. In the second part of the campaign the player's forces are transferred to the west, where the Allied invasion of Normandy has opened a new front. Initially you'll be forced on the defensive, and you'll be tasked to extract other German forces from the Falaise trap, defeat Allied airborne units in Market-Garden, and defend the city of Aachen and the Huertgenwald against heavy attacks. By reaching a decisive victory in the German Ardennes Offensive in December 1944 the tide of the war can finally be turned again, leading to a set of ultimate battles to destroy the Allied armies once and for all. Covering the final years of the war, Endsieg offers powerful weapons such as Tiger II heavy tanks, Jagdpanther tank destroyers and Me-262 jetfighters as well as several new specializations.

Order of Battle: WWII comes back to the Pacific Theatre, covering one of the cruellest but most underrated conflicts of the Second World War period. In Order of Battle: Morning Sun you take control over the Japanese forces fighting for territorial expansion and rich Chinese resources. The conflict soon turns into a massive all-out war between the two sides during the Battle of Shanghai. While the Chinese forces are numerically superior, they have suffered from internal conflict and are poorly equipped with outdated weapons. The recently modernised Japanese Army on the other hand is well trained and experienced, but as the war drags on it gets increasingly overstretched, allowing the enemy to regain the initiative at several occasions... Japanese armies have been reinforced with several new units including biplane fighters and bombers such as the Ki-10, D1A and A4N1, the S?k? Sagy? Ki flamethrower-equipped engineering vehicle and Type 89 medium tanks.

Then we make a little detour to the Crimean Front, which offers a somewhat different challenge due to its peculiar geographical features. In summer 1942 the Wehrmacht launches a new grand summer offensive which finally leads to the crucial battle of Stalingrad. This battle plays a major role in Red Steel, and the various developments related to it are featured in several scenarios from autumn 1942 to January 1943. In the last stage of the campaign, the Germans recover again with another victory at Kharkov. The final scenario gives the player a glimpse of the Kuban air battles, where Luftwaffe and VVS - the Soviet air force - clashed in intense air combat with massive numbers of aircraft involved over the Kuban region in the Caucasus. The campaign continues right after the end of the previous Soviet DLC, Red Star. Players will be able to import their core army saved in Red Star to play the new DLC with experienced units, and previously unlocked commanders and specializations. The two extra scenarios depict Operation Mars, another Soviet offensive to eliminate the Rzhev Salient, and Operation Iskra, with the goal of opening a permanent land corridor to the besieged city of Leningrad. Victory here puts the player back onto the main campaign path. FEATURES Red Steel has new 16 scenarios, with 14 of them in the main campaign path, and 2 more in case of a minor outcome at Stalingrad. New Soviet commanders have been added, and can be unlocked on top of those from Red Star by achieving certain objectives. A new set of specializations shows the impact of Lend-Lease aid. Other choices show the development of the Red Army when forming specific Shock Armies, and later Guards Armies.

,2023-04-12,"Red Storm, the third Soviet-themed DLC for Order of Battle, covers the battles of the Red Army between 1943 and 1945. The campaign begins with the fierce tank battle near Prokhorovka during Operation Citadel, the last grand German summer offensive on the Eastern Front in mid-1943. Following the failure of Citadel the Red Army will almost always be on the offensive. Like in the previous Soviet DLCs, Red Star and Red Steel, Red Storm includes both famous and crucial battles as well as operations that are less known or limited in scope, but still provide unique challenges. So while the Eastern Front is known mostly for large land battles, a few operations with amphibious and naval elements, like the Kerch-Eltigen landings and the liberation of Crimea, were added. An optional scenario roughly in the middle of the campaign depicts key aspects of partisan warfare in Byelorussia. Most core units cannot be used here, and the scenario can be skipped entirely if the player prefers more conventional battles. But winning it offers additional benefits in Operation Bagration, the huge offensive against Army Group Center in the same region a few months later. The ultimate goal of this campaign is of course the defeat of the Third Reich in the Battle of Berlin. But Red Storm does not stop there - players can opt for another battle after the fall of Berlin and take their core army to the Far East to defeat Japanese forces in the last major Soviet offensive of World War 2 in Manchuria.",2023-03-28,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/2613/V2wutwjrBvpyoqbBf4meJtOR.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4136-CUSA14680_00-OOBDLCE000000012,,61%,,Strategy,56.16,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/2613/V2wutwjrBvpyoqbBf4meJtOR.png,,Order of Battle: Red Storm,TRD,Slitherine,2021-08-19,order-of-battle-red-storm-playstation-tr,,0,144,,56.16,1
,2023-04-12,"The ultimate goal of Imperial Japan is to become the dominant power in the western Pacific. In December 1941, a carefully planned strategy is set in motion through a series of major offensives, including a carrier strike on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor. The shock of these surprise attacks is intended to cripple the Allied forces, giving the Japanese army and navy the time needed to establish total hegemony over their opponents. Rising Sun puts the player in command of the Imperial Navy - built around a powerful fleet of battleships and aircraft carriers, as well as the Imperial Army - hardened from years of war with the Chinese. Managing the limited resources available to build a well-balanced force of unique units such as the lethal A6M Zero fighter aircraft and the mighty Yamato battleship class will be the key to a successful outcome of the Japanese offensive. From the beginning of the campaign, starting with the air raid against Pearl Harbor, the initiative lays in the hands of Japan, but as Allied resistance stiffens, only a commander able to achieve decisive victories can keep up the momentum and fulfill Japan's imperial dreams. Including key historical battles, the what-if invasion of Australia and many unique Japanese weapon designs and prototypes, Rising Sun offers a unique experience set in the Pacific Theatre of WW2.

,2023-04-12,"In the spring of 1942 the Japanese suffer their first major setbacks of the Pacific War with the naval battles of Coral Sea and Midway. Seizing this opportunity to take back the initiative, US High Command launches an offensive operation against forward Japanese outposts in the Solomon Islands. As part of this expeditionary force, the US Marine Corps is tasked with assaulting the islands of Tulagi and Guadalcanal. A long and bloody campaign of island hopping in the Pacific Ocean has begun… Order of Battle: U.S. Marines puts players in control of the elite U.S. military branch which proved essential in the Allied victory over Japan.

,2023-04-12,"December 7, 1941 – the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor left America shocked and the US Navy stunned. Glorious battleships such as USS Arizona were sunk or put out of action for. This infamous raid gave Japan a serious advantage right from the start, but they have sorely underestimated the American determination to overcome this setback and fight back the aggression. Four long years of war now lay ahead to determine the outcome of this epic struggle... As the commanding officer of the US Pacific forces, the player is tasked to put a halt to the Japanese aggression and restore American supremacy in this part of the globe.

,2023-04-12,"On November 30th 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War 2, the Soviet Union declares war on the neutral nation of Finland. Under the pretext of seeking territorial changes to protect the city of Leningrad, the vast Red Army envisions a quick victory against the small and poorly equipped Finnish defence force. Outnumbered three to one and facing an enemy with an insurmountable superiority in tanks and aircraft, a great challenge lays ahead of the Finnish Army. But its brave and stubborn soldiers, fighting for their homes and families, every intent to welcome the enemy to a freezing hell of ice and fire.

,2023-04-12,"Order of Battle: World War II is a turn-based strategy game with an impressive variety of scenarios and theatres of war. Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders – split between Generals, Pilots and Captains – is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow.

,2023-04-12,"You find yourself in a room with no exits. Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive? If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode! Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play. You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type. The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it.

Cursed enough that somebody has to deal with it… That’s where The Darkside Detective comes in. Whenever you hear a bump in the night, feel a tingle up your spine, or smell something fishy, Detective Francis McQueen isn’t far behind. No, he doesn’t smell of fish - it’s a phrase, come on... Picking up after the events of The Darkside Detective, McQueen has to save his usually-present (in body, if not mind) sidekick Officer Dooley from the Darkside, so the two can get back to what they do best - investigating the city’s many strange, often paranormal, always paradoxical goings-on.

Parker was once a loyal Brotherhood fighter. But the Wasteland changed him beyond recognition. He rarely spoke, often disappeared somewhere, and in combat he got out of seemingly hopeless situations without a single scratch. Former friends and fellow soldiers began to fear him and gave him the nickname “Spyder”. As time passed, the Wasteland practically became home to Parker. The affairs of the Brotherhood no longer interested the former soldier. He seriously modified his armoured car and began to spend a lot of time among the Nomads. It seems as if there’s nothing left of old Parker. The unique armored cars presented in packs are known for their perfect balance of weapons, armour and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, after starting the game, open the blueprint menu (“B” key ), go to the “Packs” tab, select the desired armoured car and press the “Assemble” button.

You can upgrade any of the six upgradable items for your car: - Shield - makes your car last longer - Guns - the better your guns the more damage they do - Side Guns - triple your weapons reach by shooting out the sides of your car too - Magnet - increase the length of time the magnet power-up operates for - Nitro - increase the length of time the nitro power-up operates for - Laser - increase the length of time the laser power-up operates for Progression & Challenge The player can pick from one of three cars; the player begins with only one car unlocked. The second and third cars only become available after a series of challenges have been achieved relating to the level, total distance travelled and number of cars destroyed. Once the challenges have been achieved, the player can use their coins to buy the car. As the player progresses through the levels, the enemy cars become harder and harder to destroy. The player will need to keep upgrading their car to keep up!",2023-03-28,/game/105931,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1518/bBftgSlDNIhOqrjM1c1Ra9Nl.png?w=200,0,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4358-CUSA26686_00-ROADFURYEUR00000,,70%,29,Shooter,19,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1518/bBftgSlDNIhOqrjM1c1Ra9Nl.png,,Road Fury,TRD,FUNBOX MEDIA LIMITED,2021-03-31,road-fury-playstation-tr,,0,76,0,22.8,1

The appearance of a permanent Syndicate outpost in the Valley was only a matter of time. The “Dragons” habitually occupied several business centers, which soon shined with neon lights. And soon the Survivors heard rumours about the keeper of newly developed places — Munmu. Ruthless and rarely participating in any negotiations, he quickly demonstrated to local raiders that those who challenge the Syndicate do not live long. The unique armored cars presented in packs are known for their perfect balance of weapons, armour and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, after starting the game, open the blueprint menu (“B” key ), go to the “Packs” tab, select the desired armoured car and press the “Assemble” button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases up to 62. Buying the pack also gives early access to several faction-specific structural parts.

Being made of bricks and mortar doesn’t mean you don’t have your own things to worry about. This ragtag group of friends were there, right from the start, when it really became a city. With them they brought the titans of the industry, hundreds of jobs, and hundreds more houses. But the Linen Mill’s not been getting many textile orders come through this year, the Warehouse lost another contract from the neighbouring city and the Old Bank’s having money troubles. Something’s not quite right. Change is coming. What if they’re next? Fortunately, you, The Halfway Hotel, are at hand to step in and reassure everyone that things will be ok. But what starts off as small odd jobs ends up unravelling into more problems, as history moves faster than you can keep up with.

Countless heroes have tried and failed to destroy the ancient spell that holds the castle walls. Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside, guarding the sword shards — the last known thing to be capable of defeating the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure. Although you are not alone — some help could be obtained from the merchants, who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them to disappear... Plan your every step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option. There are two difficulty modes: PAL/NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch. Just like in old NES games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found… Features: - Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming. - Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock. - Randomly generated castle, 216 rooms to overcome. - Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming.",2023-03-28,/game/45825,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/0516/PR3tOOkXXc9G7Zs8zewJEI9o.png?w=200,4,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5645-CUSA26567_00-00ZOLOTAYACHASHA,,50%,6,Role-Playing,6.7,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/0516/PR3tOOkXXc9G7Zs8zewJEI9o.png,,Castle of no Escape 2,TRD,Xitilon,2021-03-13,castle-of-no-escape-2-playstation-tr,,0,67,0,33.5,1

Screen Languages: English, French *French language text will be added via a patch. This story takes place three years after the events of the previous game “Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout,” and depicts the reunion of Ryza and her friends, who go through new encounters and goodbyes to discover a true priceless treasure. ?The Story? Three years have passed since Ryza’s secret grand adventure on Kurken Island. Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life. ?Main Features? ? Exploring with new field actions! Ryza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively. ? More action-filled real-time battles! Take on your enemies using an improved “real-time tactics” battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever. Speedily switch between characters, choose varied skills, and utilize items in just the right moments for best results. ? Straightforward and easy-to-use synthesis! Utilize several new synthesis systems, including the new intuitive “Linkage Synthesis” system where items are placed in cells called “Material Loops”, that are designed to allow both new players to easily learn synthesis, and experienced players to create unique customized items.

,2023-04-12,"In the beginning there was nothing, only a chaos of dreams, out of which came Xary. It tried to understand people's nature and help them, but it’s too young for that. Then you came along. Together, you can get to the bottom of this… Sometimes life tests us. The main characters of these stories will face many challenges, whether it be the illness of someone you love, a perilous journey or walking away from an abusive relationship. The solution is not always obvious and often frightening. Immerse yourself in three moving stories filled with pain, joy, fear, hope and triumph. My Hidden Things is a bold experiment: it's a mixture of a visual novel and hidden object adventure with unusual mechanics. You have not only to search for objects but also combine them to get the ones on your list. The plot revolves around the dreams of several people you and Xary need to help. With your assistance, they can overcome their difficulties and stay human.

,2023-04-12,"This bundle includes the ‘Flying Soldiers’ game and five exclusive PlayStation® avatars. Download it free-of-charge if you already purchased ‘Flying Soldiers’. Get ready to command an odd squad of fun birds and devise a plan to bring them safe and sound to the end of the battlefield. An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers. Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these flying soldiers can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these characters, they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance. Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help. It's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.",2023-03-28,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/2017/xEklooqKV4sYz7liyfsMYa3b.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3877-CUSA20588_00-FLYINGAVATARBUND,,73%,,"Family, Puzzle, Unique",31.68,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/2017/xEklooqKV4sYz7liyfsMYa3b.png,,Flying Soldiers (Game + Avatar Pack),TRD,Wild Sphere S.L.,2020-12-09,flying-soldiers-game--avatar-pack-playstation-tr,,0,144,,38.88,1

Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene! Every corner of the game’s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games. Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next. For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored. From enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.",2023-03-28,/game/69306,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/2913/ezrLujSSqsrrPwQto1UeAWgl.png?w=200,4,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5911-CUSA20344_00-RAJIANANCIENTEPI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaSp7L0dSYI,66%,6,Adventure,81.26,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/2913/ezrLujSSqsrrPwQto1UeAWgl.png,,Raji: An Ancient Epic,TRD,SUPER DOT COM LTD,2020-10-15,raji-an-ancient-epic-playstation-tr,,0,239,5,81.26,1

Movement or firing uses up fuel, though levels can be replenished by shooting the fuel dumps. Running out of fuel means you loose control and can't fire. If all fuel dumps are destroyed on any given level the player's fuel tank capacity is doubled for the next level (this does not apply to starting from the highest level reached). Avoid obstacles or lift them out of the way with the tractor beam. Avoid the obstacles and enemy fire while navigating the terrain. Don't land too fast...make sure it's a soft landing. When all the humanoids are collected, fly high above the planet to escape, making sure you have enough fuel. Keep an eye on fuel levels and destroy fuel dumps to replenish. When all levels are complete, they repeat with a slightly higher difficulty setting. When a life is lost the player is temporarily shielded against enemy fire, this is represented by an electrical circular field around the lander just after it is respawned.

Getting both games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT’s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem. Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world. You can be truly free. SUPERHOT Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets. SUPERHOT’s features: Endless Mode : how long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies? Challenge Mode: take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more. Replay Editor: edit and upload your best runs for all to see on killterest.com. Extras: delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted]. Thirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and design. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and nominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by its independent, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the globe. SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT’s signature power fantasy. You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow-motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they’re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched. Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel. You take a moment to consider. You’ve been here before. So many times. Maybe this time it will actually mean something. MCD’s features The third game in the SUPERHOT franchise - MIND CONTROL DELETE gives you more insight into the world of SUPERHOT, more story, more signature gameplay. Keep dancing the slow motion ballet of destruction for so much longer than ever before. Much bigger than its predecessors. MCD immerses you in its world for days of increasingly explosive slow motion combat. More mechanics at your disposal than ever before. Experiment with different play styles, different character builds, different ways to outsmart and dominate your enemies. More power to accumulate as you progress through the game. Amass skills, hacks, special techniques to conquer waves of ever more dangerous enemies. More characters for you to control and for your enemies to throw at you. Test your arsenal of tricks and weapons against increasingly deadlier, smarter foes. More polish applied over nearly four years of Early Access development.

Rather than taking place in a dungeon, the game is set in a functioning, procedurally generated city, where complex AI informs denizens from all walks of life, who are just trying to get by in their daily activities. In order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through the use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.

,2023-04-26,"In this psychological survival adventure, the masked protagonist must escape from a city ravaged by disease, by any means necessary. Starving and exhausted, he has begun to question how much of what he sees is even real. Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut is a new kind of adventure where the choice of how to survive is up to you. Sneak through without firing a single shot, or kill everything in your path. Eat and sleep well, or resort to drugs to keep going. Search for survivors, or try to escape the city alone. Look after your mental health, or descend into madness. Lone Survivor is a game where your choices genuinely matter. This extended edition of Jasper Byrne's horror masterpiece expands Lone Survivor's deep story with hundreds of tiny new details, more locations, more dialogue, more side quests, more craftable items, and even two completely new endings. Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut really is the ultimate version of this acclaimed game.",2023-04-11,,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/EP4395/CUSA01049_00/uj30Jx8tMJwGbMjJsFHzFGc1VkEUUJ2H.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4395-CUSA01049_00-LONESURVIVORDCUT,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3a_AIC-w-Q,80%,,"Horror, Action, Adventure",7.1,https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/EP4395/CUSA01049_00/uj30Jx8tMJwGbMjJsFHzFGc1VkEUUJ2H.png,,Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut,TRD,Curve Digital,2014-10-14,lone-survivor-the-directors-cut-playstation-tr,,0,71,,14.2,1
