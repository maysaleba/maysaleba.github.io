Passive Co-Op Multiplayer As you adventure through Ashen, you'll occasionally encounter other players in a massive open world, akin to the passive multiplayer of Journey. It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore them. Souls with a Twist Ashen is faithful to the \"souls\" genre of stamina-based combat, introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world. But here\u2019s the twist - no two gameplay experiences are alike. Whether you\u2019re exploring bogs, investigating a fjord or pillaging an old palace, where you are at any given moment will dramatically alter the course of your adventure. It's a brutal open world; you're just living in it. Creatures + Combat Ashen has no shortage of dangerous encounters, from hostile enemies to indigenous creatures. You'll be rewarded for studying the environment and its inhabitants, planning your adventure rather than flying by the seat of your pants. The flora and fauna within the world aren't just fantastical; they're often fatal. Each confrontation, no matter how trivial, has potentially dire consequences. Crafting is Key As you discover survivors, you'll have the choice to invite them to your Town. But these aren't mere adventurers - they're potential collaborators, bringing a plethora of crafting skills, from blacksmithing to foraging expertise, in tow.

He's grown prudent, amicable, kind and caring, without any intention to cause major mayhem just to further his own selfish ends. It seems he is far from chaining himself to flaming saw blades, training torpedo-dolphins or foraging through platypus nests. Or is he? Ultimately it's a flaming saw blade grounding Goal on Deponia again. By accident, her consciousness gets split into three parts and stored to three different discs. Now it's on Rufus once again to convince all three parts of Goal, utilizing his remarkable charming wits, to become one again, venture to Elysium with her and save Deponia from certain doom while he's at it.

Sadja, a Southern princess, has an unstoppable desire to become the greatest hero in history \u2013 by joining and succeeding in the biggest war Aventuria has ever seen: The war of the Mages, fought in the middle of an uninhabitable desert. Bird catcher Geron lives almost 450 years after the Great War. Geron\u2019s eternal love, Nuri, has been turned into a crow by an evil curse. To give her back her human form, Geron needs the help of the mysterious merchant Fahi, who has magical powers.

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community. Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes\", which were originally published separately, available now on Nintendo Switch™ for the first time. Also for the first time, it has been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_KentuckyRouteZeroTvEdition_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0_n9QPves4","PeruPrice":"40","PercentOff":"40%","genre":"Adventure,Indie","ArgentinaPrice":"1199.99","AustraliaPrice":"33.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_KentuckyRouteZeroTvEdition.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"40000","SouthafricaPrice":"209.95","BrazilPrice":"59.99","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/55198/kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Annapurna Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2020-01-28","Slug":"kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"49.99","ChilePrice":"8000","Price":"24.99","MexicoPrice":"279.99","SalePrice":"14.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.51","SCORE":"55","SaleEnds":"2022-03-28","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-07","description":"With a brand new and exclusive Vertical \u201cTate\u201d Mode for Nintendo Switch™, SkyScrappers is a 1-4 player arcade-style, competitive platform-fighting game.

The farm has lots of animals that want to be cared for. Their food grows in the yard, and Abbie can draw water from the well. Children playfully learn what to feed to each animal. But don't worry if they aren't fed or given water for a few days - they can take care of themselves as well! The following places can be visited on the farm: The Pigsty: Home to a family of three pigs, happily romping in the mud, waiting to be stroked and given lots of food. The Stable: Abbie's beloved horse lives here, and is happy to receive any attention. The stable is also where the farmyard cat tries his luck at catching mice. Despite the presence of the horse and the cat, there are a lot of mice, which are difficult to catch. The Garden: This is where all the food grows for the animals on Abbie's farm - carrots, apples, cabbage, beets, corn, grass, strawberries and more. After the fruit and other crops have been harvested, it takes a little while until they grow back again. The scarecrow keeps thieving birds away from the crops.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"8.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"109","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.18","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-04","LowestPrice":"2.39","SaleStarted":"2022-03-25","description":"Get ready for true winter madness!

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8Vlv9L9VM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"81","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/110363/rogue-bit-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"19","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"29.99","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"6.49","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-07","LowestPrice":"4.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-17","description":"Rodents! - Mouse - Scout - Capybara - Knight - Porcupine - Barbarian - Beaver - Wizard - Rat - Necromancer - Weasel - Swashbuckler - Every rodent has unique skills which get stronger as you use them - Every rodent hero has a unique back story - Every rodent hero has a unique list of challenges that limit their power Progression! - Power progression mechanic based on reincarnation - Every time a hero is defeated, subsequent heroes will be given power bonuses - By overcoming challenges all future heroes have an even greater potential to be more powerful Quests! - Seven quest zones - Forest - Desert - Jungle - Snow - Jungle - Mountain - Grassland - Parallax scrolling environments - Interactive dialogues with different Quests available depending on your progress - Take place inside of a maze - Mini map - Fog of war - Dynamic lighting with day / night cycle Enemies! - 50+ Enemies, including bosses - Each enemy has unique stats based on their classification - Tanky (Bonus health) - Vicious (Bonus damage) - Speedster (Bonus move speed) - Hyper (Bonus attack speed) - Hardened (Bonus defense) - Accurate (Bonus attack accuracy) - Have different abilities - Charge - Runs towards the Hero and does damage on impact - Ranged Attack - Fires projectiles - Ranged Bomber - Lobs projectiles that do damage on impact - Change Sides - Change from left side of Hero to right side or vice versa - Protector - Takes less damage and blocks projectiles\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RodentWarriors_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rodent-warriors-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Adventure,Action,Fighting,Role-Playing","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7.50","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RodentWarriors.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"90","BrazilPrice":"24.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Rodent Warriors","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"JanduSoft","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-18","Slug":"rodent-warriors-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"20","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"110","SalePrice":"4.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-04","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-14","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia. Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds. Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay.

For example, the knight is thrilling the land, stunning all the enemies on the line, while the huntress is charging a bow with energy, simultaneously firing arrows at all the enemies.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Guards_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/guards-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7iwYPpylU","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Strategy","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7.5","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Guards.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"90","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/24208/guards-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Guards","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Drageus Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-21","Slug":"guards-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"19.9","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"40.81","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.51","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-03-31","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-24","description":"Gurgamoth is the perfect mix of party chaos and competitive strategy, ideal for sitting around on the couch with a couple of friends.

Eighties of the twentieth century. The golden age of 8-bit video games. We were leaving school, and we were going to spend our precious coins in the arcade machines. One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari's Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn't pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time. Meteoroids 3D doesn't want to be better than Asteroids; that's impossible. What we want is to make a tribute. And that's all we want. We have added some aspects, besides the famous UFO: a demon, and some enemy ships that launch rockets to destroy us. Main features are: Features.

The World Large, procedurally generated and interconnected lands range from plains, to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water.

Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items.

Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians.

On a late-night highway drive, a quiet train car in the early hours, a walk through a moonlight park, or the endless wait in a deserted airport, we listen to weird music amid the ambient announcements of delays and question our place in the universe. Inspired by long travel and the stream of consciousness it fosters, Glitchhikers asks you to look inward. Find the answers to your questions and question the answers you receive. Ruminate on life, the universe, our place and purpose in it. Voyage through a freeform narrative experience, converse with the endless inevitability, and explore the cosmic, hopeful world you find yourself in.
