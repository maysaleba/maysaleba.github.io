In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-14","LowestPrice":"/game/68258","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","MainStory":16,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA01302_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":34,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/deathloop","Title":"DEATHLOOP","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-14","Slug":"deathloop-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":59.99,"MainExtra":23,"SalePrice":19.79,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"88","SaleEnds":"2022-11-29","description":"We fused card games and roguelikes together to make the best single player deckbuilder we could.

Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You\u2019ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\u2019ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows? Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\u2019ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You\u2019ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it. Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you'll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-14","LowestPrice":"/game/51108","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1322/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png?w=200","MainStory":8,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3376-PPSA04697_00-4288127721514045","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-AJjWF58AY","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":15,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":19.24,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1322/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/visage","Title":"VISAGE","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"SadSquare Studio Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-11","Slug":"visage-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":34.99,"MainExtra":11,"SalePrice":19.24,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"80","SaleEnds":"2022-11-29","description":"Buy Lost in Random™ once and get both the PS4™ and the PS5™ version.

As you cover the board the music builds to a beautiful crescendo of your own design. The only way to discover Chime is to play it, but if you want a glimpse, consider what it might feel like to cross Tetris, a music sequencer and a hypnotic dream about your favourite pop song. Chime Sharp takes Chime's classic dynamic and updates it for 2017. The core rules are the same but the aesthetic is clean and modern and the game's soundtrack has been completely refreshed. With sixteen new levels, experimental modes, new-era connectivity and sharper ways to play, Chime's finally back -- and it wants to be your new favourite mixtape. 1 player 900MB minimum save size Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).

There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. STORY MODE The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episodes 1+2 were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - \u201cDO NOT GO GENTLE\u201d Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - \u201cLUMINACE FUGUE\u201d Mackenzie\u2019s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? EPISODE THREE - \"CROSSROADS ELEGY\" In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? EPISODE FOUR - \"FURY, THEN SILENCE\" A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. SURVIVAL MODE Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-14","LowestPrice":"/game/21471","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202109/2306/ChPARRL6cgDRc3GuWkLZOZIa.png?w=200","MainStory":20,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2982-CUSA08624_00-TLDRKFULLGAMEPS4","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmKtKlufjwo","PercentOff":"66%","Completionist":226,"genre":"Action, Adventure, Adventure","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202109/2306/ChPARRL6cgDRc3GuWkLZOZIa.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-long-dark","Title":"The Long Dark","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Hinterland Studio Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2017-08-01","Slug":"the-long-dark-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":34.99,"MainExtra":49,"SalePrice":11.89,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"75","SaleEnds":"2022-11-29","description":"In Killing Floor 2 players descend into continental Europe where the outbreak caused by Horzine Biotech\u2019s failed experiment has quickly spread and gained unstoppable momentum, essentially paralyzing the European Union\u2014 Just one month after the conclusion of the events in the original Killing Floor, the specimen clones are everywhere and civilization is in disarray communications have failed, governments have collapsed, and military forces have been systematically eradicated.

Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","SaleStarted":"2022-11-14","LowestPrice":"/game/87808","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA24159_00-MAKAIRE000000001","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F177-VTSGSM","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":22,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":14.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection","Title":"Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Capcom U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-01","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":6,"SalePrice":14.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2022-11-29","description":"Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions, based on the globally beloved anime series, is an action soccer game featuring the latest graphics and super plays anyone can enjoy.

Also includes Two Point Hospital's first four major DLCs, Bigfoot, Pebberley Reef, Close Encounters and Off the Grid, along with two item packs, Exhibition Items and Retro Items. Two Point Hospital Build, cure and improve! Build up a hospital from nothing to a masterpiece as you design the most beautiful \u2013 or functional \u2013 healthcare operation in the whole of Two Point County. Optimise your hospital design to increase patient (and cash) flow, arranging corridors, rooms and waiting areas to your exact specifications. Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible. Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in. Cure unusual illnesses! Don\u2019t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, you\u2019ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism \u2013 each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine. Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. Once you\u2019ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut. Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next? Two Point Campus Build your university, your way! It\u2019s time to spin academia on its head! Got a yearning for learning? Or just keen to build an educational masterpiece?

Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies. Build libraries, hire the best staff, kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked! But it\u2019s not just work hard. Oh, no.

Unexplored 2 creates a vast, rich fantasy world for you to discover. It has a cool twist on permadeath: your character may die, but the world might persist. The game is an ambitious, procedural action-RPG without grind, xp, or gold. Instead the story is all about your choices and their consequences as history unfolds. As the titular Wayfarer you take on the quest to destroy the Staff of Yendor, for which you\u2019ll have to traverse your world. Along the way you\u2019ll meet tribes, encounter magical creatures and explore ancient ruins to discover mythical weapons and historic items. The game is challenging and you will die often. You may make a wrong choice, take on one too many creatures, or forget to stock up on food before traveling a desert. Whatever the reason, when your character dies, they\u2019re gone. No autosaving or quickloading. However, you can choose to continue your adventures with a new character in the same world, a few years later. Your new character will witness the result of the choices your previous adventurer made. You can leave items in a safe spot, ready for your next Wayfarer to pick up and use. You can try to fulfill your quest to destroy the Staff of Yendor with consecutive Wayfarers in the same world. However, when you die during your final mission, your world ends. Permanently. So, make sure you are prepared well and know everything there is to know about the last and most dangerous part of your adventure. When you fail, that world vanishes. The only thing left to do is to generate a whole new world with its own history, and begin the quest anew. Key features Radical content generation: Ludomotion's radical approach to content generation creates many layers of unique content, every time a new world is generated. Generative storytelling: Though every Wayfarer's ultimate goal may be similar, every hero will have their own world, story, and encounters. Systemic depth: The game features many systems and you will discover something new every time you play, even after hundreds of hours of gameplay. Legacy system: Actions of your past heroes impact the fortunes of those that follow in their footsteps. Use legacy wisely to give your successive adventurers greater hopes of completing their quest. Permadeath in a persistent world: When your hero dies, they stay dead. But you can choose to return to the same world with a new Wayfarer, or begin a new adventure in a completely unexplored world. Unique presentation: Realised in a beautiful art style, beyond what is expected from a generative game. Stylish lighting sets the mood and adapts to the time of day and local weather conditions. Orchestral adaptive soundtrack: Your adventure is accompanied by an orchestral, original soundtrack which reacts to the action and decisions you make as a player.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-14","LowestPrice":"/game/68196","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0113/cTFL0blDcYS01XO1w9W85Naz.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5834-CUSA26879_00-0321319775900312","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ZSojM7ABI","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":18.74,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0113/cTFL0blDcYS01XO1w9W85Naz.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Unexplored 2: The Wayfarer's Legacy","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Big Sugar","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-14","Slug":"unexplored-2-the-wayfarers-legacy-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":24.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":19.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-29","description":"Join the new faction of Responders as they help the members of The Union trapped in The Pitt and unlock bonus in-game digital themed cosmetic and C.A.M.P. items.

Most people live in megacities that rely on the labor of poor masses to sustain a modern standard of living for the few at the top. With the Earth scorched, water is liquid gold, and control of it is the truest form of power. Forced to cope with a permanent water shortage, ordinary people persist and toil in the hope that if they work hard enough, they too can someday swim every morning in the refreshing pools of the Gardens. We follow the story of Josephine Lace, a young hydraulic engineer eager to climb the corporate ladder and claim a spot at the top. Until the day when that promising future is ripped away from her, leaving her half-dead and homeless, she becomes hellbent on taking down the system that ruined her and left her without a heart. Along the way she meets a diverse group of people sympathetic to her cause, every one with secrets of their own. With their help, perhaps she will find redemption, love, and most of all - vengeance.

Everything from the visuals to the audio to the gameplay was designed and tweaked and polished to create the most intense and satisfying twin-stick shooter experience possible. SYSTEM initializing... Multiple virus infections detected... Launching DEVASTATOR program... You are the Devastator! Your objective is to eradicate 15 types of viruses in 3 unique modes: Quadrants, Sectors, and Cycles. In Quadrants, the wave layout is constantly changing as you battle increasingly intense waves of random viruses for 5 minutes. In Sectors, there are 55 unique waves of viruses across 5 sectors. And in Cycles, you'll battle semi-randomized spawning viruses across 5 variations of 11 waves. Complete your objective as the Devastator and take back control of the System! In addition to the main game modes, wave layouts, and various enemy virus types providing gameplay variety, Devastator's moment-to-moment gameplay contains surprising depth and subtlety. From the way you balance speed vs. firepower to the utilization of resources to knowing when to pick up powerups, Devastator rewards both fast reflexes and good strategy. Devastator features vector-inspired visuals mixed with HDR colors, five customizable full-screen filters and mesmerizing particle effects, all while running at insanely high framerates on high-resolution monitors. With modern graphics hardware, the game runs with ease on current high-end gaming monitors (such as 360hz at 1080p, 240hz at 1440p, or 120hz at 4k), and it can theoretically run faster at higher resolutions when better monitors and higher-throughput video cables exist in the future. Devastator was designed and developed by Luke Schneider (aka the Radiangames guy). Luke has been a huge twin-stick shooter fan since the 1980s, and has been developing twin-stick shooters since 2005. With Devastator, Luke decided it was time to make his ultimate and final 2D arcade-style twin-stick shooter. Devastator features include: * Ultra-high resolution and ultra-high framerates support - 4k 120hz, 1440p 240hz, 1080p 360hz, etc. * 3 different game modes - Quadrants, Sectors and Cycles, each with their own unique pacing and feel * 15 unique virus types to battle against * 55 unique waves across 5 sectors * Powerful power-up drops * Ever-changing wave layouts * Ultra-satisfying twin-stick shooting gameplay - that rewards you for your mastery and variety of tactics * Beautiful HDR, particle-laden graphics - with 5 unique filters and tons of customization options * Heart-pounding soundtrack and intense retro-styled sounds that enhance your experience","SaleStarted":"2022-11-14","LowestPrice":"/game/12856","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/1710/1gqL4Ug4yGbYpWNldzG2WD1a.png?w=200","MainStory":1,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1249-PPSA03002_00-7506945076104177","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":4.89,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/1710/1gqL4Ug4yGbYpWNldzG2WD1a.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Devastator","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"2Awesome Studio SL","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-25","Slug":"devastator-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":6.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":5.59,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-29","description":"Aery - Calm Mind 2 is an interactive game experience that is designed to relax your mind and soul.

Set in a ruthless world where any form of dissent is mercilessly crushed, the story follows a man who has dared to challenge the existing order. Set out on a lifelong journey and become an individual able to carve out their own destiny... But remember that freedom never comes cheap. Life in the Great Arknian Empire is harsh and its hardest Lot is yours by the circumstance of birth. You are a commoner, holding no rights and no title. To seize your fate and become the rightful heir to the legacy of the Brante family you will have to come to grips with ossified tradition and prejudice. Embarking on a life-long journey from one's birth until true death, you will have to endure great upheavals, face adversity, and make many difficult choices. Every decision will affect not only the protagonist, his family, and loved ones, but may even topple the foundation of the Empire itself. Key features At the turn of time Every imperial citizen's life is predetermined by their estate. The deities known as the Twin Gods have bestowed this truth to the world, dividing mortals into Lots. The nobles lead and rule over others, while the clergy guides people on the one true path, and the lowborn suffer, toiling away for the glory of the Empire. You may accept your fate without question, but it is also in your power to change the cosmic order that governs all. Your choice is not an illusion Divided into chapters, the game keeps track of the player's deeds, the skills they acquired, as well as other overlapping circumstances that shape a unique plotline for each playthrough. Every decision has its consequences and you will be held accountable throughout the entire journey. To protect your family and loved ones, to impose the rule of the Emperor and make a fortune, or to try and change the world as you see fit... Make your choice, but beware of the follies of pride and ambition. Fight for your life One man is anything but omnipotent in this realm yet under your guidance, Sir Brante may become a person who can endure every trial fate throws at him and rewrite the very laws that govern his world! Develop and train your character, leveling up such traits as determination, sensitivity, and endurance. All of the hero's skills, starting with those acquired in infancy, will affect his personality, worldview, and relationships, ultimately unlocking new talents and possible storylines. Find your own path The first complete walkthrough can take you upwards of 15 hours! Numerous branching paths that affect the unfolding story will make every playthrough a unique experience: become a noble judge, learn the ways of the inquisition, plot a revolution as a member of a secret society, or embrace an entirely different purpose. Be brave and fate itself shall bend to your will! There and hereafter Resurrection system allows the character to keep his experience upon death, letting the player reevaluate past steps and make adjustments to their strategy going forward. Take control not only of your life but also your demise, then put everything at stake in this cycle of death and rebirth!","SaleStarted":"2022-11-14","LowestPrice":"/game/89353","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202201/2115/LcHtBrVEm4FvYAnsm3Ti2Ci4.png?w=200","MainStory":8,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4851-CUSA31130_00-5618859464081896","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLivgYDS7Yg","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":23,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":19.24,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202201/2115/LcHtBrVEm4FvYAnsm3Ti2Ci4.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"101XP LTD","ReleaseDate":"2022-02-10","Slug":"the-life-and-suffering-of-sir-brante-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":24.99,"MainExtra":15,"SalePrice":19.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-29","description":"Game Overview: The grandfather of brick-breaking games is back with some of the toughest challenges yet!

Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to. Scale Massive Beasts ------------------------------- Overcome impossible odds to climb atop and defeat the massive beasts that are bound to this land. Climb, Glide, Swim ------------------------------- You can climb on virtually anything you can get your hands on, from ruins and mountains to the massive beasts that inhabit the land. Ascend to the tops of mountains and then glide over the open world to reach previously inaccessible locations. Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don't stay in too long or your swim could become your last. Explore, Craft, and Survive ------------------------------- You'll arrive on a frozen island with only the clothes on your back -- it's up to you to survive. Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn't the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait. Make Your Path ------------------------------- Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course. Unravel the Mystery ------------------------------- Why won't the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to. A Beautifully Frigid World ------------------------------- Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog. The remnants of an ancient civilization lie before you, but don't let awe turn into carelessness -- snow storms can crop up at any moment and bury you in a blizzard. Luckily, you can leave footprints in the snow and follow your footsteps back if you are lost.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-14","LowestPrice":"/game/64731","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1880-PPSA02131_00-3768321134104813","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzDl2THyF4w","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":20,"genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":19.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"PRAEY FOR THE GODS","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"No Matter Studios LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-12-14","Slug":"praey-for-the-gods-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":12,"SalePrice":19.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-29","description":"The original space shooter warps to the modern era!

To capture a creature, Sheepo must find their unhatched egg, which happen to be highly guarded by that species \"queen\" (aka, a boss.) With each egg Sheepo collects, you then gain the ability to transform into that creature on contact, and explore the deeper reaches of the planets sprawling environment Sheepo is a metroidvania, but contains no standard combat. Instead, gameplay is based on platforming and exploration. With the collection of each creature, Sheepo is able to dig, fly, and teleport across an interconnected series of landscapes, uncovering hidden shrines, old ruins, and strange characters. Features: -Tight platforming with variety. Play as both Sheepo, and the variety of creatures you come in contact with. Gameplay remains fresh as you consistently learn the moves of each creature -Traverse a sprawling landscape with tons of hidden rooms and characters. Explore old mines, an abandoned mall, lush forests, the dingy sewer system, and much more. -75+ hidden feathers to collect (the planets currency), which can be spent at the last remaining shop in DeadMall. -Non-linear gameplay. Sheepo begins somewhat linearly, but the map quickly opens up to allow you to make your own route.

In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness. The game\u2019s cutscenes, quirky cast of characters, and the majestic Pacific Northwest vistas have been enhanced for an experience that delivers as much on its visual impact as its unnerving atmosphere.

Partly inspired by the unrealistically fast gunslingers, the dark gritty humour, and the greed driven anti-heroes of the spaghetti western classics. Wholly inspired by vinyl digging, graffiti spraying, rhyming, and the slow jazzy drum samples of hip hop culture and sound. Are you feeling unlucky? In Luckslinger, ride the west of bandits, steal their luck, and use it for your own good. The more luck you have, the more chance you have for bullet evasion, better loot at your feet, and staying alive. However, when you're \"down on your luck\" in your trusty bracelet, bridges collapse, rocks tumble, and outlaws might know where you're sleeping that night. In Luckslinger, we rely on the luck of the draw. Clovercreek and the crazy outlaws \u2013 The town of Clovercreek has been robbed blind. Six infamous criminals stole the town\u2019s precious luck charms and it\u2019s up to you to bring them back.

If you make errors your systems will overload and your AI will be forced to relieve pressure by triggering one of the various array of facial explosions and mechanical glitches. As you upgrade your social mechanics, you will have to learn to smile when something is happy and frown when something is sad. There is also the eye contact upgrade, as humans find it suspicious if you look unceasingly into their eyes with a wide smile as they tell you a tragic story. GAME FEATURES - Make your way through 10 different social scenarios such as job interviews, eulogies, doctor examinations, and romantic conversations. - Upgrade yourself with the latest in social technology. Learn to smile, raise an eyebrow, and awkwardly glance away from eye contact, just like in real life! - The most realistic gibberish system ever seen in gaming.

Includes the following DLC: \u2022 DLC16: Playable character Kunimitsu! In the past, Kunimitsu was one of the members of the Manji Clan. However, she was kicked out by Yoshimitsu, the head of the Manji Clan, since she repeatedly stole for her own benefit. Later on, she tried to steal the sword called \u201cYoshimitsu\u201d from Yoshimitsu for her grandfather, who was a swordsmith. In the end, she was unable to steal the sword, and her grandfather passed away. She lost all desire to steal the sword, and vanished from Yoshimitsu\u2019s sight. Later on, she married a shinobi, and was blessed with a daughter. As time went on, her daughter grew to be a better ninja than her parents. She took on the name Kunimitsu from her sick mother, and accepted contracts from various governments and large corporations to steal important items. One day, Kunimitsu got a call that her mother\u2019s condition had worsened. She rushed to see her bedridden mother and heard the story of the only thing that her mother could not obtain in the past. Kunimitsu was then determined to obtain the sword to cheer her mother up. \u2022 DLC17: New stage Vermilion Gates! A fantastical stage with a Japanese motif, filled to the brim with elements from the Land of the Rising Sun! A breakable balcony and big changes to the stage between evening and nighttime make every round different and dynamic! \u2022 DLC18: Playable character Lidia Sobieska! Lidia has shown a keen interest in karate from childhood, and also politics, after the loss of her father, himself a political leader. She appears adept at both, entering and winning her first karate world championship at 18, and getting elected to office in her first campaign at 21. After a while, the war initiated by the Mishima Zaibatsu began to greatly affect Poland. Responding to growing demand from the public for a new, stronger political leader and a staunch response, she stepped forward to become Prime Minister of Poland at the young age of 29. After her inauguration, she immediately reponded to the incident; however, the letter from Mishima Zaibatsu head Heihachi Mishima in return contained a thinly veiled threat of consequences. She was incensed at the response, and immediately decided to enter the King of Iron Fist Tournament to stand up to Heihachi. \u2022 DLC19: New stage Island Paradise! A spacious beachside stage that features both a poolside right out of a high-class resort and a beach with beautiful clear water!

You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.

Step into the shoes of Sir Albert Wickes and The Right Honourable Clarence Baxter, two 19th century explorers who have chosen to pilot the HMS Fearful on its maiden voyage to Mars. When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park. It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece. For the solo voyager, the ship's computer-controlled cat will keep you company. Without a second pair of hands, Albert will need an extra dose of dexterity to navigate the challenges of Victorian space flight. The mix of action and thoughtful puzzles make 39 Days to Mars perfect for playing in short sessions. The entire adventure fits comfortably into an evening, or a long tea break. The HMS Fearful is ready to embark for Mars! 1-2 players 380MB minimum save size DUALSHOCK®4 Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
