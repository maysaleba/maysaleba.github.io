[{"SCORE":"92","SaleEnds":"2022-10-13","description":"From PlayStation Studios and Bluepoint Games comes a remake of the PlayStation classic, Demon\u2019s Souls. Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who\u2019ve faced its trials and tribulations before, can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance. In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One. With the summoning of The Old One, a colorless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them, lost their minds \u2013 left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained. Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight, are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title \u201cSlayer of Demons\u201d and send The Old One back to its slumber.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-28","LowestPrice":"/game/2439","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1717/GemRaOZaCMhGxQ9dRhnQQyT5.png?w=200","MainStory":29,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA01342_00-DEMONSSOULS00000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TMs2E6cms4","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":75,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1717/GemRaOZaCMhGxQ9dRhnQQyT5.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/demons-souls","Title":"Demon's Souls","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-12","Slug":"demons-souls-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":69.99,"MainExtra":42,"SalePrice":34.99,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"91","SaleEnds":"1990-01-01","description":"Hunted and alone, a boy finds himself drawn into the center of a dark project.","SaleStarted":"1989-12-17","LowestPrice":"/game/21694","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP2054/CUSA05297_00/t1t9CjFWdE1pNbjoLQtjcDmfhGrVEwgC.png?w=200","MainStory":3,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2054-CUSA05297_00-INSIDE0000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op4G1--kb-g","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":4,"genre":"Action, Puzzle, Adventure","PlusPrice":4.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP2054/CUSA05297_00/t1t9CjFWdE1pNbjoLQtjcDmfhGrVEwgC.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/inside","Title":"INSIDE","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Playdead ApS","ReleaseDate":"2016-08-23","Slug":"inside-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"MainExtra":4,"SalePrice":4.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"90","SaleEnds":"2022-10-13","description":"Welcome to a new world!

You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before! NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them! EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...) There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor. KEY FEATURES - A thrilling, rich storyline with a classic film-noir twist - Professional voiceover with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! - A carefully crafted, \"\"colorful\"\" world - A complex interrogation system - More than 30 unique, fully voiced characters - A cinematic film-noir-like experience with more than 20 cutscenes! - Lots of clues, information, and collectibles to find - A beautiful original soundtrack If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

You're in charge of a team of young rebels, the Gamers, fighting against the new anti-leisure laws oppressing the city. Equipped with high-tech gears allowing amazing jumps and speed, they roam the city to sabotage the propaganda, help citizens, and find a way to reach the Orbital Station. This way they could warn the Galactic Union and put an end to the oppression.
