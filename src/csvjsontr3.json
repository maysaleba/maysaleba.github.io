[{"SCORE":"88","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game. What Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of strange tales about a family in Washington state. As Edith, you\u2019ll explore the colossal Finch house, searching for stories as she explores her family history and tries to figure out why she's the last one in her family left alive. Each story you find lets you experience the life of a new family member on the day of their death, with stories ranging from the distant past to the present day. The gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the Finches themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death. Ultimately, it's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us. Created by Giant Sparrow, the team behind the first-person painting game The Unfinished Swan.

Take control of a team of deadly specialists and sneak in the shadows between dozens of enemies. Choose your approach when infiltrating mighty castles, snowy mountain monasteries or hidden forest camps. Set traps, poison your opponents or completely avoid enemy contact. The group is composed of very different personalities. Working together as a team seems impossible at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons. The player has to carefully evaluate his options in order to master the challenging missions: how will the characters behave as a team? Which one is best equipped for each task? How can they best master the given missions? Come up with your own ingenious tactics to vanquish enemies and complete missions.","SaleStarted":"1989-12-17","LowestPrice":"/game/38300","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/EP8923/CUSA07792_00/eFciErp6z1pkUAMnOI0RojfgTHVfoP67.png?w=200","MainStory":24,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8923-CUSA07792_00-DEAST00000000001","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1IfivSZIfY","PercentOff":"90%","Completionist":54,"genre":"Action, Action","PlusPrice":34.9,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/EP8923/CUSA07792_00/eFciErp6z1pkUAMnOI0RojfgTHVfoP67.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun","Title":"Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Daedalic Entertainment GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2017-07-30","Slug":"shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun-ps4-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/4AVF9DaV7W","IsPS5":0,"Price":349,"MainExtra":30,"SalePrice":34.9,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"84","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"Thumper is rhythm violence: classic rhythm-action, blistering speed, and brutal physicality.

Hop aboard an airborne hospital and meet its fully-voiced cast of eclectic characters. As time passes for everyone on board, explore the interwoven lives of the patients and staff; discover something new on each and every playthrough. Welcome to the Hospital It's the summer of 1978, and Casey Beaumaris is trying to make the most of her holidays, when her mum asks her to spend a long weekend helping out at the airborne hospital where she works. Casey prefers the company of books to people, but she agrees, secretly planning to write an article about her visit for the school newspaper. With her trusty notebook at the ready, Casey arrives on board the airship. The staff are overworked as they prepare for the visit of an important official, while the patients react to grief, or deal with active trauma. In the midst of these and many other interlocking and overlapping stories, Casey spends time with the patients, learning about their lives, and, as the stories unfold, discovering what she can do to help. Explore A Living World Within the world of Wayward Strand, time passes for everyone - characters continue their lives without waiting for you to interact with them. In Wayward Strand\u2019s unique narrative structure, the stories of over a dozen characters constantly unfold around you in real time, as you, as Casey, roam freely throughout each day. Choose which story to be a part of by following people, having conversations, and exploring the hospital. The hospital\u2019s residents are an eclectic cast of characters \u2013 some charming, some eccentric, some rude \u2013 each with their own desires, goals and imaginations. Every character moves and acts of their own accord, at their own pace, on their own timeline - sharing news with each other, arguing, joking, gossiping - or having a chat with Casey when she comes by. Every playthrough gives you the opportunity to discover something you didn\u2019t see previously - what you missed the first time, you might see the second, third, or fifth time around. Your Journey When you see someone, you can follow them, to see where they go and what they get up to. You can eavesdrop on peoples\u2019 conversations, or come into the room and be a part of the discussion. Spending time with particular characters will lead you to new storylines, locations, revelations and resolutions. As the journalist for her school newspaper, Casey keeps track of events and information in her notebook. Players use Casey\u2019s notebook to delve deeper into peoples\u2019 stories, to make new discoveries, and to piece together mysteries.

The story takes place in the land of Rin during the height of the Age of Sail, following the events that would lead to the greatest war in human history. STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin. POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history. CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle. PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total. This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"/game/103890","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png?w=200","MainStory":30,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3919-CUSA28518_00-R3PEU00000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8e4bk3jh0U","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":33,"genre":"Adventure, Role Playing Games","PlusPrice":122.85,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/rise-of-the-third-power","Title":"Rise of the Third Power","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2022-02-09","Slug":"rise-of-the-third-power-ps4-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5zwtGM82TJ","IsPS5":0,"Price":189,"MainExtra":32,"SalePrice":122.85,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"79","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"I Am Dead is a charming puzzle adventure game from the creators of Hohokum and Wilmot\u2019s Warehouse about exploring the afterlife.

In the turmoil-ridden Citte della Ombre, nothing holds sway except the Mascherines - masks that grant their wielders the power to channel the elements and cast destructive magic. The Mascherines have perpetuated a culture of inequality between the power-hungry guildsmen known as the Masquerada and the impoverished lower classes, the Contadani. One of Ombre\u2019s finest sleuths, Cicero Gavar, was exiled for a crime against the state five years ago, but he is now summoned back to Ombre to solve the mysterious kidnapping of the diplomat Razitof Azrus. As other members of the Masquerada join his investigation, all having their doubts about one another within this culture of deception, their faith will be pushed to the limit as a deeper conspiracy lurks in the shadows of Ombre. 1 player 12GB minimum save size HD Video Output 720p,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Chime Sharp is an sequel to 2009's Chime, a music puzzle game with an addictive, ambient heartbeat. You tessellate shapes to cover a grid, while a beatline reads those shapes as notes. As you cover the board the music builds to a beautiful crescendo of your own design. The only way to discover Chime is to play it, but if you want a glimpse, consider what it might feel like to cross Tetris, a music sequencer and a hypnotic dream about your favourite pop song. Chime Sharp takes Chime's classic dynamic and updates it for 2017. The core rules are the same but the aesthetic is clean and modern and the game's soundtrack has been completely refreshed. With sixteen new levels, experimental modes, new-era connectivity and sharper ways to play, Chime's finally back -- and it wants to be your new favourite mixtape.

Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as \u2018Shard\u2019 spreads throughout the underworld. With the city\u2019s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city\u2019s fate.

Nobody needs to die\u2026 unless you decide they must. Key Features: Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it\u2019s sneaking through levels or attacking head-on Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle A reactive story where the player\u2019s choices have real consequences Stylized pixel art environments and characters Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley Gameplay: Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them.

Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld.

The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America\u2019s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"/game/70302","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0311/EcTm14LTNjRgt0qM2gHT4502.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2520-CUSA23292_00-2988533598676746","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7tNpIu4wnc","PercentOff":"66%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":52.02,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0311/EcTm14LTNjRgt0qM2gHT4502.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/disjunction","Title":"Disjunction","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-27","Slug":"disjunction-ps4-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/8A1Ns30cqt","IsPS5":0,"Price":153,"MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":52.02,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"70","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"Coffee Talk is a game about listening to people\u2019s problems and helping them by serving up a warm drink out of the ingredients you have in stock.

They\u2019re not exactly what you and I would call \u201chuman friendly\u201d. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You\u2019re the perfect candidate for our test chambers! That being said, welcome and good luck! Can be played standing or sitting.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/EP1141/CUSA11216_00/CrqXJPZnQmnOS89ognA0bEq0AoRgzvfM.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1141-CUSA11216_00-CHROMAGUNPSVR000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Puzzle, Puzzle","PlusPrice":85.05,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/EP1141/CUSA11216_00/CrqXJPZnQmnOS89ognA0bEq0AoRgzvfM.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/chromagun-vr","Title":"ChromaGun VR","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Pixel Maniacs","ReleaseDate":"2019-02-18","Slug":"chromagun-vr-ps4-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/3Kw88qyg88","IsPS5":0,"Price":189,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":94.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"64","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"Restore Glory To Your Empire.

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike. There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series. This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians. Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields. It\u2019s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive \u2013 lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Just make sure you don\u2019t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies! The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front), with a new game Isonzo coming soon with mountain warfare on the Italian Front! These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines.

The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man\u2019s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn\u2019t for the faint hearted! Looking for more WW1 action?

Outsmart, outmaneuver, overpower, outclass your opponents in lightning-fast, adrenaline-inducing single-player space combat. You play as Leon Barret, ace fighter pilot of the Poseidon Security Forces. Here at Poseidon Corp., we are trying to pave the way for the colonization of Mars, as mankind is struggling for survival, split between a depleted hot Earth and a cold, claustrophobic Lunar colony. Your job is to maintain order by eradicating rebels and space pirates, facilitate our scientists' research while keeping them safe, and protect all our personnel from the numerous external threats. Dive down into gigantic asteroid mining plants, shoot down Rebel drones and fighters, roll left and right avoiding enemy fire, unleash impossibly powerful missile volleys, but also race against stray pilots and space scavengers at breakneck speed for the sheer thrill of it. By completing missions you will unlock Cards and Tokens to upgrade your fighter's Hull, Shields, Energy Weapons and Missiles until you are able to go up against massive Capital Ships and single-handedly shift the tide of the war. In an interplanetary struggle where nobody is good or bad, you will experience Leon rising through the ranks, the meaning of \u201cnecessary evil\u201d, the cost of integrity and ultimately, what it means to take a stand.

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. The game centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It\u2019s a shockingly enjoyable sci-fi action running game where the player uses techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts. As well as these evasive elements there\u2019s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action bundle and with it re-invents the running game genre.

If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"Contraptions\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style. Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels. Features + Solve over 200 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds. + Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it. + Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs. + Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like. Gameplay On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. When the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again. Gadgets Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car. Objectives There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc. The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1611/903ac3051a1c8b056dfb990b0e323721f39ab8674bbbc7c9.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4358-CUSA40925_00-CONTRAPTIONS2EUR","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Puzzle","PlusPrice":17.25,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1611/903ac3051a1c8b056dfb990b0e323721f39ab8674bbbc7c9.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Contraptions 2","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FUNBOX MEDIA LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2023-04-05","Slug":"contraptions-2-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":69,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":20.7,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"Play as Marfusha, a gate guard in a dystopian world depicted in 2.5D pixel art, and protect the city gates from being destroyed by invading enemies.

Is it a plane? It's falling too fast to be either of those. It's McPixel! A wanna-be hero who keeps getting mixed up in the most unbelievable situations you can imagine. Levels One moment you're stuck in a speeding train headed towards the cliff; the other, you're in a falling plane. Sometimes you need to win an impossible-to-win soccer match, and the other, you're a dinosaur trying to hide from a meteorite. Stuck in a flaming house? Sandwiched between two battling armies? Certainly not a problem for McPixel! 100 levels of fast-paced action are waiting for you! Minigames Sometimes, the usual adventure style will get interrupted by genre-bending minigames. Ranging from racing, shooting, fighting, and sports to even platforming or FPS! The game offers over 20 minigames scattered around the world of McPixel! Coins and stamps McPixel is not all about just saving the day but having fun trying to come up with the craziest possible solutions. And for every solution, you will be rewarded with coins! Find all solutions in a level to get the gold prize and some extra coins! You can use them to unlock new levels! Also, everyone loves coins, right? They're shiny and golden and spinning! No reason not to have some more! McBurg The game takes place in the city of McBurg. Explore the city and find different adventures! Some of the paths in the city are blocked and will require you to spend coins to move forward and access new levels! The city will get populated with characters and items from the levels you already visited as you play. You will also be able to don some of the costumes you found while playing. On the edge of the city upon a grassy hill, you can see a Devolver vault, full of gold, looming over McBurg. So, if you ever need a lot of coins, maybe it's time to pay Fork Parker a visit? Steve Sometimes, during your adventures, you will find Steve. Steve can be in the weirdest and most unexpected of places, and finding him will transport you to the Steve level. Steve is not like McPixel and doesn't specialize in saving the day. He's just some guy, doing stuff. Like fishing, cooking, driving a car, or summoning demons. You know, just the average guy kind of stuff.

Scientific breakthrough led to usage of microbe colonies as power sources in all aspects of life. Corporations that control these living batteries development and production became very weightful political powers in the world. Crime, inequality and corruption under their influence reached levels unimaginable before. In attempt to take this chaos under control governments reorganized their police forces and boosted them with top notch military gear. Titanium Hound is cutting edge manned complex designed to resolve very difficult situatiuons in urban conditions. Teleportation technology was the key to creating the power generating bacteria. Only non-organic objects remain the same during teleportation, but organic materials are completely different story regardless of how large they are. Through the teleportation process the first living batteries came to life, but in fear of unpredictable mutations any further teleportation of organic materials were declared illegal. Unfortunately, law wasn't enough to stop the obuse of this technology completely. Often referred to as Zombies, the abominations are result of pulling large organic beings through a teleportation device. There is only one way to survive in this merciless world \u2013 join a group that possess enough power on at least local level. This can be a corporation, a government, or a gang. But either way, you and the ones you side with won't be able to rely just on guns and physical capabilities. All organized groups use various gadgets and global network to defend themselves and attack their rivals. Drones of different sizes and outfits often come to play when it's too risky to handle business in person. Lethal machinery of all kinds serve to those who know cyber security protocols better and have more resources at their disposal. You are Titanium Hound pilot and a kind of cop who wants to protect and serve, helping commoners who were unlucky to get in the middle of gang wars. Abominations, hacked drones and crazed gangsters are just the tip of the iceberg you are trying to break down without full understanding the scope of the problem. You are prepared much better than any regular police unit, but even so your hands are often tied, especially when it comes to questioning corporate regulations.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202212/0418/Uy78nHtP0vob2PN1VX1PKHwL.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6606-CUSA40183_00-0876627551357161","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":74.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202212/0418/Uy78nHtP0vob2PN1VX1PKHwL.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Titanium Hound","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Fun Games LLC","ReleaseDate":"2023-03-10","Slug":"titanium-hound-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":149,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":96.85,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"Are you the new quiz master and can you beat your friends on this quiz?

Fight for a mercenary's glory and purse, for the justice of a folk in decline, for the light of purity or even for ChAoS itself. Every choice you make will determine how you approach the ever-changing Caverns of Chaos before you. CLASSIC ROGUELIKE VIRTUES MEET MODERN FEATURES Endless procedurally generated dungeons, countless monsters, items and a grand selection of very different skills allow for unlimited replayability. Interactive surroundings! Topple braziers, push coffins, smash doors or turn them into wooden golems to (hopefully) serve your bidding. Choose or toggle between graphic mode and traditional ASCII at any time. Toggle between 3D mode and top down view, in ASCII or in the graphic mode. Intuitive control system will get rid of the need to memorize hundreds of keys. Though you can still do so, if you're into that. We are not judging. UNRIVALED COMPLEXITY AND CONTENT A great variety of classes, genders, races and allegiances to choose from allow for extensive build diversity and change the way the game challenges you. NPCs will react differently, new quests will be open to you and the world may change completely based on your decisions. A deep magic system with several unique schools of magic and over 100 of spells to choose from, ranging from summoning demons to animating the very walls of the dungeon to aid you - the possibilities are endless. Over 80 skill trees and dozens of secret skills trees that are only waiting to be unlocked. A stealth system introduces a totally new way of playing the game: Instead of hacking or blasting all opposition to pieces you now can sneak past adversaries and avoid conflict. Turn yourself into an abomination and graft your enemies\u2019 body parts on yourself. They won\u2019t need them anymore, and what's better than wielding two swords? Two swords and an axe to harvest more body parts than ever before. CHALLENGING AND UNCOMPROMISING, YET REWARDING Countless options of how to tackle the dungeons awaiting you. Befriend or tame creatures, slay monsters, delve deeper or keep exploring and expanding the cavern levels you have already found. Over 200 different foes await, each requiring matching tactics. \"Dying is part of the fun\" - Each death is permanent. Your progress however will allow continuous improvement of future characters.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/2209/XFE7Pcq08lJbE95KwU5iHxHt.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5470-CUSA32146_00-0125212255162312","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":119.4,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/2209/XFE7Pcq08lJbE95KwU5iHxHt.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Ultimate ADOM - Caverns of Chaos","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Assemble Entertainment GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2023-01-12","Slug":"ultimate-adom--caverns-of-chaos-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":199,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":119.4,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

Sam is a six-foot canine detective with a nose for justice. Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they\u2019re the Freelance Police\u2014an irreverent comedy duo whose esoteric crime-fighting style has been entertaining comic book and video game fans for more than thirty years. In 2006\u20132010, Sam & Max starred in a series of episodic adventures created by Telltale Games. Now you can play their first two seasons (eleven episodes altogether!) in these remastered versions, which have been lovingly updated with gorgeous HD graphics, overhauled lighting and lip-sync, finessed cinematography, remastered audio, and several all-new musical tracks featuring live jazz musicians. SAM & MAX SAVE THE WORLD It's just another day at the office for the self-proclaimed Freelance Police when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam & Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the \"spinny thing\" they do with their eyes.) Who's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds. SAM & MAX: BEYOND TIME AND SPACE The Freelance Police are back on the crime beat in a showdown with Santa Claus, a race to subdue a giant volcano, and a face-off with a Eurotrash vampire. And then things get even weirder. Is paranoid shopkeeper Bosco on to something with his talk of a grand conspiracy?

Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they're the Freelance Police. And they're about to save the world. It's just another day at the office when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the \"spinny thing\" they do with their eyes.) Who's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds. ABOUT THIS REMASTER In 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within. Now everyone's favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell. Return to the adventure game that was once called \"gaming's first sitcom\" and is today known as \"the remaster you didn't know you were waiting for.\" With enhanced graphics, five new musical tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN's Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that you'll love to play\u2014or play again.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1517/6cR3MxF0nOi0WQxWQO4wa6FO.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5966-CUSA30837_00-8594065719104065","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIajN-DDmIk","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":139.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1517/6cR3MxF0nOi0WQxWQO4wa6FO.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Sam & Max Save the World","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SKUNKAPE GAMES","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-28","Slug":"sam--max-save-the-world-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":199,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":139.3,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"Tip Top is an arcade style climbing game with procedurally generated routes that never repeat themselves!

Industry is revolutionized overnight and a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common banner. A few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed. In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art.

Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

Recruit a company of up to three mortal heroes and guide them in spirit on a desperate journey from Albion to Jerusalem. Explore a richly-imagined medieval setting on the brink of apocalypse. Trade with merchants, improve your heroes and unearth ancient relics. Search for the lost fragments of your soul, scattered across the multiverse - and save as many worlds as you can. KEY FEATURES: A Roguelike Experience Carve a path across the lands of Albion, Marca Hispanica and Al-Andalus. Will you take a dangerous route, risking life and limb in pursuit of a legendary relic? Or will you choose a safer path? Plan and prepare. Negotiate, barter, fight. Tackle challenges. Suffer losses. Recruit new Heroes. Earn Gold, Supplies and Renown. Be careful: your choices are permanent, as is death. But don't tarry - evil never rests. Tactical Turn-Based Combat Master the tactics of squad-based and turn-based combat to conquer both human and demonic foes. Your enemies will be tough and ruthless; make use of high ground and cover, set up ambushes and coordinated attacks, harness synergies between different Hero classes and skills. Non-Linear Narrative Enjoy a compelling story inspired by Arthurian legend, the Matter of France, and the history of Al-Andalus - with an unusual twist. Make choices in interactive encounters that change every time you play. Written by Jonas Kyratzes (The Talos Principle, Serious Sam 4) and Verena Kyratzes (The Lands of Dream, Serious Sam 4). Hard Mode Suited for only the bravest adventurers. Experience an even greater challenge with complex resource management and tougher enemies. Earn Essence with each run that can be exchanged for Blessings and Curses, adding temporary benefits and burden in equal measure to your next run. Dynamic Leveling Use Renown to level up your Heroes, and choose between a randomized set of new skills or improved attributes. But choose wisely! Select skills with great synergy and balance your party for the road ahead. Equipment Upgrades Seek out towns to improve your arms and armor, or stumble upon hermit artisans in the wild. With every day that passes, the world plunges deeper into darkness, and you will need all the equipment gold can buy. Relics From a peasant's humble luck charm to the legendary sword wielded by Arthur himself, items imbued with magical power are scattered about the world. Some you will be able to purchase from merchants and collectors, but others will have to be earned through acts of heroism - or displays of wit. Spells Rain thunder and brimstone upon your foes! Seek out and gather Soulstones to restore your power and unlock new Spells. Even if defeated, your spirit will retain all of your collected arcane knowledge as you jump into the next dimension. Alternate Dimensions As you jump from one parallel dimension to the next, history is reshaped. Different kings rule the land, changing the encounters, characters, and events. No two worlds are ever quite the same, and each journey will be unique. And should your heroes fall, remember: defeat is not the end, only a new beginning. There are as many worlds as there are stars in the sky. In each stands Camelot; in each there is a Grail. But there is only one Merlin, and his eternal burden is to stand against the horror from beyond. Each world that is saved is saved forever; each world that is lost is lost for good.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"/game/92277","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png?w=200","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0131-PPSA04468_00-THEHANDMERLINPS5","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":114,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Hand of Merlin","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"VERSUS EVIL","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-14","Slug":"the-hand-of-merlin-ps4&ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":285,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":114,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"Congratulations!

But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they\u2019d ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she\u2019s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can\u2019t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years.

Your owner's naughty son destroyed your aquarium, and now you're desperately in need of water! Use what little liquid is left on the floor to move around and retreat to a toilet bowl which might save your life or flush you down into far more challenging realms, escaping which will require all of your agility and creativity! There are two ways to traverse the levels in Blow & Fly, rolling and blowing. You can roll along the floor and blow water out of your mouth, thus launching yourself in the opposite direction. Every time you hit the floor, you regain a small amount of liquid, just enough to get yourself into the air again. Utilize this ability to avoid hazards such as pitfalls or spikes, and make good use of the jump pads, gravity switches, keys and water drops to reach each watery safe haven. If you wish to survive, you will need to master your abilities, and for each obstacle you pass, there will be a greater challenge ahead! Features: \u2022 Experience an accessible yet challenging puzzle adventure! \u2022 Master precise physics-based controls to traverse levels. \u2022 Use water blasts to fly through the air or roll along the floor! \u2022 Conquer more than 70 levels of gradually increasing difficulty. \u2022 Find secret areas and collect pearls awarded for clever play. \u2022 Unlock new playable fish as you progress!

You will play as a free-floating ghost like creature. Basically, as the soul of someone who is experiencing the story.

You start by exploring the area and enjoying the feeling of flying as well as the gentle yet mysterious background music. Soon after starting to explore, you will find the first memory piece. You can collect the memory pieces to continue with the story and to advance with the overall narration. The story talks about a young boy, about his live and about how everything changes. It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. The first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become.

Get a babysitter for the kids, this game is a madcap, mile-a-minute spree of spies, dives, and gun-toting bad guys that will have you on the edge of your seat. You take on the role of Jack, a handsome, jaded former intelligence officer pulled out of his retired life as a strip club regular for one last mission to stop the villainous virologist Krueger, who plans to unleash a mind-controlling virus on the unsuspecting citizens of L.A. Everyone is out to kill Jack now that he\u2019s hot on Krueger\u2019s trail, and he\u2019ll need to use his mind, muscles, and mojo to stay alive long enough to stop Kruger\u2019s plot. Your spur-of-the-moment decisions will help or hinder Jack as he tries to find and protect the only scientist who has the cure to counter Krueger\u2019s deadly bioweapon. A restoration and remaster of a game lost to time for over 25 years, American Hero was originally designed for the Atari Jaguar CD as a \u201cplayable movie\u201d with a groundbreaking, more fluid presentation than the FMV games of its time. The game features the talents of professional actors, including Timothy Bottoms (The Last Picture Show, Johnny Got His Gun), Daniel Roebuck (The Fugitive, Final Destination), and Musetta Vander (O Brother, Where Art Thou, Wild Wild West). For this restoration, Timothy Bottoms reprises his role in newly recorded voiceovers of Jack\u2019s inner thoughts heard throughout the game. This restoration was rebuilt from the ground up with new game logic that delivers on the ambitious promise of the original game. This edition of the game includes new voicework from star Timothy Bottoms to accompany the original footage, completing the American Hero experience for the first time. American Hero features: \u2022 An explosive and adult-oriented Hollywood production with intense action, spicy encounters, and gut-busting laughs \u2022 A winding player-directed plot with multiple paths and endings \u2022 A unique FMV format that plays smoothly like watching a film \u2022 The return of Hollywood actor Timothy Bottoms as Jack with newly recorded voiceover","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"/game/100412","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/2203/ejzKp9VIndGcgNyCzJyu60bv.png?w=200","MainStory":2,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6260-CUSA25910_00-7748015696139721","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Unique","PlusPrice":96.85,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/2203/ejzKp9VIndGcgNyCzJyu60bv.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"American Hero","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Ziggurat Interactive, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-11","Slug":"american-hero-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":149,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":96.85,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"Gravitational is an Award-Winning VR physics-based puzzle game, that takes place in a utopic future, where large corporations are in a race with each other to develop \u2018gravitational travel & control\u2019 systems.

Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny. In Evertried, the player\u2019s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don\u2019t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"/game/98461","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3919-CUSA28219_00-EVERTRIEDPS4EU00","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImOYOo4RR4","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Strategy, Strategy","PlusPrice":113.4,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Evertried","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-20","Slug":"evertried-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":189,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":113.4,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"The Demon King's Castle in Ruins The human race attacking the Demon King's castle is nothing new and has happened countless times before.

Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37.

A place that will give you a lot of fun! In Train Station Renovation you play as a renovation company specialised in restoring railway stations. The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into 15 maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage. Quick and easy access to equipment is the key to success. There are many tools and options for repairing and decorating the station. Work with basic items such as paint rollers, spray cans, crowbars and repair wrenches or use your in-game tablet to order new materials and items. Some stations will even allow you to repair and renovate the old trains. This means you will be able to take care of the technical condition of those vehicles yourself. Specializations development tree An aesthetic development character tree t is available. You will speed up your work time at individual stages and elements of the game by upgrading your skills.

TY the Tasmanian Tiger™ 2: Bush Rescue™ is the sequel to Krome Studios' charming Australiana-themed videogame. This classic platformer, updated for PlayStation®4, features more rangs, more vehicles, more bots, and more EVERYTHING... in an open world Aussie Adventure. Throw boomerangs, bite, smash and glide your way around the Australian Outback and stop the evil plans of the wicked Boss Cass and help the good folk of the little country town of BURRAMUDGEE. This sequel to the popular TY the Tasmanian Tiger is a game on a grander scale. In addition to classic platforming elements, you'll fight Aussie bush fires from a helicopter, drive around Southern Rivers while hanging on to the back of a four-wheel drive and use the bots to defeat enemies and solve puzzles - all while trying to find a variety of different collectables. And now, only on the HD remaster, you can customise TY's looks, and best of all there are two brand NEW never before seen boomerangs. * Explore from the beach to the desert to the billabong and beyond in a huge open world of old-school 3D platforming glory. * Arm yourself with 20 different boomerangs including the classic Ironbark, Flamerang and two NEW rangs! * Brand new photo-mode. * A wide variety of vehicles like the Fourbie, cart, and mechs, too. * 7 Levels of two-player split-screen cart racing. * Improved camera & graphics; including updated shadows, reflections and HD resolutions. * New Gamemode called \"Hardcore Mode\". * Over 25 Trophies, including a Platinum Trophy, plus Speed Run and Time Attack Leaderboards. * Character customisation with NEW skins for TY and paint jobs for the Fourbie! * Audio Director's cut.

But one brave soul stood up to CASS, and thwarted his quest for the talismans. He risked all, in an effort to save his family and friends. And in the end... he succeeded. CASS was banished for his crimes, and the land was made safe once again. All thanks to the true blue Aussie hero, TY the Tasmanian Tiger, and his friends at BUSH RESCUE.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive? If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode! Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play. You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type. The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it.

This game is a remaster of the classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter, delivered with a new game engine, improved graphics, advanced dinosaur behaviors, and seamless player progression. Experience an out of this world hunting experience, as you track down and stalk dinosaurs! To survive you'll need to know your target\u2019s temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings, because you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end up being lunch. On your hunting adventure, you will visit beautiful but dangerous environments, each with their own unique Ecosystems. Explore the pristine beaches, dense jungles, rocky plains, and scorching deserts of planet FMM UV-32. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. You can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth tactics or gaining the high ground will give you an edge over the more vicious dinosaurs roaming the planet. Careful planning and consideration must be taken before every hunt including weapon choice. Will you use a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, or a silent crossbow? Maybe bring along a sidearm just in case. One of the most important items you will need is your handheld M.I.S.T. (Mobile Interstellar Satellite Transponder), which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking these beasts easier. There are other items you can bring on your hunt to improve your chances of survival such as Cover Scent, which masks your smell. You will track down a wide range of dinosaurs, each species with their own behavior patterns and intelligence levels - everything from \"pea-brained\" dummies to cunning apex predators, with heightened senses of sight, hearing, and smell. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species, each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, others will attack because they feel threatened, and the rest will kill anything that moves! So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted. Key Features: \u2022 Hunt down planet FMM UV-32\u2019s most dangerous creatures \u2013 the Dinosaurs! \u2022 A multitude of different Dinosaurs, from Herbivores (plant eaters) to the Carnivores (meat eaters). \u2022 Realistic AI \u2013 Dinosaurs react to sight, sound, and smell \u2013 with differing reactions and characteristics. \u2022 Explore and hunt throughout all of planet FMM UV-32\u2019s vast Ecosystems \u2022 Equip things like camouflage and Cover Scent to outsmart the dinosaurs. \u2022 A diverse range of weapons and equipment to hunt with. \u2022 Interactive Dinosaur Trophy Room. \u2022 Leaderboards including most money earned, high scores and max distance shots for every type of dinosaur.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"/game/115069","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/0915/6qq3rPzNJ70gGYecIFSMxNoN.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1082-CUSA23339_00-CARNIVORESGAME00","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Simulation","PlusPrice":104.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/0915/6qq3rPzNJ70gGYecIFSMxNoN.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunt","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Digital Dreams Entertainment LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-03","Slug":"carnivores-dinosaur-hunt-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":149,"MainExtra":4,"SalePrice":111.75,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"Tcheco is back for another herculean journey on his shiny new skateboard.

Guide your agency through the space race and write your alternate history of space travel - any of the agencies can be the first to land on The Moon if you make the right choices. Manage the numerous challenges faced then and now: \u2022 Create your base with launch pads, research labs, astronaut training facilities, and much more \u2022 Construct your own custom vehicles from hundreds of combinations \u2022 Launch satellites and crewed spacecraft to explore the Solar System \u2022 Run mission control as you solve the various challenges of turn-based missions to earn scientific advancement and public support \u2022 Explore an extensive tech tree and compete or collaborate with other agencies to plot your roadmap to Mars \u2022 Choose from five unique space agencies, each with their own traits, base, vehicles, and spacecraft \u2022 Create your own custom space agency You\u2019re in charge of every element of the journey into space: success rides on your decisions. Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet? Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies? Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars. Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors. Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment. These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue? Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We\u2019ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"/game/85154","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png?w=200","MainStory":12,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5277-CUSA18418_00-0000000000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gqbz8C8bX0","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":92,"genre":"Strategy","PlusPrice":56.76,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Mars Horizon","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"THE IRREGULAR CORPORATION LTD.","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-17","Slug":"mars-horizon-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":172,"MainExtra":34,"SalePrice":56.76,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"The Perplexing Orb returns!

Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming.

Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open! Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie.

Ever. This bundle contains SUPERHOT - the award-winning first-person shooter in which time moves only when you move, SUPERHOT VR - the absolute must-play staple of virtual reality, and SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE \u2013 the followup non-VR title painstakingly created over three years of grueling production to satisfy your intense need for more SUPERHOT. Getting all games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT\u2019s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem. Immerse yourself in the brutalist, concrete world of SUPERHOT. Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world. You can be truly free. SUPERHOT Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets. SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT\u2019s signature power fantasy. You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they\u2019re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched. Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel. You take a moment to consider. You\u2019ve been here before. So many times. Maybe this time it will actually mean something. SUPERHOT VR Decisive winner of dozens of VR Game of the Year awards, SUPERHOT VR is a title reimagined and redesigned from the ground up for VR and hand tracking controllers. The fruit of over three years of close cooperation between the critically acclaimed SUPERHOT Team and Oculus, SUPERHOT VR brings the intensely visceral action of SUPERHOT directly into your head and soul. And now \u2013 directly into your VR headset too. The game will test your limits. It will bring pain \u2013 of the good kind. In the end you will prevail. You will be one with the system.","SaleStarted":"2023-06-06","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2477-CUSA18510_00-7827683902308671","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":190,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"THE COMPLETE SUPERHOT BUNDLE","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Superhot","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-16","Slug":"the-complete-superhot-bundle-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":475,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":190,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-21","description":"Previous special offer price valid from 28-04-2021 to 12-05-2021 was (£11.24 / \u20ac13.49 / AU $17.97 / BGN 26.95 / CZK 359.55 / DKK 98.55 / HUF 4765 / NZ $24.72 / NOK 148.05 / PLN 55.8 / SEK 139.05 / USD $12.14 / ZAR 242.55 / HRK 98.55 / INR 899 / TRY 98.55 / ILS 53.55) For the first time ever, gods, holy spirits and mythological characters from around the globe and throughout history will clash in an explosive 2D fighter where the entire world is at stake!

On her first day at Dudsdale Elementary, 10-year old Jess accidentally gets everybody's favorite collectible card game banned, forcing the kids to take their card battles underground. Troubles arise when mutants from the game invade the real world, and it's up to Jess and friends to stop them. From the award-winning indie game studio, Gambrinous, creators of Guild of Dungeoneering, comes an RPG where battles are played with an epic collectible card game. Cardpocalypse takes you back to the 1990's, a time when computers used floppy disks, and people read magazines for video game cheat codes. You will explore Dudsdale Elementary on a mission to build killer card decks in an effort to defeat the mutants. You will have to trade, earn, wager, change rules and permanently alter cards on your way to victory. \u2022 BE A CHAMPION: Build your decks around the ultra rare Champion cards you earn. Each Champion comes with unique abilities to tailor your deck around. First player to get their opponent's Champion card's health to zero wins the match. \u2022 GO MEGA: Champion cards evolve to their MEGA forms when their health halves, doing more attack damage and gaining new powers. \u2022 CHANGE THE GAME: The kids sometimes use house rules and who knows what the Mutants will change. Throughout the game you will choose the new rules and conditions as well as renaming your favorite cards and giving them upgrades using stickers. Create entirely new cards using the Mega Mutant Power Magazine. But be careful, these decisions are permanent. \u2022 GET SCRAPPY: Adventure throughout the school to unravel the strange occurrences at Dudsdale Elementary. Take on quests to earn cards, stickers, and candy which you can collect and trade with your classmates. Careful, there's no backsies! \u2022 YOU CAN'T COLLECT 'EM ALL: In the end, your decks and rules will be unique to you. Stickers are rare, choices matter, and sometimes you'll have to make a tough decision to get the best cards. \u2022 THE 1990's: Through its totally rad, choice-driven, interactive narrative, Cardpocalypse delivers the experience of being a 90's kid.
