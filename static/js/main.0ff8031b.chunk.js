A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age. The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station Cities struggle for survival, both with each other and the mutant horrors that await outside. You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised underground. Having never ventured beyond the city limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat.

In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness.

Players must make quick decisions and choose every action and attack they make, all the while considering their immediate cost and consequences. Featuring a unique blend of strategic time-based action, John Wick Hex captures the feel of the tactical combat from the films and blurs the line between the strategy and action video game genres.

Experience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game\'s eponymous villain \'Hex\'.

Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to. Scale Massive Beasts ------------------------------- Overcome impossible odds to climb atop and defeat the massive beasts that are bound to this land. Climb, Glide, Swim ------------------------------- You can climb on virtually anything you can get your hands on, from ruins and mountains to the massive beasts that inhabit the land. Ascend to the tops of mountains and then glide over the open world to reach previously inaccessible locations. Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don\'t stay in too long or your swim could become your last. Explore, Craft, and Survive ------------------------------- You\'ll arrive on a frozen island with only the clothes on your back -- it\'s up to you to survive. Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn\'t the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait. Make Your Path ------------------------------- Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course. Unravel the Mystery ------------------------------- Why won\'t the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to. A Beautifully Frigid World ------------------------------- Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog. The remnants of an ancient civilization lie before you, but don\'t let awe turn into carelessness -- snow storms can crop up at any moment and bury you in a blizzard. Luckily, you can leave footprints in the snow and follow your footsteps back if you are lost.","Title":"PRAEY FOR THE GODS","SaleStarted":"2022-08-27","LowestPrice":"","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"No Matter Studios LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-12-14","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png?w=200","Slug":"praey-for-the-gods-playstation","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1880-PPSA02131_00-3768321134104813","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzDl2THyF4w","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":29.99,"PercentOff":"35%","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":19.49,"SalePrice":19.49,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"45","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/infinity-runner","SaleEnds":"2022-09-01","description":"The Infinity is the largest spaceship ever built by man-kind flung into the void of space to secure humanity a new home amongst the stars.

The game centers on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within.

As well as these evasive elements there\u2019s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations.

We\u2019re counting on you to find the truth behind the bounty on your head and see if there\u2019s a bigger destiny for you out there.

Use stealth and tactics to overcome the never-ending onslaught of monsters, the manifestations of your god\'s decay. DEFINITIVE UPDATE: \u25aa 3 new enemy types. Prepare to fight swarms of feral bats, witches of the wood, and elder vampires. \u25aa 30 new weapons with unique abilities to add to your arsenal. \u25aa Overwatch added to ease up your ambushes. Snipe any foes running into your range. \u25aa Tug of war mechanics. Push a beast into a trap or pull it into the range of ally\'s overwatch. \u25aa Rebalance of corruption system. Cursed weapons and items give you immense power but at a cost of slowly losing yourself. \u25aa New questline: uncover dark secrets of House Blackwell. \u25aa New hunter skin - hunt in style. FEATURES: \u25aa Stealth, ambush-based combat. Try to outsmart and outwit all the horrifying creatures you\u2019ll be facing, as they are way stronger and you don\u2019t stand a chance in a direct assault; \u25aa Diverse, challenging opponents. From werewolves to vampires, all monsters have their unique attacks and skills and can easily see, hear or smell you from the distance. So be careful not to reveal your position too early; \u25aa Stamina-based characters. Cautiously manage your energy level between attacking, moving and casting spells. In the end, you\u2019re only a human and running out of energy will seriously fatigue you; \u25aa A grim world plunged in half-darkness. In this world, our god has finally turned his back on us and his corrupt presence can change the intensity of the battlefield. From summoning monsters, through changing the weather, to transforming one of the creatures into a powerful avatar of his will; \u25aa A vagabond\u2019s exploration system. Travel the world bringing your mobile base along with you. Take shelter in and manage your camp, but be wary of enemy ambushes; \u25aa A unique fusion of dark Victorian fantasy and wild west. Immerse yourself in a world so different from the one you know. The universe shaped by struggle, where mankind has not had the freedom to develop or advance any of its technology. Manage your scarce resources, venture out with your fellow companions and explore the remnants of the world in search of the means for mankind\'s survival. Monsters can detect a hunter\'s presence by their scent, they can then use this to track down where the hunters are. Observe the wind - keeping yourself downwind of your adversaries will aid you in your hunt. Although, hunters can use their scent to their advantage by preparing an ambush using traps, then luring the monsters towards it. Monsters are not the only threat the hunters will face on their hunts - the presence of the old god is growing ever stronger, changing everything it touches. The darkness can summon more enemies against the hunters, or even change them into an avatar of its will. Hunters can equip different weapons, heavy, more powerful ones that will drain their stamina when used. And smaller ones, better for stealth actions. Within their camp, our hunters can craft new items or get some rest. In addition, we can assign roles to hunters there, e.g. to make one of them guard the camp and protect it from ambushes, or to give them the role of a scavenger, who will collect resources in the region of the camp. Remember, this is not the world you know. This is a world that has been shaped by struggle, one where mankind has not had the freedom to develop and advance its technology. Your resources will be limited, and opportunities rare.","Title":"Alder\'s Blood: Definitive Edition","SaleStarted":"2022-08-27","LowestPrice":"","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"No Gravity Games S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2022-04-28","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202204/0811/3xDrQnV0UuO525rinrdlIOBH.png?w=200","Slug":"alders-blood-definitive-edition-playstation","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6673-CUSA30730_00-0957437476024690","Trailer":"","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"PercentOff":"30%","genre":"Role Playing Games, Strategy","PlusPrice":12.99,"SalePrice":13.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-01","description":"This collection of 2 Little Nightmares games will introduce you to a lovely, frightening, and iconic puzzle-platformer series, starting with the original.

It offers an immersive experience of commanding both sides of the conflict, allowing you to gain a unique understanding of the situation through the eyes of both sides\' top commanders, resulting in enjoyable and insightful gameplay. Build up, train, and equip your troops with the newest weaponry available to maximize their efficiency and set sail for victory. The core element of the game is large-scale naval battles with numerous carrier ships bringing so much more aircraft into the battle for seizing control over the ocean. Upon overtaking the sea you will have to set foot on hostile land through a series of costly landing operations. You will have to make your naval, aerial, and amphibious forces act as one flawless mechanism - a task only a truly strategic mind can achieve.

Reveal the visions and fears that torment Mark. Although only he was knowledgeable about them... or someone else? The objective is to gather the fragments of the Spiritual board, found around the house, to be able to contact Rose, her mother, and discover the truth. The whole argument of Evil Inside happens in a mysterious house ... or almost everything. Explore Mark\'s house that is constantly changing. Slowly the atmosphere will change. Nothing is what it seems. Beat your fears. Face terror and truth. But above all... enjoy a real horror experience. Everything has been very strange. Why did dad do that? He is now in prison. He was a good person... Something is not right. I need to know the truth... but only she knows. Or she knew it. I need to talk to her, I need to discover the truth. What happened? You sit on the couch. The situation overcomes you. In a very short time your life has taken a 180\xba turn. Almost without realizing it, you live alone. In charge of your little brother. You go to the kitchen, a creak. The light blinks suddenly. You are alone, or so you think. To all this, it continues to haunt you not to know the truth, there is nothing clear in this whole story. Something does not add up... Your biggest fears come true. Loneliness and darkness invade you. What\'s going on?

Barely. Take on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it\'s heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you\'re lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you\'re wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.

Only through these right pairings will characters reveal their true selves, and bestow you with the most powerful stories, the true ones which reveal something about their own lives.","Title":"Where the Water Tastes Like Wine","SaleStarted":"2022-08-27","LowestPrice":"","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"Serenity Forge","ReleaseDate":"2019-12-02","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307Ql5qzJ38p7eBWMeZahxw8vY5N6i733KicqdsPHorkuQpb8PlKCgesbPJeG-qgkD3WL_l2hmJVXqtYSG2euII3wBpsYk.png?w=200","Slug":"where-the-water-tastes-like-wine-playstation","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0604-CUSA16372_00-0000000000WTWTLW","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0YSX0Eot-c","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"PercentOff":"60%","genre":"Adventure, Adventure, Adventure","PlusPrice":7.99,"SalePrice":7.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-01","description":"Football is all about fun and teamwork.
