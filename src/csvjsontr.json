Quill is back—and she’s being hunted. Those who seek to unmake this world are desperate for the Glass she holds, and they’ll stop at nothing to claw it from her grasp. But the young hero has a plan of her own, one that could finally end the merciless rule of the Arcane and restore peace to Moss once more. To stand a chance, Quill will need a true partner by her side—and we hope that partner is you. With her, you’ll venture deep inside the hexed castle of the Arcane where dangerous terrain, challenging puzzles, and enemies twisted in fire and steel await.

Dwindling Heights is a dangerous place for a little Mouse, and Tilo's hardly a fighter. When confronted by deadly enemies twice your size, guile and swiftness are your only allies.

You’re here to test our newest, state-of-the-art military-grade color-technology: The ChromaGun (patent pending)! Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You’re the perfect candidate for our test chambers!

Navigate by boat, discover islands, find new allies to help battle foes, and experience a humorous tale about friendship in this melancholic and atmospheric escape. Rich, Story-Driven Adventure Earth may be flooded, but it’s one heck of a view on the water. With a sense of humor, determination, and some great tunes, Nikos and friends will work together to explore the water-filled environment around them and embark on an adventure to evacuate to Mars and start a new life. 3D Exploration & Discovery Float along the vast waterways freely in your boat and explore the many different islands of a beautiful world where you’ll encounter danger, interact with fellow citizens, gather resources, and fight for a chance to escape to a new life. Turn-Based Combat With A Twist Take on your enemies in a classic turn-based combat system where careful tactics and puzzle solving will help you come out alive. Interact with the environment and items around you: knock down a tree, push a shopping cart into an enemy, or duck behind a turned over car to gain the advantage.

As you cruise along the water, Highwater Pirate Radio is the key source not only of unique and original music, but also for commentary on your ticket to survival.

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike. There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series. This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians. Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields. It’s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive – lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Just make sure you don’t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies! The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front), with a new game Isonzo coming soon with mountain warfare on the Italian Front! These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references. **Cross play supported between console platforms.**","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202002/2812/7lTuF0Wo4f9DT4oMjxx2xks4.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1662-PPSA02756_00-9956598540657310","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":23,"genre":"Action, Shooter, Shooter","id":"EP1662-PPSA02756_00-9956598540657310","PlusPrice":124.75,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/tannenberg/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Popularity":"","Title":"Tannenberg","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BlackMill Games B.V.","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-15","Slug":"tannenberg-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"499.00","MainExtra":21,"SalePrice":"124.75","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"61","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"/game/61474","description":"The Naruto franchise is back with a brand new experience in NARUTO TO BORUTO: SHINOBI STRIKER!

Will you walk in your father's footsteps and live up to his name? Only one way to find out. You can't take the 'truck' out of 'food truck'.

When you feel you're short on time do as your father did and veer off the beaten path. First come, first served! You might've thought that all there is to this business is fast food, but now that you're on the other side of the counter it's time to think again.

As you play, you'll feel yourself reaching for your dice and miniatures. It's time to dive into the world of Solasta! Roll for initiative, take attacks of opportunity, manage player location and the verticality of the battle field. Set yourself up for the finishing strike and possibly roll a natural 20 at that key moment of a battle. In Solasta, you take control of four heroes, each with unique skills that complement one another. Every hero expresses themselves in the adventure, making each action and dialogue choice a dynamic part of the story. Players will create their heroes just as they would in a pen-and-paper game by choosing their race, class, personality, and rolling for their stats. You make the choices, dice decide your destiny. An Epic Team Adventure Discover the shattered world of Solasta. Explore ruins and dungeons for legendary treasures, learn the truth of an age-old cataclysm—and stop it from happening again. Create your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. Tailor your squad to your preferred strategy and maximize your party's abilities. The choice is yours. Online Multiplayer Co-op Play any campaign with up to 4 players for more fun and shenanigans! The best part? The host shares all their DLC with the other players! Time to fireball some friends. Discover a Mysterious & Dynamic World Delve into long-forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. Fight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over—on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground. Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. Size also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though—the monsters are also thinking vertically. Custom Campaigns In Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the official campaign is over.

Play as Liam or Sophia, the newest member of the Lilygrove Scout Corps, as the young mice find themselves on the journey of a lifetime to save their home from ruthless pirates. Will they reach Redwall and save their friends before all is lost? The Scout Act 1 After months of training, betrothed mice Liam and Sophia are ready to graduate into fully-fledged Scouts: a group of woodland rangers tasked with the protection of the land and trained in the ancient ways of woodcraft. Their initiate ceremonies are cut short when sea rats attack their beloved home. As the senior Scouts rally for battle, it's up to the Scout Corps' newest recruit to outwit the enemy, light the beacon, and summon aid from the surrounding woodlands - before there is nothing left to save. The Scout Act 2 The beacon is lit, troops rally to fend off the invading searats, and Liam reunites with his dear Sophia beneath the Lilygrove Lighthouse, but not all is well. Scumsnout's vengeful cries can be heard in the distance and it is revealed that our Scout's betrothed has been poisoned by the wereat's venomous bite. With no time to spare, the couple race to the Winsome Wraith, where a mysterious and dangerous stoat may have the antidote they seek. As if things weren't bad enough, the sea rats are moving inland and the shadow of a large predatory bird lurks just at the edge of the woods. The Scout: Act 3 After being mortally poisoned by Scumsnout's vicious maw, our young Scouts have made it to the Winsome Wraith in one piece, if just barely. While the mysterious stoat's treatment has bought some precious time, Liam and Sophia must now travel the rest of the way to Redwall Abbey for a more permanent cure. This is the dramatic conclusion of their journey through the murk of Portman's Slough, the miraculously-functioning puzzles of Grating Gulley, and the ancient ruins of the Otters' Den. Features - A brand new original story set the winter before the events of the first book. - A stunning woodland world inhabited by charming critters and villainous vermin. - Two characters with divergent dialog for replayability. - Unique real-time scent mechanic fitting for woodlanders who experience the world primarily through their noses. - An assortment of achievements and collectables for the completionist spirit. - Original soundtrack created especially for fans of Redwall. - Fully voice acted by a talented cast of new and established actors. - Engaging puzzles and side stories for those who delight in world building. Mechanics - \"The Scout\" debuts a dynamic scent system unlike any game before it. Rather than stagnant, pre-designed paths that imitate scent, particles read the wind and the environment to simulate realistic currents and pools. Scents themselves consist of parts and patterns designed around real scent theory. - When traversing the world of Mossflower, you make use of your mouse agility to explore the world in a unique and wondrous way. Shimmy along ledges, scramble sheer cliffs, and even squeeze through impossibly small spaces. With courage, faith, and friends by your side, Mossflower's fate rests in your paws! - Rely on stealth, wit, and agility to evade your enemies. Manipulate dull-witted vermin with scent and scent to avoid getting caught in their grubby paws. - Use your trusty way glass to scope the area and identify danger. Rely on your home-made slingshot to solve puzzles, break pots, and activate traps. - Decide if you will prioritize the mission and leave the others to save themselves or take the time to lend a helping paw. Some may praise philanthropy, still others would praise pragmatism.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/2420/4ba54ae01e578167c094b2026586777854dccd6aa4c40a40.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2099-CUSA46220_00-0878668103727367","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Family, Adventure, Action","id":"EP2099-CUSA46220_00-0878668103727367","PlusPrice":179.6,"Popularity":"","Title":"The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Forthright Entertainment, LLC","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-10","Slug":"the-lost-legends-of-redwall-the-scout-anthology-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"449.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"269.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"","description":"Borzoi Adventure invites players into a whimsical world where they embody the spirited Borzoi, a graceful canine explorer embarking on an epic journey through enchanting realms brimming with treasures and challenges.

Take flight on a pimped-up jetboard and face off against massive, multi-stage bosses. A classic for the next generation! An intense, arcade-style, 'bullet hell' SHMUP/STG in which you must master a vast array of ridiculous weaponry in order to defeat a race of evil aliens who are intent on abducting innocent civilians and turning them into mutants. Jetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern roguelikes. Don't expect a story. Do expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced 60fps action, big guns, and explosions! The Jetboard: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock. The Enemies: Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game's weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too… The Weapons: From the conventional to the ridiculous! Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission! and leave a path of total destruction in your wake. Get up close and dish out massive damage with the shotgun, wreak havoc with the cluster bomb, fry enemies to a crisp with the flame tornado or shock them into submission with the lightning bolt. You'll get a different selection of weapons with each playthrough and you'll need to master them all! The Bosses: Defeat huge bosses in a series of grueling multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use. Rendered in exquisite pixel-art detail, these guys will test your weapon-handling and evasive maneuvering to their limits. The Planets: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons. Adapt your route based on your playstyle, the weapons you unlock and the treasure you discover.

Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise. But what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart. Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilnessâ„¢. Features: • Everything is better with Dwarvesâ„¢: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources. • It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! • Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. • New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. • Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. • Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. • Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. • Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

Your adventure begins on a distant island, deep in a tropical Archipelago. What was once a prosperous tourist destination is now a shade of its former glory: and it’s your job to bring it back to life! Explore the Archipelago, meet the locals, and lend them a hand to restore the tourist paradise… while you try to uncover the mysteries of your past! SETTLING IN A NEW PLACE Your tropical life will be a busy one, so grab your tools and let’s get started! First things first: you’ll need a source of food, a place to spend the night in, and some resources to build a farm and kickstart your tropical journey. So what are you waiting for — time to explore your lands! A PLETHORA OF ACTIVITIES There’s plenty to do in Spirit of the Island! No matter how you choose to spend your time, you will gain experience and improve your skills, unlock new recipes, and become more efficient at everything you do, which will make your new life easier. Spirit of the Island features 10 unique skills, such as farming, mining, foraging, social, and even fishing, which comes as its own special mini-game. Will you become a true master of all? YOUR JOURNEY TO A TOURIST PARADISE Make your island not only a welcoming home but also a booming tourist paradise, with fancy shops and landmarks. The more tourists you get, the better your economy will be, which is a crucial step to fund your journeys to the faraway Islands. But how do you please them all, and what do you sell in your stores? That’s where your skills will come in handy! Sell local produce; open museums to display the treasure and secrets you uncover on your adventures. We bet some of your visitors could even buy a couple of quality wooden planks, so do your best to improvise! THE BEST TRIP EVER Each tourist will have a chance to love your Island so much that they’ll decide to stay, adding to the Town’s population. This part is crucial since you can hire them to do various things for you, such as tending to your shops and helping you maintain the Island. So do your best to make their trip a fantastic one! THE POWER OF TWO One of the main features of Spirit of the Island is a 2-player cooperative mode, where you can do… everything together! You will have all single-player mode features available in online play with its own unique story. Grow crops, set up a store, and sell your produce to tourists, explore the vast Archipelago, and discover the secrets of the tropical paradise together with a friend! VAST TROPICAL ARCHIPELAGO Spirit of the Island features 14 explorable islands, each with its own fauna, secrets, and dangers. Information on who - or what - inhabits these islands has been lost to history, but you will find mysterious caves guarded by ancient creatures — are you brave enough to explore them and uncover the mysteries within? Doing so will net you neat rewards and help you proceed towards your final goal: revealing the secret of your past. THE LOCAL COMMUNITY The Archipelago is bustling with life! Meet more than 14 unique characters, each with its own distinct traits and quirks. And yes, there are romance options as well! Depending on your character, you’ll be able to romance and marry different NPCs and hold a grandiose wedding in the end! AN EVENTFUL LIFE One of the unique features of Spirit of the Island is events — a series of recurring occurrences happening through each in-game year (4 months). They will come in various forms: from birthdays and traditional Holidays to your own unique events. There’s always something fun happening in Town, so make sure to check your calendar often!","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/1615/jfTgsNhsgDDUp0kpRg2yoevL.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1302-PPSA13934_00-0584770477306422","MainStory":31,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure, Simulation, Party","id":"EP1302-PPSA13934_00-0584770477306422","PlusPrice":440.3,"Popularity":"","Title":"Spirit of the Island","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Plug In Digital","ReleaseDate":"2023-10-19","Slug":"spirit-of-the-island-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"471.75","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"","description":"This bundle contains unique: - Exclusive SOUNDTRACK available only on PlayStation - 3 Exclusive Avatars - Exclusive Dynamic Theme (available only on PS4) - Harmony's Odyssey Full Game Harmony’s Odyssey is a 3D fantasy adventure puzzle game set on mythical dioramas full of riddles, perky creatures, and magic.

Cila, a veteran cop with a sour outlook and anger issues expects nothing more from life besides the smell of ozone, blinding neon lights and the ever-present manhole steam. That is, until a shady friend replaces her broken-down housedroid as a favor. Advanced, more efficient and remarkably perceptive, unit M.A.R.A. begins to penetrate Cila's toughened exterior and possibly even heal her new owner's old wounds – if Cila can decipher the recurring nightmare the process brings. Soon Cila and Mara forge a unique, if sometimes uneasy bond. Unbeknownst to Cila, just as her life begins to find its new normal, the technological giant Velta Labs gets wind of Mara's existence and takes a mysterious interest in the android. A war unlike any before is brewing on the horizon, its players are silently being selected and one android's fate may spell the difference between peace, war, the blossoming of a new religion or a technological singularity beyond comprehension. ---- Plus, one year after the events of the Synergia Incident, Cila and Mara's lives have drastically changed, as have the lives of all those around them. This edition includes SUNRISE, a small glimpse into their future outside of The Empire, and the repercussions of their actions during the main game. Bathed in the ultraviolet lights of the European Travel Union, Yu, the Emperor's right-hand, prepares to reunite with the reviled Cila and Mara and finally settle things with The Empire's most wanted terrorist: Yoko.

Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends in mind, whether you bring them from your childhood or make them along the road. The PAYDAY-series has always valued the bonds made through hardship and tries to reflect that in the actions and words of our heisters while in the game, and through our community while on the outside.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/3114/74af13c80bb9904ee00b043108f4f18e32bb08aaed6032ea.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8459-PPSA14411_00-PAYDAY3SILVEREU0","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Shooter","id":"EP8459-PPSA14411_00-PAYDAY3SILVEREU0","PlusPrice":1136.85,"Popularity":"","Title":"PAYDAY 3: Silver Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PLAION","ReleaseDate":"2023-09-21","Slug":"payday-3-silver-edition-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1749.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"1136.85","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"","description":"The Beyond the Dawn Deluxe Edition includes: • Tales of Arise • Beyond the Dawn Expansion • Classic Characters Costume & Arranged BGM Pack • Premium Travel Pack Artifacts and items • Starter Pack Artifacts, items, and gald For 300 years, Rena has ruled over Dahna, pillaging the planet of its resources and stripping people of their dignity and freedom.

The game features traditional turn-based combat with real-time execution of moves: blocking, countering and timing your attacks carefully as well as predicting your foes' moves is essential to succeed in your cosmic quest. In this galaxy where every action means a reaction, you’ll play as Virgo, the Holy Queen (often called Dreadful Queen by heretics). Guide Virgo as she embarks upon a twisted and unforgiving cosmic quest to bring back the Golden Age, a period of peace, symmetry and balance–or so she thinks. Bring mayhem to the Zodiac Realms and leave a trail of stardust on your way, all to help others conform to Virgo’s excessively righteous worldview and see the light. KEY FEATURES: A unique turn based combat system featuring timed-actions and counterattacks. No random encounters: every fight is a unique challenge designed specifically for the player. A focus on exploration and discovery, with multiple endings. Zodiac Memories: peer behind the veil to explore the backstories of the Zodiacs! Boss Rush Mode: face off against all of the game’s bosses in a gauntlet that will test your mastery and combat abilities.

There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner. You will progress through main missions, you’ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises... If you’ll be prospering, you’ll get the chance to create and manage bases in five different regions, each with its own, more and more challenging missions. From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there’ll be a pesky agent who’ll want to work with you, and there’ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You’re a free man, after all. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught!

Kisejima, where the game takes place, is divided into three areas with a variety of challenges ranging from fighting enemies to escort missions.

Here, it is said that the power that lies dormant within the local demon spirits can be drawn out by challenging them to trials, where ancient demons who were once defeated by Momotaro are summoned to battle. However, few have ever returned from Kisejima alive. â– Characters: Kuuta, a demon warrior, and his spirit partner, Kazemaru Kuuta, the protagonist, is the only survivor of the Demon King's army that faced Momotaro in battle.

Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades. While most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go. You are one of those people. In-depths Survival Mechanics: Keep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point. Combat and Crime System: How far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are. Winter is Coming: Spend the last few days of autumn wisely – gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again. Expansive Story: Unlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav. Homeless, But Not Hopeless: Maybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own. You Are Not Alone: Is surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter.

Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":16,"genre":"Action, Adventure, Music/Rhythm","id":"EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","PlusPrice":94.75,"Popularity":"","Title":"ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Untold Tales S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-09","Slug":"atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"379.00","MainExtra":5,"SalePrice":"94.75","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"/game/106120","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game.

He progresses on his journey, raiding trading convoys, upgrading the ships and, of course, always keeping an eye on the morale of the crew. While doing so, he tries to persuade fellow pirate captains to join his fleet, all with with their own ships and individual abilities. With even bigger prizes in his sights, he will not stop until he is undisputedly the greatest pirate of the Caribbean.

MEET YOUR CREW’S NEEDS • As an elected captain of the ship, it is your responsibility to split the spoils and riches with your crew. Agreeing on so-called ‘articles of capture’ clearly define the objectives you embark on before leaving port. Remember the whispers of mutiny below the decks can lead to nasty outcome. After all, you are an elected captain and not placed by the grace of the Lord.

Choose your allegiance carefully, for you are nothing more than an expendable asset to the masters you choose. Fight for a mercenary's glory and purse, for the justice of a folk in decline, for the light of purity or even for ChAoS itself.

Two swords and an axe to harvest more body parts than ever before. CHALLENGING AND UNCOMPROMISING, YET REWARDING Countless options of how to tackle the dungeons awaiting you. Befriend or tame creatures, slay monsters, delve deeper or keep exploring and expanding the cavern levels you have already found. Over 200 different foes await, each requiring matching tactics. \"Dying is part of the fun\" - Each death is permanent. Your progress however will allow continuous improvement of future characters.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/2209/XFE7Pcq08lJbE95KwU5iHxHt.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5470-CUSA32146_00-0125212255162312","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP5470-CUSA32146_00-0125212255162312","PlusPrice":99.8,"Popularity":"","Title":"Ultimate ADOM - Caverns of Chaos","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Assemble Entertainment GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2023-01-12","Slug":"ultimate-adom-caverns-of-chaos-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"499.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"99.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"/game/86460","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game.

You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies.

Bounty hunters, space pirates, and even the Galactic Union are trying to hunt you down. All that stands between you and oblivion is your wits, your crew, and your trusty ship. The Galactic Junkers is a comedic action-adventure space combat game that puts you in the role of a space captain on the run. Your ship might be falling apart and your crew isn’t the best but with a little luck you can keep everything ship-shape. Upgrade your ship, hire new crew, steal supplies and equipment, and keep searching for the truth of why everyone wants you dead. Explore Take a journey across the solar system exploring all nine planets and their neighboring sectors. Discover mysterious asteroids, creaking space stations, abandoned shipwrecks, deadly pirates and much more. Mine, Salvage, Steal, and Trade Running a spaceship is never easy and there’s always bills to pay. Keep your bank balance looking healthy by mining asteroids, salvaging derelicts, and trading with disreputable characters. Maybe you’ll even partake in a little theft, but don’t worry - we don’t tell anyone. Battle and Board Enemy Ships Space is a deadly place so you’ll have to fight for your life. Set your crew to operate the guns and show those pesky pirates what you are made of! Board enemy ships to smash and grab essential resources or hack systems from the shadows. Hire and Maintain your Crew A happy ship needs a happy crew, so look after your band of useful idiots.

Buy, Upgrade, and Repair Ships Maybe you need a little more juice in the engine department or your guns are falling short. Upgrade your ship to take control of the sector and make a name for yourself. Or if you prefer something a little fancier, trade in your ship for a better model. Just don’t forget your maintenance routines! Protect You and Your Ship at all Costs Try not to get yourself blown up, captured, or otherwise incapacitated. We’re counting on you to find the truth behind the bounty on your head and see if there’s a bigger destiny for you out there. Explore strange new worlds, meet weird new people, try dodgy food, and boldly fumble where no space captain has fumbled before, just don't get your exhaust ports blown off!","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1914/3yOYk8fzFrjV4l5AVGUcDvjW.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3430-CUSA34287_00-4988856559772079","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action","id":"EP3430-CUSA34287_00-4988856559772079","PlusPrice":87.25,"Popularity":"","Title":"The Galactic Junkers","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Green Man Gaming Publishing","ReleaseDate":"2022-07-07","Slug":"the-galactic-junkers-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"349.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"87.25","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"","description":"The season starts now – grab your racket and become the world’s next tennis champion!

The Ultimate Edition contains: Dying Light 2 Stay Human Exclusive Weapon Charms Legendary Equipment Digital Comic & Wallpapers Digital Artbook & Soundtrack Story DLC 1: Bloody Ties Access to Story DLC 2 Consumable items It’s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE DEAD Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/2908/HSg5GbvwYMeUj770IcWrHmsi.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-ULTIMATEEDITIOEU","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"34%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Unique","id":"EP2911-PPSA02262_00-ULTIMATEEDITIOEU","PlusPrice":1484.34,"Popularity":"","Title":"Dying Light 2 Stay Human – Ultimate Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TECHLAND SP.

Making a cheaper and more immediate decision only affects me and is it really interesting in the long run? It is the answers to these questions that the player will find on their own, in a natural and meaningful way, throughout the game. As for the story, the game takes place in a fantasy medieval universe where all characters are animalized. The protagonist is an adventurer who seeks treasure and excitement, but sees his best friend and adventure partner being possessed and kidnapped by a powerful and evil being from the underworld.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0119/7TjNay2zAJB1ZFBtwql2Li6v.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0546-CUSA24239_00-RIFTAPS4QUBYTEEU","MainStory":3,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure, Action","id":"EP0546-CUSA24239_00-RIFTAPS4QUBYTEEU","PlusPrice":79.6,"Popularity":"","Title":"Rift Adventure","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"QUBYTE","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-15","Slug":"rift-adventure-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"199.00","MainExtra":4,"SalePrice":"99.50","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"","description":"Ride aboard the Sky Whale Mount and patrol the sky-high seas of the Realm for loot and plunder!

Following the arrest of a prominent community leader, New York stands in disarray. Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as ‘Shard’ spreads throughout the underworld. With the city’s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city’s fate. Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to die… unless you decide they must. Key Features: Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it’s sneaking through levels or attacking head-on Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle A reactive story where the player’s choices have real consequences Stylized pixel art environments and characters Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley Gameplay: Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them. Tackle encounters in lethal, high-octane combat, or use your wits to stick to the shadows, utilizing distraction techniques and non-lethal attacks to reach your objective. Augmentation: Unlock cybernetic upgrades to augment your abilities via upgrade trees, and build upon your playstyle to improve your stealth or increase the lethality of attacks through talent trees. Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground. Reactive Story: Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld. Crush entire factions or convince them to aid your cause. Your destiny is yours to write. The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2520-CUSA23292_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"88%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP2520-CUSA23292_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","PlusPrice":53.88,"Popularity":"","Title":"Disjunction - Digital Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-27","Slug":"disjunction-digital-deluxe-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"449.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"53.88","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"/game/70006","description":"Are you ready for some throttle mashing, missile blasting, kart smashing fun?

You’re here to test our newest, state-of-the-art military-grade color-technology: The ChromaGun (patent pending)! Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. The ChromaGun Bundle includes ChromaGun and ChromaGun VR. PlayStation VR is required for ChromaGun VR. ChromaGun VR supports Aim Controller.

In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle.

When an agent of the B.P.R.D. goes missing, Hellboy is sent to investigate; pulling him into the depths of the Wyrd. Play the Comics Developed by Upstream Arcade, Hellboy Web of Wyrd utilizes an art style faithful to Mike Mignola’s original masterpieces. Like in the comics, the game sends Hellboy on a series of vastly different and wholly-unique adventures; and while each story stands on its own, they are all tied to the mysterious legacy of The Butterfly House. Welcome to the Wyrd Built in 1962 by occultist Pasquale Deneveaux, The Butterfly House is more than a mere residence; it’s a gateway. Built upon occult ley-energies, its strange angles and non-Euclidean geometries were designed with a singular foul purpose in mind: to open doorways into a terrible and fascinating dimension called The Wyrd. Roguelike Action Brawler Go toe-to-toe (or hoof-to-hoof) with a menagerie of nightmarish creatures and homunculi as you explore the realms within the Wyrd. Combat has been engineered to create challenging encounters that encourage you to learn patterns, dodge, parry, and - of course - punch your enemies into oblivion.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/0518/e24db8dea9de230abae2255babb2e39bb94d9d7ad5836a62.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8909-CUSA38012_00-0535385548057263","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action","id":"EP8909-CUSA38012_00-0535385548057263","PlusPrice":999999.0,"Title":"Hellboy Web of Wyrd","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Good Shepherd Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2023-10-18","Slug":"hellboy-web-of-wyrd-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":8,"SalePrice":"377.40","IsPS4":1,"Popularity":""}]
