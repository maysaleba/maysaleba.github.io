Along the way he\'ll need to befriend a hilarious cast of characters, convince the city its most beloved citizen is a terrifying criminal mastermind, and hardest of all, teach his daughter it isn\'t funny to fill the fridge with dog food.

The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Renovate and decorate train stations and trains. Detailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements. Build your own station. Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player\'s commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time.

It\u2019s just another wonderful day out with the kids in Think of the Children, a frantic parenting simulator for up to four players. Hauled before the court for bad parenting and endangering the lives of your children, the Prosecutors present a series of events as evidence that will either condemn or exonerate you: a birthday party at the park, a day at the zoo, a camping trip, an unexpected visit to the Australian Outback and more. Each of these locations proves to be far more dangerous than they sound, and even the tamest of environments are filled with deadly hazards. Run solo, or team up with other parents to play through each trip in flashback to prove your parenting skills-and your innocence-to the judge, and avoid going to jail. KEY FEATURES Multi-tasking mayhem: There\u2019s never a dull moment when you\u2019ve got the BBQ to tend, picnic tables to set, some of the kids are playing with a rabid dog, and two of them just ran out onto the road.

A young man is dazing off while working the night shift at a convenience store, when a girl stops in to ask for a meat bun. The one next to her appears to be her boyfriend, and after doing their shopping, the two of them link arms affectionately and take off. Just when the young man is thinking how nice it would be to have a girlfriend, a pair of girls in ninja cosplay show up. The girls just stare at the shop goods without buying anything in particular. Even worse, they\'re even chatting about ninja techniques or something along those lines. When he calls out to them to prevent theft, it becomes apparent that they have no money. Despite suspecting that they might try to steal something, he gives in and buys a bento for the two desperately pleading girls.

Barely.<br /><br />Take on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents.<br /><br />You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it\'s heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.<br /><br />During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands.<br /><br />If you\'re lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.<br /><br />You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode.<br /><br />Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you\'re wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.<br /><br />In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.<br /><br />If you can survive long enough to find it.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"NO MORE ROBOTS","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-30","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/2309/XEozUpmOCdLB940sqK9hCvS5.png?w=200","Slug":"nowhere-prophet-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4256-CUSA19107_00-NOWHEREPROPHETUS","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IadayVADjTw","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"40%","Price":24.99,"genre":"Role-Playing,Strategy","SalePrice":14.99,"PlusPrice":14.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"85","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/55163/resident-evil-village-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-03-03 07:59:00","Title":"Resident Evil Village","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-02-16 09:10:29","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.<br /><br />Experience survival horror like never before in the eighth major installment in the storied Resident Evil franchise - Resident Evil Village.<br /><br />Set a few years after the horrifying events in the critically acclaimed Resident Evil 7 biohazard, the all-new storyline begins with Ethan Winters and his wife Mia living peacefully in a new location, free from their past nightmares.

Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages.<br /><br />The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible.<br /><br />Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.<br /><br />As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent.

A fierce brawl commenced and Marty lost his right arm \u2013 but at least the demon also lost his head. Unfortunately, whilst the brawl erupted more demons entered his garage and stole his last batch of limited edition Walrus Ale (tm). Now Marty has become furious! He ripped off the demon\'s arm and did some DIY to re-attach his arm back to himself. This demon is no looker but gee it casts some nasty fireballs. Marty\'s (after)life now has a single purpose: Go to hell and get his beer back!  \\\\m/<br /><br />Remote Play","ESRBRating":"ESRB Mature","Publisher":"Headup Games GmbH & Co.

Sheltered is a world where death is permanent.<br /><br />Combat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you try to turn the cold and cramped Shelter into a home. And as they cling desperately to life, you must send family members from the scant protection of the shelter, outside into the dangerous, desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies. You\'ll come across abandoned towns, roaming factions and feral beasts.<br /><br />How you handle the many moral choices you\'ll encounter could be the difference between the family surviving or dying.

Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.<br /><br />As with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island.<br /><br />Nature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Merge Games Limited","ReleaseDate":"2019-07-30","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307q3DKnRbVRguZntUwA90V0Xpj_BaD9RmoQURl7fcykl0UpKC_E1_YhD3KvFezWNEO-4Q1VmsAp3I200JL3BlTWEUW2Hc.png?w=200","Slug":"solo-islands-of-the-heart-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1260-CUSA14666_00-SOLO000000000001","platform":"Playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"75%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Role-Playing,Platformer,Adventure","SalePrice":4.99,"PlusPrice":3.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-03-03 07:59:00","Title":"Sonic Colours: Ultimate - Digital Deluxe","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-02-16 09:10:17","description":"The evil Dr. Eggman has built an interstellar amusement park \u2013 but he\'s powering it with a captured alien race called \u201cWisps.\u201d Use Sonic\'s speed to free the Wisps and gain their amazing powers as you explore six unique worlds, filled with hurdles to overcome.
