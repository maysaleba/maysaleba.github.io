I love creating simple, fun and well designed games. My biggest inspirations are games from the 8-bit and 16-bit era.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player\'s score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"8.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"109","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.51","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-21","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-01","description":"Skee-Ball is officially licensed Skee-Ball arcade game.

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia. Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds. Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay.

Eighties of the twentieth century. The golden age of 8-bit video games. We were leaving school, and we were going to spend our precious coins in the arcade machines. One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari\'s Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t want to be better than Asteroids; that\'s impossible. What we want is to make a tribute. And that\'s all we want. We have added some aspects, besides the famous UFO: a demon, and some enemy ships that launch rockets to destroy us. Main features are: Features.

The World Large, procedurally generated and interconnected lands range from plains, to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area\u2019s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items. One must choose carefully though; every god has a different price and some become displeased when their rival is the subject of worship. Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians.

On a late-night highway drive, a quiet train car in the early hours, a walk through a moonlight park, or the endless wait in a deserted airport, we listen to weird music amid the ambient announcements of delays and question our place in the universe. Inspired by long travel and the stream of consciousness it fosters, Glitchhikers asks you to look inward. Find the answers to your questions and question the answers you receive. Ruminate on life, the universe, our place and purpose in it. Voyage through a freeform narrative experience, converse with the endless inevitability, and explore the cosmic, hopeful world you find yourself in. A follow up to the critically praised short game released in 2014, Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between is an expanded experience, reborn and reimagined.

Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of.<br /><br />Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night.<br /><br />Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness. The game\'s cutscenes, quirky cast of characters, and the majestic Pacific Northwest vistas have been enhanced for an experience that delivers as much on its visual impact as its unnerving atmosphere.","ESRBRating":"CERO Under Review","Publisher":"Epic Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-05","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202109/2709/wMyl8RQ9Tvi99wjgPPEBGVyX.png?w=200","Slug":"alan-wake-remastered-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1477-PPSA01924_00-AWREMASTERED0001","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRVBZC-RJF0","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"PercentOff":"25%","Price":29.99,"genre":"Action","SalePrice":22.49,"PlusPrice":22.49,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"81","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/151673/grow-song-of-the-evertree-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-04-28 06:59:00","Title":"Grow: Song of the Evertree","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-03-30 07:10:09","description":"Grow your own worlds!

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity.

In each loop you\'ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal.

You\'ll experience DEATHLOOP\'s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom.

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity.

It is a celebration of ancient China\'s landscape, civilization and culture, infused with the mystique of its own legends in stark contrast to anachronistic technological designs. It is a world that is both familiar and mysterious, one of both science and spirituality, one that is waiting to be explored.<br /><br />Take the role of the calm and reliable swordsman Taishi Zhao as he fights to protect his family and uncover the truth of a blight threatens all of China. With a story deeply rooted in ancient Chinese history and mythology, Xuan Yuan Sword 7 reimagines both as one fantastical and chaotic realm under the governance of a new Xin Dynasty.<br /><br />Near the end of Western Han rule, the powerful prime minister of China superseded his Emperor, promising an era of peace and prosperity. But ten years later, that promise has never been fulfilled. Instead, a decade of war and famine has left China in ruin, and its salvation seems to lie in the hands of a Mohist swordsman who gains control of a fabled artifact called the Elysium Scroll. Can the science-seeking Mohists revive their former glory, or will they fade into the pages of forgotten history?<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />\u2022 Journey across ancient China as a cinematic adventure unfolds.<br />\u2022 Slash, block, dodge and riposte in combo-based real-time combat!<br />\u2022 Control the Elysium Scroll to slow down time, absorb monsters or alter the environment.<br />\u2022 Upgrade armor and weapons, develop passive skills and learn new techniques.<br />\u2022 Explore a standalone story requiring no prior knowledge of Xuan Yuan.<br />\u2022 Immerse yourself in the most advanced 3D visuals in series history!<br /><br />Offline play enabled","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"EastAsiaSoft","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-30","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/0402/INUC5zBHwUsRYqcxfrRiPIKX.png?w=200","Slug":"xuan-yuan-sword-7-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2005-CUSA28396_00-XUANYUANSWORD007","platform":"Playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"30%","Price":49.99,"genre":"Role-Playing","SalePrice":34.99,"PlusPrice":34.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-14 06:59:00","Title":"Yakuza: Like a Dragon Legendary Hero Edition PS4 and PS5","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-03-30 07:10:24","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.<br /><br />Yakuza: Like a Dragon Legendary Hero Edition includes Job Set, Crafting Mat Set, Management Mode Set, Karaoke Set, Ultimate Costume Set, and Stat Boost Set DLC.<br /><br />RISE LIKE A DRAGON<br /><br />Ichiban Kasuga, a low-ranking grunt of a low-ranking yakuza family in Tokyo, faces an 18-year prison sentence after taking the fall for a crime he didn\'t commit.
