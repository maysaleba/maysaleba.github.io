The game takes inspiration from fast-paced top-down rogue-lites and adds free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent gameplay elements of immersive sims and RPGs. Rather than taking place in a dungeon, the game is set in a functioning, procedurally generated city, where complex AI informs denizens from all walks of life, who are just trying to get by in their daily activities. In order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through the use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.

Will you reach the center? And if so, what will you discover about yourself there, in the dark? There is but one enemy... But it is the unbeatable Minotaur. Only by exploring the maze of the Labyrinth can you hope to discover how to defeat this immortal monster. The great maze has many tools, many rewards, and many secrets just waiting for you to find them. But you can\u2019t waste your precious time, for the Minotaur is getting ever closer. Dark Flavour The game is inspired by the Greek myth of the labyrinth and the fight between Theseus and the Minotaur. The dark theme is visually expressed by retro pixel art, enriched by voice acting and metaphorical storytelling, creating (we hope) a thrilling atmosphere. The Labyrinth The journey has 6 chapters - each with its own specific challenges, patterns, and rewards. A total of 42 stages, 5 skill upgrades - each with 3 levels, 3 hidden upgrades, 2 unique upgrades, secret passages and Easter eggs. Fair Warning This game is not a rogue-like dungeon crawler, but rather an experience which will ultimately give you the answer to the question: dare you know yourself? Of course, you can simply see it as a guilty pleasure arcade game, just take note: permadeath is unforgiving.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Tauronos_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tauronos-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"0","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k3ZCIRbdYM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"8","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Simulation,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"5.40","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Tauronos.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"64.80","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/50543/tauronos-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"TAURONOS","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Restless Corp","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-03","Slug":"tauronos-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"14.40","ChilePrice":"","Price":"6.99","MexicoPrice":"81.36","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"4.19"},{"CanadaPrice":"11.09","SCORE":"70","SaleEnds":"2022-04-11","LowestPrice":"8.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-28","description":"Quest Hunter is an isometric action-RPG where your choice drives the story.

He is Adam, guilty of a great sin and drawn to this place by powers as secret as they are terrifying. As his home, the Kingdom of Cavanis, languishes in blasphemy, Adam must face a series of trials in a desperate quest for redemption.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_SinnerSacrificeForRedemption_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sinner-sacrifice-for-redemption-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"4.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS8fdfnjwqg","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":"9","genre":"Action,Fighting","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7.12","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_SinnerSacrificeForRedemption.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"62.25","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/54752/sinner-sacrifice-for-redemption-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"SINNER: Sacrifice for Redemption","ESRBRating":"Mature","Publisher":"Another Indie Studio","ReleaseDate":"2018-10-18","Slug":"sinner-sacrifice-for-redemption-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"19","ChilePrice":"","Price":"18.99","MexicoPrice":"92.10","MainExtra":"6","SalePrice":"4.74"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.49","SCORE":"60","SaleEnds":"2022-04-11","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-21","description":"Be smart and be fast to overcome the challenges of your journey.

Often outnumbered, what does a police officer feel like during the conflict? RIOT \u2013 Civil Unrest presents the player with the opportunity to experience both sides of the fight - a fight in which there really are no winners. Who is right and who is wrong?

Eighties of the twentieth century. The golden age of 8-bit video games. We were leaving school, and we were going to spend our precious coins in the arcade machines. One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari\'s Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t want to be better than Asteroids; that\'s impossible. What we want is to make a tribute. And that\'s all we want. We have added some aspects, besides the famous UFO: a demon, and some enemy ships that launch rockets to destroy us. Main features are: Features.

Best way to describe this game by phrase: \xabfantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles\xbb. Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way.

Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay You need to conquer a big portion of the initial area that you start the level. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield empties. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and required conquered area percentage for the victory. What happens when you pass a level? You see the related girl\'s photo and can continue with her story or unlock the next girl. How many girls and bosses? 8 girls, 24 bosses, 24 minions, 24 levels, 8 mega levels, 4 traps, 4 power-ups, and 2 towers! Evil towers of course. Each boss and his minions were uniquely designed.

Big Drunk Satanic Massacre is basically a shooter with strong RPG elements - not that rocket propelled gun, though. The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food caf\xe9, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging. The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects.

Discover a large, lively and freely-accessible US city and ensure the safety in your district. Record traffic accidents, search for stolen vehicles and arrest criminals. Support other police officers at traffic checkpoints, flag down speeders and write them up. Stop and check every citizen or car you want and enforce the law. Pay attention to fugitive suspects and chase them on foot or by car with lights flashing and sirens blaring. Investigate crime scenes, interrogate witnesses and search for evidence. Get behind the wheel of three realistically recreated police vehicles with functional cockpits and use the in-car-computer to identify wanted suspects and stolen vehicles. Start with a typical police sedan and change to an all-terrain SUV and a fast police muscle car while you progress in the game.

Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of.<br /><br />Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night.<br /><br />Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness. The game\'s cutscenes, quirky cast of characters, and the majestic Pacific Northwest vistas have been enhanced for an experience that delivers as much on its visual impact as its unnerving atmosphere.","ESRBRating":"CERO Under Review","Publisher":"Epic Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-05","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202109/2709/wMyl8RQ9Tvi99wjgPPEBGVyX.png?w=200","Slug":"alan-wake-remastered-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1477-PPSA01924_00-AWREMASTERED0001","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRVBZC-RJF0","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"PercentOff":"25%","Price":29.99,"genre":"Action","SalePrice":22.49,"PlusPrice":22.49,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"81","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/151673/grow-song-of-the-evertree-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-04-28 06:59:00","Title":"Grow: Song of the Evertree","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-03-30 07:10:09","description":"Grow your own worlds!

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity.

In each loop you\'ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal.

You\'ll experience DEATHLOOP\'s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom.

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity.

It is a celebration of ancient China\'s landscape, civilization and culture, infused with the mystique of its own legends in stark contrast to anachronistic technological designs. It is a world that is both familiar and mysterious, one of both science and spirituality, one that is waiting to be explored.<br /><br />Take the role of the calm and reliable swordsman Taishi Zhao as he fights to protect his family and uncover the truth of a blight threatens all of China. With a story deeply rooted in ancient Chinese history and mythology, Xuan Yuan Sword 7 reimagines both as one fantastical and chaotic realm under the governance of a new Xin Dynasty.<br /><br />Near the end of Western Han rule, the powerful prime minister of China superseded his Emperor, promising an era of peace and prosperity. But ten years later, that promise has never been fulfilled. Instead, a decade of war and famine has left China in ruin, and its salvation seems to lie in the hands of a Mohist swordsman who gains control of a fabled artifact called the Elysium Scroll. Can the science-seeking Mohists revive their former glory, or will they fade into the pages of forgotten history?<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />\u2022 Journey across ancient China as a cinematic adventure unfolds.<br />\u2022 Slash, block, dodge and riposte in combo-based real-time combat!<br />\u2022 Control the Elysium Scroll to slow down time, absorb monsters or alter the environment.<br />\u2022 Upgrade armor and weapons, develop passive skills and learn new techniques.<br />\u2022 Explore a standalone story requiring no prior knowledge of Xuan Yuan.<br />\u2022 Immerse yourself in the most advanced 3D visuals in series history!<br /><br />Offline play enabled","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"EastAsiaSoft","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-30","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/0402/INUC5zBHwUsRYqcxfrRiPIKX.png?w=200","Slug":"xuan-yuan-sword-7-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2005-CUSA28396_00-XUANYUANSWORD007","platform":"Playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"30%","Price":49.99,"genre":"Role-Playing","SalePrice":34.99,"PlusPrice":34.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-14 06:59:00","Title":"Yakuza: Like a Dragon Legendary Hero Edition PS4 and PS5","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-03-30 07:10:24","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.<br /><br />Yakuza: Like a Dragon Legendary Hero Edition includes Job Set, Crafting Mat Set, Management Mode Set, Karaoke Set, Ultimate Costume Set, and Stat Boost Set DLC.<br /><br />RISE LIKE A DRAGON<br /><br />Ichiban Kasuga, a low-ranking grunt of a low-ranking yakuza family in Tokyo, faces an 18-year prison sentence after taking the fall for a crime he didn\'t commit.
