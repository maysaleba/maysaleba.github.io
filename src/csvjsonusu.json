Experience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game's eponymous villain 'Hex'.

Players will explore five stylized worlds and experience up to 10 hours of epic adventure saving Pip\u2019s village from the evil Queen DeRezzia. Inspired by classic platformers, Adventures of Pip basks in a world where players can defeat a huge 32-bit boss as a single pixel or even as an 8-bit character.

It's time to relive the madness of GOING POSTAL! - Brand new Rampage mode: Take aim for the high score in this frantic mode that awards points for sustained kill streaks, creative methods of destruction, and blistering fast action! - Battle through 17 levels in the classic Campaign: Beginning from your humble Home, traverse through The Mine and Trailer Park, witness the mean streets of The Ghetto and the bright lights of The City, all the way to the final standoff at the Air Force Base, including a stop at the all-new Carnival. - Includes the original add-ons: Blast through Special Delivery's EZ Mart, Shanty Town, Earthquake, and the luxurious La Palamino Resort, and then head to Japan in Super POSTAL's Tokyo and Osaka! Play through everything together in the massive combined 23-level Excess Postage campaign! - A wide range of foes: Defend yourself against gun crazy Vigilantes, trigger-happy Police Officers, trained and efficient SWAT and Military squads, the quintessential Marching Band, and angry Ostriches! - 10 weapons of destruction: Lay waste with the mighty Shotgun and Spray Cannon, roast attackers with Molotovs and the Flamethrower, fill the streets with fire with the Napalm Launcher, clear out entire groups with Grenades and the Rocket Launcher (Heatseekers included!), lay traps for unsuspecting pursuers with varied types of Mines, and introducing the commanding Revolver! POSTAL Redux is a high definition remake of the classic dark and surreal twin-stick isometric shooter. Take control of The Postal Dude as he fights to survive in a world gone mad with violence.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-28","LowestPrice":"/game/37364","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/1511/kO6HU7hajK7iCTZlYLGvb0FD.png?w=200","MainStory":2,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6301-CUSA25566_00-2791104902411940","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2rxVhKKA9A","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":4,"genre":"Action, Shooter, Adult","PlusPrice":3.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/1511/kO6HU7hajK7iCTZlYLGvb0FD.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/postal-redux","Title":"POSTAL Redux","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"MD GAMES SP.

Each choice you make in the crucial few moments we all know may change our lives for good in a split of a second, influence what kind of person Mitch turns out to be and what values shall guide him once he becomes his own man. Why Are You Who You Are? Find clues as to why Louise\u2019s life is what it is today, take crucial decisions no other person would be strong enough to stomach and show Mitch what he needs to see in order for him to become independent, suave and brave enough to conquer the day. Everything Has Consequences Your decisions REALLY matter! To keep track of Mitch\u2019s growth as a person, each choice you make adds positive or negative points to three key statistics: Righteousness, Confidence, and Relations. These influence which type of ending Mitch will reach at the end of the game - there are 9 unique endings in total! Everybody Has Their Story The 1960s were tumultuous in more ways than one - the Summer of Love, the Vietnam War, the survivors and the losers of the great upheaval in history. Canned Heat was \u201cGoing Up the Country\u201d while Bob Dylan asked \u201cHow does it feel\u201d to have no home and live on the street.

It'll Be The Best Month Ever! is a complete collection of 29 beautiful, expressive, folk, country and jazz-inspired melodies prepared by the composer Jędrzej Bączyk (Pan Jędras).

Life in the Great Arknian Empire is harsh and its hardest Lot is yours by the circumstance of birth. You are a commoner, holding no rights and no title. To seize your fate and become the rightful heir to the legacy of the Brante family you will have to come to grips with ossified tradition and prejudice. Embarking on a life-long journey from one's birth until true death, you will have to endure great upheavals, face adversity, and make many difficult choices. Every decision will affect not only the protagonist, his family, and loved ones, but may even topple the foundation of the Empire itself. Key features At the turn of time Every imperial citizen's life is predetermined by their estate. The deities known as the Twin Gods have bestowed this truth to the world, dividing mortals into Lots.

Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to. Scale Massive Beasts ------------------------------- Overcome impossible odds to climb atop and defeat the massive beasts that are bound to this land. Climb, Glide, Swim ------------------------------- You can climb on virtually anything you can get your hands on, from ruins and mountains to the massive beasts that inhabit the land. Ascend to the tops of mountains and then glide over the open world to reach previously inaccessible locations. Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don't stay in too long or your swim could become your last. Explore, Craft, and Survive ------------------------------- You'll arrive on a frozen island with only the clothes on your back -- it's up to you to survive. Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn't the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait. Make Your Path ------------------------------- Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course. Unravel the Mystery ------------------------------- Why won't the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to. A Beautifully Frigid World ------------------------------- Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog.

To capture a creature, Sheepo must find their unhatched egg, which happen to be highly guarded by that species \"queen\" (aka, a boss.) With each egg Sheepo collects, you then gain the ability to transform into that creature on contact, and explore the deeper reaches of the planets sprawling environment Sheepo is a metroidvania, but contains no standard combat. Instead, gameplay is based on platforming and exploration. With the collection of each creature, Sheepo is able to dig, fly, and teleport across an interconnected series of landscapes, uncovering hidden shrines, old ruins, and strange characters. Features: -Tight platforming with variety. Play as both Sheepo, and the variety of creatures you come in contact with. Gameplay remains fresh as you consistently learn the moves of each creature -Traverse a sprawling landscape with tons of hidden rooms and characters. Explore old mines, an abandoned mall, lush forests, the dingy sewer system, and much more. -75+ hidden feathers to collect (the planets currency), which can be spent at the last remaining shop in DeadMall. -Non-linear gameplay. Sheepo begins somewhat linearly, but the map quickly opens up to allow you to make your own route.

Take the role of Ella, the Actress and through exploring an old theatre try to unveil secrets hidden in the extraordinary, magical plays created in the imagination of Mr. Chardish. NOSTALGIC JOURNEY TO THE PAST When they were young, the Actress and the Director were full of dreams and ambitions. Decades later, the Actress returns to the theatre, to once more become the performer, the audience and the muse. The performances, the letters and the radio interviews - they are all meaningful, but will the Actress find what she's looking for? Attend the last show of a famous artist reflecting on his defining moments and your role in his life. VARIETY IN ARTSTYLE AND GAMEPLAY With each play you will explore a new, incredible scenography, fully painted in VR. Each performance tells the story of different characters, with individual gameplay mechanics and a unique closure. Be a robot escaping a factory or a little, boastful musketeer - every role you take is a medium for emotional experiences of the Director. GRAPHICS MADE WITH VR TECHNOLOGIES To separate the performances from the real world and put the stress on their artistic nature, we decided to reach for new, creative methods of graphic design. The plays\u2019 segments of the game are painted using virtual reality technology. Exchanging traditional 3D modeling for painterly strokes and splatters granted us more expressive freedom in shaping the artistic vision of the Director.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-28","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0813/GZr3asWfXe4D76bkj0z7RI2u.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6502-CUSA28838_00-2734722164957168","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U8qalxJreI","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"","genre":"Adventure, Adventure, Adventure","PlusPrice":2.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0813/GZr3asWfXe4D76bkj0z7RI2u.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Last Show of Mr. Chardish","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Hydra Games S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-02","Slug":"the-last-show-of-mr-chardish-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":9.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":3.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-10-13","description":"Race your way up hill in this low-poly stylized 3d environment.

Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive? If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode! Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play. You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type. The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it.

The old man fell ill and he's now fighting for his life. Timothy, who loves his grandfather very much, decides to take a risky journey to the infamous Mysterious Forest. Legends speak of a magic mushroom able to cure any disease that grows into the forest. Timothy bravely begins his journey to find the magic mushroom. The game mixes elements from adventure/exploration games with puzzle and stealth: exploration, reading and keeping a slow pace is the best tactic. The high difficulty level is the base: Timothy is basically defenceless and dies with a single touch from enemies or traps. The world is full of ruins, graveyards and tombstones, caves, swamps and weird characters: every place is made to look wild, abandoned and dangerous.

Get ready to command an odd squad of fun birds and devise a plan to bring them safe and sound to the end of the battlefield. An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers. Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these \"flying soldiers\" can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these \"characters\", they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance. Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help. It's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-28","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/2017/xEklooqKV4sYz7liyfsMYa3b.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4035-CUSA20600_00-FLYINGAVATARBUND","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"73%","Completionist":"","genre":"Family, Puzzle, Unique","PlusPrice":3.95,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/2017/xEklooqKV4sYz7liyfsMYa3b.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Flying Soldiers (Game + Avatar Pack)","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Wild Sphere S.L.","ReleaseDate":"2020-12-10","Slug":"flying-soldiers-game--avatar-pack-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":17.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":4.85,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-10-13","description":"This pack includes the first two games of the Hammerwatch series, acclaimed by both players and the critics: Hammerwatch, a hack and slash action adventure, set in a beautiful fantasy pixel art environment where you can play solo or co-op.

You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.

Deliverance is poised upon three Dwarven astronauts who are sent on an expedition to find a new star in the depths of the Endless Stone. Take control of Forcer, Smashfist, and Shadow as they explore the unknown territories of the stone universe while meeting new civilizations and ancient monsters from the deep layers of space. We Are The Dwarves is an action-based tactical adventure with active pause (extreme slowdown of time) placing you in control of three Dwarven astronauts. Forcer is capable of ranged destruction, and timely set-up exectution. Smashfist, a brute at heart, gets up close and personal with rage worth avoiding. Shadow stays just where you'd expect him to, launching deadly successive assassinations and precision archery from afar. As a trio, combine each dwarfs attack styles into orchestrated destruction against your foe.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-28","LowestPrice":"/game/34949","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP2232/CUSA07911_00/Un9bpzeGM3chIw83VQA9hCk3bqoOJvXD.png?w=200","MainStory":9,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2232-CUSA07911_00-1597536644882270","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvE5uuCPzI0","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":16,"genre":"Action, Action, Action","PlusPrice":1.34,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP2232/CUSA07911_00/Un9bpzeGM3chIw83VQA9hCk3bqoOJvXD.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"We Are The Dwarves","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Whale Rock Games","ReleaseDate":"2017-03-21","Slug":"we-are-the-dwarves-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":8.99,"MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":2.24,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-10-13","description":"Now includes the 4v4 Ghost War PvP mode!

A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age. The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station Cities struggle for survival, both with each other and the mutant horrors that await outside. You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised underground. Having never ventured beyond the city limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat.
