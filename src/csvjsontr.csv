Embark on this definitive version of the critically acclaimed Shin Megami Tensei V, massively expanded with a brand-new storyline featuring new locations, demons, and choices to make that will dictate the fate of all existence. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance consists of two complete story paths: experience a brand-new route, the ""Canon of Vengeance"" – a dramatic tale of revenge by the fallen, centered around new characters and an enigmatic cohort of demons, the Qadištu, who plot their own dark designs apart from the war of those who fight to maintain order and those who seek to defy it. Or explore the original story told in Shin Megami Tensei V, the ""Canon of Creation"" – an eternal conflict between angels and demons, in which the protagonist fights for the world’s fate. When a grisly murder scene in modern-day Tokyo blocks our protagonist’s walk home, an unplanned detour leaves him buried and unconscious. He awakens in a new Tokyo, a wasteland ravaged by apocalypse now called Da’at… but before bloodthirsty demons can claim his life, a savior emerges, and the two of them unite to become a mighty being, neither human nor demon: a Nahobino. With newfound power, the protagonist ventures through Da'at, an enigmatic realm filled with mythical deities and demonic tyrants in constant conflict for survival. Searching for answers, the protagonist must forge his own path in a battle between angels and demons to dictate the fate of the world. KEY FEATURES The Definitive Version of Shin Megami Tensei V Fully evolved with stunning visuals for modern consoles, the dark lore, unnerving atmosphere, and beautiful and monstrous demons are back and better than ever. Massively expanded with new areas, demons, and music, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance features more accessible gameplay, an improved battle system, new demon experiences, and greater field exploration. A Tale of Vengeance or Creation Which path will you choose? Experience a brand-new tale of revenge by the fallen or the original story of Shin Megami Tensei V, both filled with conflicting and tragic choices, forcing you to confront which ideologies you are willing to fight for. As order and chaos crumble around you, forge your own path to dictate the fate of humanity. Explore a Post-Apocalyptic World Battle through a decimated Tokyo, reduced to an expansive wasteland and overrun by mythical demons.

"83","2025-01-29","MEET A NOT-SO-ORDINARY NUN INDIKA is a third-person, story-driven game set in a strange world where religious visions clash with harsh reality. It tells the story of a young nun who sets off on a journey of self-discovery with the most unusual, horn-headed companion by her side. On the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance—as she speaks with the devil himself. Indika’s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery. The world she discovers can only be described as a wild combination of comedy and tragedy straight out of the novels by Dostoyevski and Bulhakov. ENJOY AN INDIE GAME WHERE EVERYTHING GOES The subjects of religion and authority are prevalent throughout Indika’s journey and she’ll be faced with many questions along the way. Guide her to find the answers one by one before she can finish her life-defining odyssey. Odd Meter is a small, independent studio formerly based in Moscow and now operating out of Kazakhstan. Its members put aesthetics at the forefront and aren’t afraid to tread the fine line of ethical norms. Their game is a great testament to that, as INDIKA constitutes an open challenge to the industry's established approach to creating video games.","2025-01-14","/game/139446","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/1114/2ab11b93f3b922d21a0c77af4baf962952e4e4d4ac775641.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-PPSA16214_00-0000000000INDIKA","20%","5","Adventure","612.5","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/indika","INDIKA","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2024-05-17","indika-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","4","700.00","0","",

A bystander’s video footage of his attempt to flee the scene and subsequent apprehension is all over the news, and public outcry demands a maximum sentence. “Three days ago, a dead body was found in an abandoned building in Yokohama. Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room. His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder.

It is a story of simple emotions we all know so well and value more than sometimes we dare to admit: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Embark on the adventure of an extraordinary family of heroes. With the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil. But... it's not a story about saving the universe. It’s a story about a valiant family standing together while the world around them is being devoured by darkness. FEATURES: - rogue-lite with a strong storyline - 7 playable characters - local co-op - play as two Bergsons together against the Corruption! Additional controller required. (Online co-op to be added in the future) - emotional tale focused on a family of heroes - a diverse set of skills - passive and active items modifying each run - multiple dungeons set in different biomes - a rich world full of history and magic - Family Trials - a mode separate from the Main Story campaign, offering new systems, items, objectives, character builds, and more - all set in a series of completely randomized dungeons.","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/113077yhP2jst_06RqAwL9pLHcZrfAy42eFUx_o5X33fXy_EmK92mn4NiIVpYdgDgoecaTUSYfswiupZCJcjydU5egYr61f6.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA10646_00-CHILDRENOFMORTA0","70%","0","Action, Adventure","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/children-of-morta","Children of Morta","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2019-10-14","children-of-morta-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","769.00","0","230.70","1","",

Take your time, explore and soak up every word. Two extraordinary strangers Frank and Drake are two extraordinary strangers brought together by unknown forces in a conspiracy that threatens them both. Sharing the same apartment, though destined never to meet, they must work together to uncover the mystery shrouding both their existences. Frank is the super of a run-down apartment block in Oriole City, worried he is losing his mind and what little remains of his connection to the world around him. Drake is allergic to sunlight and operates by night. Both experience visions and have unanswered questions about their pasts. Could the answers they seek be in these mysterious experiences? Their split existence means they must communicate via sticky notes left around the apartment. Despite this separation they must forge a relationship, uncover the mystery and survive. One compelling conspiracy Play both characters alternately: Frank during the day, Drake at night. What choices they make will affect what the other can do in the future. Though they must work separately, their fates are intertwined and depend on the trust and friendship they forge together. The game is set in Oriole City, a richly detailed and beautifully illustrated setting, full of mystery, remarkable characters, and secrets to unearth. Frank and Drake must explore these surroundings, solve puzzles and discover clues that will help them find the answers they desperately seek, to their respective troubled pasts. What choices will you make? The mystery unfolds via a branching narrative, where the choices you make will have a profound impact on the events Frank and Drake experience.

Will you discover all the secrets hidden in the world? Frank and Drake employs a beautiful graphical style that represents the unnerving and dreamlike existence that both characters feel with the world around them. The rotoscoping style is a painstaking process of hand drawing frames over filmed footage. The uncanny result reflects Frank and Drake’s realities: two extraordinary characters trying to blend into an ordinary world.","2025-01-14","/game/92574","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2208/2083cfe9751446703e5158250d4caf57eb456fc4474696b9.png?w=200","2","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5438-PPSA09560_00-9082029541397054","50%","0","Adventure","224.5","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/frank-and-drake","Frank and Drake","TRD","Chorus Worldwide Games","2023-07-19","frank-and-drake-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","449.00","11","224.50","1","",

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You’re the perfect candidate for our test chambers!

After the animals of Torch City were defeated by the invading Robotic Legion in the Resistance War six years ago, former Resistance fighter Rayton the rabbit has kept a low profile.

"64","2025-01-29","Welcome to ChromaTec’s test lab! You’re here to test our newest, state-of-the-art military-grade color-technology: The ChromaGun (patent pending)! Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You’re the perfect candidate for our test chambers! That being said, welcome and good luck!

"","2025-01-29","Get ready to massacre monsters, race your rivals, and combat corpses of your fellow guards as you race to escape Black Iron Prison in the critically acclaimed roguelike, [REDACTED]. Black Iron, a state-of-the-art penitentiary located on Jupiter’s icy moon Callisto, is overrun with hordes of infected inmates. As a modest prison guard your job is simple – get to the last escape pod and get out alive! Fight through dozens of unique enemies and challenging environmental hazards as you battle your way out of the prison. But you aren’t the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals – a deranged custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more – can’t wait to step over your corpse and save themselves. Only one of you can make it off the moon – make sure it’s you! FIGHT/DIE/ADAPT Each death is a learning experience. Starting fresh each run, build up your loadout with powerful experiments, weapon schematics, and buffs to battle through Black Iron. When you die (and you will die), use your hard-earned loot to purchase new permanent weapons, suits, and skills. Get stronger, experiment with your strategy, and get out! ROUT YOUR RIVALS You're not the only person to survive the initial outbreak or willing to use a bit of violence to get to the last escape pod. Some prisoners and even your correctional services colleagues are just as eager to escape and will make escaping harder by attacking you remotely or challenging you to a one-on-one duel. Race them, attack them back remotely, and fight them to the death to make it out in one piece. FIGHT YOUR LAST CORPSE When you die, you leave more than a coverall-clad carcass. Defeat the reanimated corpse of the last guard to succumb to the prison’s dangers to earn a powerful experiment. But beware, it’s not going to be an easy fight. The semi-alive guard has the same loadout they had when they met an untimely end and a few extra tricks up its sleeve to keep things spicy. DO OR DIE You’ve made the perfect build, battled through bosses, ran through rivals, killed your corpse, found all the files, and now you’re standing in front of that last escape pod.

"","2025-01-29","Sam is a six-foot canine detective with a nose for justice. Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they’re the Freelance Police—an irreverent comedy duo whose esoteric crime-fighting style has been entertaining comic book and video game fans for more than thirty five years. In 2006–2010, Sam & Max starred in a series of episodic adventures created by Telltale Games. Now you can play their first three seasons (Sixteen episodes altogether!) in these remastered versions, which have been lovingly updated with gorgeous HD graphics, overhauled lighting and lip-sync, finessed cinematography, remastered audio, and several all-new musical tracks featuring live jazz musicians. SAM & MAX SAVE THE WORLD It's just another day at the office when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam & Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the ""spinny thing"" they do with their eyes.) Who's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds. SAM & MAX: BEYOND TIME AND SPACE The Freelance Police are back on the crime beat in a showdown with Santa Claus, a race to subdue a giant volcano, and a face-off with a Eurotrash vampire… and then things get even weirder. Is paranoid shopkeeper Bosco on to something with his talk of a grand conspiracy? Is diner proprietress Stinky hiding the truth about what happened to her grandfather (also named Stinky)? Will flaky neighbor Sybil Pandemik ever find true love? Did someone say… BIRTHDAY?! Zombies will dance. Mariachis will sing. A giant battle robot will trash the streets. And when their friends’ lives are on the line, Sam & Max will risk their very souls to set things right. SAM & MAX: THE DEVIL’S PLAYHOUSE Max has always been the more unhinged member of the Freelance Police—a lovable lunatic with a knack for spreading chaos wherever he goes. But recently his abilities have taken a supernatural turn. It all started when he stumbled upon a mysterious toy that allows him to glimpse the future. Now Sam & Max have aroused the attention of a host of villains from across the galaxy who are hellbent on acquiring the magical Toys of Power to achieve their own ends. As those who seek the Devil’s Toybox close in and Max’s psychic abilities grow beyond his control, the Freelance Police will come up against their most frightening adversary yet: the power of Max’s mind.","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202408/1320/d1922b444c7829806548783854e99e0bccb903191b81158e.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5966-CUSA30836_00-0151809990428702","30%","0","Adventure","1224.3","null","null","Sam & Max: The Complete Trilogy","TRD","SKUNKAPE GAMES","2024-08-14","sam-max-the-complete-trilogy-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1749.00","0","1224.30","1","",

"","2025-01-29","Thief Simulator 2 will transport you to a world full of valuables, expensive cars, and rustling banknotes. As long as you find a way to steal them. Know that a thief’s trade is not a piece of cake. In order to get some practice, you’ll start with petty theft. This is how you’ll gain the experience required to access more and more risky – and most importantly, more profitable – jobs. Gain levels and unlock new possibilities. Get useful tools. Together with newly acquired skills, they will pave the way to expensive items, which you can then sell on the black market. The tools of your trade include a crowbar and binoculars, as well as advanced equipment that becomes available as you progress, such as a laptop for hacking through security systems. The creators of Thief Simulator 2 have prepared two unique locations with houses, banks, restaurants, and other special places that you’ll get to strip of money, valuables, and other items. But before you do, examine the surroundings: find out when the building empties out, learn the tenants’ or the employees’ schedule. Then you just need to prepare a strategy and it’s gone time. Just be quick and efficient. You don’t have much time, so you’ll need to immediately assess which item to take and which one to leave. Can you handle the pressure, or will you panic? Make sure to work on cars between robbing buildings. Start with small family sedans and make gradual steps towards mastery, which will allow you to steal the coolest sports cars. Remember to keep your eyes around your head. Even the best plan can fall apart, and the local police are just waiting for a chance to put you in handcuffs. Don’t get caught. Always be one step ahead of law enforcement. Feature list: -Two neighbourhoods, with over 20 houses to break into. Learn tenant's routines, pick the right time to break in, and then rob them -Three heists, each with a unique location. Make your way into a resort with 6 houses full of loot, a warehouse crawling with guards, and a central bank with gold waiting to be snatched from the vault. -Get better and better tools, ranging from a crowbar or binoculars to hacking laptops, stethoscopes, etc. -Make your way into houses undetected, or run in welding a baton and knock everyone out. Alternatively, put them to sleep using sleeping gas or a tranquilizer gun. The choice is up to you. -Payphone missions - rob certain locations in a specified amount of time -Over 15 contracts requiring you to steal unique items -Level up your thief and acquire new skills, which allow a number of new possibilities. Learn special skills, and activate unique abilities. -Escape the police - intense chases with police cars and helicopters. Be careful to not get shot. -Upgrade your car, change its color, give it more power - or just buy a sports car and be no match for the police. -Steal cars - begin with a small, family sedan, and work your way up to a sport's dream car","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202404/2613/126f315a1948c131d9d417cf28e17bf831d92d6295cf0af5.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5987-PPSA21997_00-0261948773137492","35%","0","Simulation","419.4","null","null","Thief Simulator 2","TRD","ULTIMATE GAMES","2024-07-12","thief-simulator-2-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","454.35","0","",

"","2025-01-29","Before you say ""Oh here's another Battle Royal game"" Let me tell you FWTF aka Fun with the Fitzgerald's it's what it says in the title it's all just about the fun. My six-year-old Daughter is a massive gamer just like I was at her age but most of the more suitable popular titles were just too difficult for her. So we teamed up to create a simple yet fun Battle royal game that can be enjoyed by all ages. The Fitzgerald's family is a fun loving bunch. Drop into the land where you will find a cool array of weapons to knock out your opponents with. From small snowball guns to epic ice blasters or electric zappers, rocket launchers, slime bomb guns, and paintball guns there are so many fun ways to play be sure to grab a cake or two and splatter your opponents right in the face. Pick up and eat beans to land smelly pumps. For quick getaways get your hands on a jetpack to fly away if you're finding yourself in trouble. The battle is played out on the Fitzgerald land and there can be only one king or queen of the land. There are handy level shops around the land to buy your favourite weapons by simply collecting as many coins and diamonds from the wide range of chests scattered around the land and if you are lucky enough to pick up some x-ray glasses you can seek out your opponents much easier. The safe zone will shrink in fast making matches quick and fun. Oh by the way watch out for Bruce the zombie and the ghost of posh aunt's mansion they think they own the Fitzgerald's land too. So come on and join in on the fun.","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/0710/c03f8d287507292078f4da8cf644f135dc30e95d8f74af21.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/UP6259-CUSA45888_00-0199601264012877","50%","0","Shooter","61.25","null","null","Fun with the Fitzgeralds","TRD","Joanne Hamer","2024-05-10","fun-with-the-fitzgeralds-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","245.00","0","122.50","1","",

The players will have to crack some grim criminal cases by exploring the world around them, rediscover the mysterious identity of the protagonist, cross the borders of inherent dangers and formal logic and create their own vision of time and history. BECOME A MYSTERY HUNTER A true hunter always trusts their gut instincts. They see moments of doubt as a waste of time as the path to the truth lies clear before their mind’s eye. It’s an intricate network of barely visible strings and links between other people’s secrets, mysteries and motives… You just have to pull the right string which will lead you to the solution. Become a hunter whose primary weapons are his mind and heart. COMPOSE YOUR VISION OF THE WORLD FROM BITS OF INFORMATION The main feature of this game is the unusual mix of sci-fi, social fiction, detective and horror. Each genre presents a unique story; the players may freely combine fragments of information from them all to create their own versions of this world, its history and the causes of main events. The identity of the protagonist is a mystery itself, and you’ll have to approach the storyline like a puzzle to solve it. FOLLOW THE STORIES OF THOSE WHO GOT LOST IN THIS LABYRINTH BEFORE Each and every person who had passed through this world before the protagonist came had their own vision of what was going on. Each and every one of them left some clues.

"","2025-01-29","""Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined,"" wrote Albert Camus, and it is hard to disagree with this. To contemplate one's life means to knock oneself down, to stop, to begin to go over one's experiences, to discard the superfluous and unnecessary, to destroy the old in the hope of constructing the new, in other words, to be undermined. It is impossible not to note the severity of this word because this action is associated with pain, loss, the need to choose difficult routes, and sometimes taking risks so as not to make new mistakes and not to fall off the set path. But is it worth enduring the pain? What happens if we simply go with the flow? How will our lives turn out then? The French philosopher Albert Camus asked similar questions in his famous essay ""The Myth of Sisyphus. In brief, the ancient Greek myth is as follows: the gods condemned Sisyphus, because he was too arrogant and too dodgy, to roll a huge stone up the mountain, which kept falling and had to start all over again. It would seem that what could be worse than this useless work? What was Sisyphus thinking as he climbed to the top of the mountain? And what do we care about him? Maybe we should admit that our lives are a bit like this Sisyphus? Approach Albert Camus's thoughts and feelings, his philosophy. Perhaps you will find some answers to these difficult questions. • Explore the world around you and find philosophical notes. • Take the stone to the top, higher and higher, and if it falls, well, start over, that's your punishment. • Choose your path correctly. Your decisions will determine the end of the game. • Discover the philosophy of Albert Camus. Don't try to understand every word, just let it pass through you. • Enjoy the abstract game world, and find different ways of passing. • And also listen to atmospheric music and sound effects.","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/1720/2ec7923b93669974f8483c69eb15b79f726c80c93b2ed5f8.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2029-CUSA44262_00-0936199158514762","80%","0","Adventure","52.35","null","null","Heavy Burden","TRD","Whale Rock Games OOO","2024-01-23","heavy-burden-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","69.80","1","",

"","2025-01-29","It’s time to leave big-city life in Pokyo behind and start a new chapter of your life on Coral Island! Be who you want and create the idyllic farm of your dreams, where you’ll tend crops, nurture animals, and build a bond with the natural world around you. Help revitalize the nearby town and its surrounding coral reefs, and forge relationships with a vibrant community of more than 70 fellow people who call Coral Island home. Farm. Decorate. Craft. Explore. Relax. Your future—and the future of Coral Island—is what you make of it. BUILD YOUR DREAM FARM Transform your overrun land on Coral Island into a lush and lively dreamscape—you decide what to build, what crops to grow, and which animals you’d like to tend. WRITE YOUR OWN STORY The story changes with each season, but life goes with the flow. Spend your days exploring, or build a life with someone special. Save the seas, brave the caves, or focus on your farm. It’s up to you! BE YOURSELF Choose from a wide variety of outfits, accessories, and physiques—you’ll find plenty of options to express yourself, find your style, and be whoever you want to be. BEFRIEND A DIVERSE CAST OF ISLANDERS Get to know the 70+ characters from all walks of life who live on Coral Island. Converse with them, find out more about their interests, and try to impress them with just the right gift. FIND THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE Meet 25 singles who are ready to mingle! Build relationships, sweep them off their feet, and find the one—and when you’re ready, embark on a new chapter of your story together at the farm. RESTORE AN ISLAND ONCE PARADISE Make Coral Island a better place for everyone! Liven up the town with community projects, expand the local museum, and restore heritage sites. Increase the town's rank and your community will thrive! CATCH OF THE DAY Island living has a lot of perks, including being just a stone's throw away from fun activities like hunting for insects and catching fish. DIVE THE OCEAN & MINE THE CAVERNS Go diving to restore the coral reef, or mine precious gemstones in the cavern. Whatever you decide to do, you’ll find loot to hone your tools and upgrade the quality of your livestock and crops.","2025-01-14","/game/92087","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/3018/578c25e83d7fe754a625ae6910d84e4ce12d420f9771beb1.png?w=200","52","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3717-PPSA17226_00-CORALISLANDPS5EU","30%","138","Adventure","734.3","null","null","Coral Island","TRD","Humble Games","2023-11-14","coral-island-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","91","734.30","0","",

Villagers cry out for a hero, help them to rise up against the forces of this feared villain. Construct buildings to strengthen your village, train your army and equip your allies. Look for key-assistance in other villages, such as dwarves, amazons, and witches. With their help and the strengthening of your army, lead missions, defeat the invaders and make the region a safe place again. We are stronger together! Unlike regular Tower Defense games, Warstone TD has a unique method of summoning defenders (towers represented by player’s allies and army). You start a mission with a fairly empty map and a few stones where you can place defenders. As the level progresses, more stones appear and some even drop from enemies, allowing you to place them in any valid position on the map. Powerful warstones also occasionally appear, which give significant bonuses to specific defenders when placed on them. You can summon any of the basic army classes on the stones. Each class has its own specialization path, damage type, gold cost, and special abilities. With such a variety of defenders and game classes there is a huge amount of tactics , increasing replayability even further! This is Warstone TD Gold Edition, a rare jewel of the game that will take you through the complete experience, including the Astral Voyage expansion with new battles and challenging enemies in even harder modes.

Colossal capital and cutting-edge technology was poured into rebuilding it. Skyscrapers that put the old high-rises to shame along with the world's biggest shopping mall and recreational facilities. This was the dazzling birth of a symbol for the new century. It was christened Zone Prime. And now, in an undeveloped sector of its western block, there was an area known as the slums... - Additional Characters: ・Greed A survivor of the illegal fighting organization ""Valor"".

"","2025-01-29","Tilting Tiles: Micro Challenge is the third installment in the Tilting Tiles series. Micro Challenge brings an entire new take on the unique puzzle series by adding new player movement options and new terrain tiles. Whether you are a fan of the series or a first time player, this is the perfect place to start. Micro Challenge is a uniquely set up movement based puzzle game, and your goal is to examine each level and determine the most efficient route possible to collect all items before reaching the move limit. Like in previous entries your Player Tile can Move, Double Slide, Diagonal Slide, Tilt, and Teleport. Micro Challenge also adds the ability to change sizes. Shrink your tile down to fit through narrow hallways and corridors. Be careful when you are small as there are now towers filled with holes, and if you try to traverse them while in the shrunken state, you will fall to your demise! It costs 1 energy unit to shrink or to grow. This creates an entire new style of puzzle design in which you must determine when it's most beneficial to change sizes in your route planning. Micro Challenge features the ability for the Tile to become ""micro"" but it is ALSO a ""micro"" sized Tilting Tiles game. Micro Challenge is designed to be a perfect starting point for the franchise. It features 20 unique levels and 5 creative multiplayer maps! Not only does Micro Challenge feature a focused and unique single player puzzle set, it also contains a series first, with the all new Tilting Tiles Multiplayer Mode. Grab a friend and solve your way through Tilting Tiles Maps together. Both players share a move count, so you must examine the level together and determine who can collect which items more efficiently. Each player is given a different set of problems to solve as well as a different amount of special moves available. The unique movement based puzzle experience returns with Tilting Tiles: Micro Challenge. Tilt and shrink alone or with a friend, can you guide the tile to victory?","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1019/48649a4aa144b5b19a37d79e7d744d6671bf089fc05a5f7d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5133-CUSA43364_00-MICROTILTCHALLEN","40%","0","Puzzle, Unique, Casual","10.5","null","null","Tilting Tiles: Micro Challenge","TRD","TreeFall Studios L.L.C.","2023-05-22","tilting-tiles-micro-challenge-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","21.00","0","12.60","1","",

"","2025-01-29","This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game. It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.

"","2025-01-29","Across the Valley is your friendly farm simulator, developed exclusively for VR. Lend a hand — literally — so that everything can grow and thrive. Sow, water and harvest your own plants. Raise adorable baby animals. Milk the cows, shear the sheep and go on a truffle hunt with the pigs — all in fun mini- and micro-games. The graphics in Across the Valley have a fantastic hand-drawn style. The grass here is lush and green, and the sunsets are golden. Enjoy the idyllic countryside and relax to the sounds of the atmospheric soundtrack. On your farm, there’s something to do every day. Give your plants and animals plenty of love and care! They’ll reward you with a bountiful harvest. You can use your profits to expand your farm — your planning table will let you see it all easily. Features: Action Point Locomotion System: * No Motion Sickness! With the action point locomotion system, no artificial movement is done! * Each action point is designed carefully to have everything you need within the reach of your hands. * Like: Everything you need to shear a sheep is right at the shearing station within your hand’s reach. * Or: Everything you need to work on the fields is at the tool spot. All tools are in reach of your hands. * You can get to an action point with just a blink of an eye. No button learning: * Do everything with your own hands. No extensive button learning is needed. * To dig up a field, take a shovel with you and grab it with two hands. Then dig the field up like you would in the real world. * To sow out seeds, just grab a seed bowl, grab some seeds from it and throw them on the field. Automatic Micro Games: * Instead of typical minigames that interrupt the game, Across the Valley automatically starts and stops a microgame when you perform an action. * An example: Sowing out seeds will automatically start a “seeding” micro-game when the first seed hits the field. The better you distribute the seeds, the more plants grow. Once the seed basket is empty, the microgame finishes and your plants start growing. Stay busy: * 36 tasks (quests) guide you from the basics of seeding to going on a truffle hunt with your pigs. * Infinite orders keep you busy, even after the main game. Cozy mood: * Carefully composed art style that lets you enter a comic-style world. * A well balanced mix of hand-drawn 4k textures and programmed effects create the illusion of a hand-drawn VR world. * Relaxing, exclusive soundtrack that puts you in the right mood. * Upgrade your house to make it look nice and cozy. Until now, you’ve only played farm simulators — but now you can move into your own virtual farm.","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202307/2514/b3a4deb6448c50cab178e4b2388716fbb5ce5957d31347cd.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7208-PPSA13759_00-0692696073114817","65%","0","Family, Casual, Simulation","174.75","null","null","Across the Valley","TRD","FusionPlay GmbH","2023-04-05","across-the-valley-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","244.65","0","",

All organized groups use various gadgets and global network to defend themselves and attack their rivals. Drones of different sizes and outfits often come to play when it's too risky to handle business in person. Lethal machinery of all kinds serve to those who know cyber security protocols better and have more resources at their disposal. You are Titanium Hound pilot and a kind of cop who wants to protect and serve, helping commoners who were unlucky to get in the middle of gang wars. Abominations, hacked drones and crazed gangsters are just the tip of the iceberg you are trying to break down without full understanding the scope of the problem. You are prepared much better than any regular police unit, but even so your hands are often tied, especially when it comes to questioning corporate regulations.","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202212/0418/Uy78nHtP0vob2PN1VX1PKHwL.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6606-CUSA40183_00-0876627551357161","60%","0","Action","157.5","null","null","Titanium Hound","TRD","Dmitrii Milovidov trading as OverGamez","2023-03-10","titanium-hound-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","0","210.00","1","",

You have to perform increasingly complex tasks in prison, balancing the administration's assessment and inmates' satisfaction. In the game, you play the role of a prison guard and it is only up to you whether you decide to obey the law or let this place and people corrupt you completely. After all, who said you had to be an exemplary ranger? Maybe you prefer to trade with prisoners, help them smuggle, and bet on the outcome of fights in prison instead? After all, everyone likes to have fun sometimes. Especially in a sad place like this, where you are also the boss. Or at least you think so. So how? Will you choose to follow the rules, intercept contraband, count prisoners, send them to work, take care of their basic needs and keep prison gangs under control? Will you go to the dark side? Whatever you decide, remember that your actions will affect both the facility itself and the inmates, and above all, the further course of your career. Unique features of the game: - try to balance between following the orders of your superiors and doing small favors for the inmates. In doing so, you will maintain a fragile balance between both and benefit from the gratitude of both parties, - become the exemplary prison guard in campaign mode. Receive new prisoners, search cells for contraband for confiscation, view surveillance footage, maintain peace and order, react to inmates' acts of disobedience, and complete many other tasks assigned by your superiors, - or ignore all rules in Free Play mode. Do what you want, discover the farthest corners of the prison, explore the surroundings and interact with prisoners. Just remember that your every action will have an impact not only on other prison guards but also on the inmates themselves. Especially if you choose to punish the latter frequently and for no apparent reason.","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/2414/RtjAgzTaTOQtewsEl4fj9MTG.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1549-CUSA37735_00-CLABS1PS20221231","55%","0","Action, Role Playing Games, Simulator","244.65","null","null","Prison Simulator","TRD","PlayWay plc","2023-02-03","prison-simulator-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","314.55","1","",

A HEART-POUNDING THRILLER Hazel Iversen, the Swan, is the new Prince of the Boston Camarilla.

"","2025-01-29","Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again is a dynamic platformer with the elements of a rogue-lite, a combo system and special moves. The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won’t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King’s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter’s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King’s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose. • The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty. As you progress, you'll come across Easter eggs, things that’ll crack you up and allusions to other games coupled with self-mockery • Randomly generated locations of items, artifacts, traps, rooms in the building, enemies and bosses • 12 characters, all with different performance and equipment • Customized equipment which can be upgraded with rocks, runes and enchantments • Secret features and tricks (e.g. get a firesword by plunging your sword into the lava) • Jaw-dropping action with various moves, skills and spells!","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/1314/p9Xoj3zDWsHsxVd3qyJsR5SE.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5506-CUSA29830_00-PLPA000000000000","69%","0","Role Playing Games, Action","25.12","null","null","Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again","TRD","BIG WAY LLC","2021-10-26","princesslootpixelagain-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","157.00","0","48.67","1","",

Most of the robotic units are controlled by the virus. Lead a squad of 4 prototypes on a mission to defend complex mainframe. You'll have to repel assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and do more on your way to the deepest parts of the complex. Work with item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and return fire.

Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies.

How may she perceive the twisted and manipulative family dynamics? Grow up with Lydia and try to understand the feelings, behaviours and events that moulded critical moments of her life. Confront the monster with your own sensitivity. This hand-drawn game can be completed in around one hour. The emotional music was composed by renowned film composer Juhana Lehtiniemi.

"","2025-01-29","Ai is a grade-schooler in 1990s Japan who is about to realise just how isolated she is. Forced to play children’s games in a world of never-ending dusk, Ai is hunted by otherworldly entities as her life hangs in the balance. When these horrors begin to bleed into the real world, Ai must accept that she has only three choices: hide, run, or die. ◆Evolving gameplay Test your courage in a dangerous game of hide and seek before initiating a terrifyingly twisted version of tag with abominations not of this world. Use the items you’ve gathered to flee your sunset hell, but be sure to remember the paths you’ve taken or risk being trapped there forever. ◆Japanese locations ablaze with a haunting, beautiful sunset Experience an unnerving mix of beauty, fear and nostalgia in a mysterious world where a Japanese house, school and hospital are all inexplicably connected. Explore corridors dyed twilight crimson, witness the ethereal glow of -amber through paper walls of a traditional Japanese house and escape creeping black shadows in hospital rooms where the power is somehow always out. ◆Hide or die 10-year-old Ai has no defensive measures to defeat the enemies you face; instead, you must take advantage of each spirit’s weaknesses to survive. Hold your breath to sneak past blind foes or dash past deaf ones as quick as your little legs can carry you. And if you can’t get away in time, prepare to suffer a dire fate at the hands of unimaginable forces. ◆A tragic tale of friendship, betrayal and facing your demons Mute and anxious, Ai is grateful when she makes a group of friends to play with. But it turns out that the ghostly apparitions trapped in the world of dusk aren't the only things she has to contend with; ghosts can be cruel, but children even more so. Your classmates harbour dark thoughts and harrowing secrets that you must uncover to progress. Throughout the game, Ai will learn more about her new friends than perhaps she'd care to know... ◆If only there were another way… Upon clearing the game, another ending will become available to you. What story will this new path unveil? Slipping back into the terrifying world of Yuoni will see you face considerably more challenging foes for an even greater reward.","2025-01-14","/game/97173","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/1901/3dX5u5FMCL78N4VpYUXkQPfD.png?w=200","3","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5438-PPSA02512_00-CHOR000000020DEU","70%","0","Adventure, Horror","199.5","null","null","Yuoni","TRD","Chorus Worldwide Games","2021-08-18","yuoni-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","665.00","4","199.50","1","",

"","2025-01-29","You find yourself in a room with no exits. Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive? If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode! Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play. You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type. The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it. Get your name up there and challenge your friends! The only question that remains is: what's outside the room?","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/2621/sLYBDX5lEZd62ey7pktpuHkZ.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5372-CUSA25597_00-3737254418184172","30%","0","Puzzle","125.4","null","null","Boxed In","TRD","RED CHAIN GAMES LTD","2021-05-27","boxed-in-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","209.00","0","146.30","1","",

The rules are simple - push a block in any direction, and it'll keep going until it hits a wall or another block. If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage! Enter the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire. Eons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia.

Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. If you can survive long enough to find it.","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/2309/XEozUpmOCdLB940sqK9hCvS5.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3999-CUSA19091_00-NOWHEREPROPHETEU","80%","0","Strategy","153.8","null","null","Nowhere Prophet","TRD","NO MORE ROBOTS","2020-07-30","nowhere-prophet-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","769.00","0","153.80","1","",

"","2025-01-29","PLAY FROSTPUNK: CONSOLE EDITION This version of the award-winning game from 11 bit studios is tailored to give console players the full Frostpunk experience: • Thanks to the special, dedicated controller scheme all important features of the game are quickly within your reach. • The Console Edition of the game already includes all the updates that have been released since its premiere on PC. THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.","2025-01-14","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000","80%","0","Strategy, Simulation, Strategy","0","null","null","Frostpunk: Console Edition","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2019-10-10","frostpunk-console-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","209.80","1","",

But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.

Deep in a forgotten forest, video blogger Katherine Patterson discovers an abandoned mansion, filled with strange machines and disturbing experiments. This is the home of Dr. Lawrence Talbot, who was reported missing more than 64 years ago. Patterson realizes this could be worth millions, the story of her career. But when she meets Dr. Talbot in person -- alive, trapped in a strange new dimension, and missing his body -- Patterson realizes she was wrong. This is the story of a lifetime. Torn opens as a narrative puzzle game, then evolves into a dark, character-driven story as you slowly uncover the truth about Talbot, and the new dimension he calls “The Parallel.” Remember everything you see, for in Talbot’s world, truth is nothing more than the invention of the mind. 1 player 6GB minimum save size HD Video Output 720p,1080p PlayStation®Move motion controller and PlayStation®Camera required.
