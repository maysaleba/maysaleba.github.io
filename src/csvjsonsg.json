In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-11","LowestPrice":"/game/68258","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","MainStory":15,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP1003-PPSA02532_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":34,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/deathloop","Title":"DEATHLOOP (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-13","Slug":"deathloop-simplified-chinese-english-korean-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":84.9,"MainExtra":22,"SalePrice":33.96,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"88","SaleEnds":"2022-10-26","description":"Reprise your role as a supernatural assassin in Dishonored 2 \u2013 the next chapter in the award-winning Dishonored saga by Arkane Studios.

The group is composed of very different personalities. Working together as a team seems impossible at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons.

Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You\u2019ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\u2019ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows? Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\u2019ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet.

Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You\u2019ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\u2019ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows? Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\u2019ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You\u2019ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it. Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead.

The powers of the Remnants slowly began to change the world's balance. A rift slowly formed between those who ruled and those who obeyed. This was the dawning of a new era \u2014 an era of countless frays that would be brought upon the world by those enslaved by their own lust for power. A thousand years later, the journey of one young man begins. ■Unique Battle System Battle commands for ever changing battle situations.

We celebrate the lives we've been given, and offer up prayers for the next. It is grief of death which shackles the living, and causes the dead to stray. Indeed, there is no greater affront to reincarnation. So we turn our grief to joy as we send the dead off with smiles. But the souls of those who held back their tears in life still need salvation in death. A duty that falls to the Watchers. Their task is to guide the wandering souls known as the Lost, and serve as keepers of the Living World and the Beyond. The Watchers sever the bonds that tie the Lost to this world, and send them on to the next. They navigate the emotions of the living and the dead. They prize life above all else. This is the story of one Watcher. ◆Features The player takes the role of Kagachi, a Watcher, as he travels between the Living World, the world of the living, and the Beyond, the world of the dead, saving the Lost. To fulfill his duty as a Watcher, Kagachi (the player) battles monsters by allowing Daemons to possess him, giving him access to a variety of job skills and abilities. Kagachi can bind up to four Daemons at the same time and switch between them in real time during combat with one simple press of a button. Each Daemon has a distinctive set of skills, a unique weapon such as a katana, spear, axe or scythe, and a different play style. Switch Daemons in and out of combat strategically to gain an advantage over your foes. ONINAKI has a weapon and Daemon customization system inspired by hack-and-slash games and an incredible amount of replay value.

Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages. The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible. Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences. As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain. A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's atmosphere.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-18","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/1308/IcgCV6RNmA3I0BUG4vIhQJca.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/JP1201-CUSA27899_00-SONGOFHORROR0003","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDAkLOhQZsM","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Adventure, Horror","PlusPrice":32.94,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/1308/IcgCV6RNmA3I0BUG4vIhQJca.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/song-of-horror","Title":"SONG OF HORROR (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"EXNOA LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-08-25","Slug":"song-of-horror-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":54.9,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":32.94,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"67","SaleEnds":"2022-11-02","description":"Spirit of the North is a single-player 3rd-person adventure game inspired by the breathtaking and mysterious landscapes of Iceland.

It's like a human's essence that can\u2019t be measured by a staged photo. And thus Glittering Sword is not that kind of game that some may think judging by screenshots or trailer. On the first glance it looks like typical action-adventure, like many other classic titles from the 90's. Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it\u2019s shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: «fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher. We hope that players who are addicted to adventure games will fall in love with this small but very entertaining game.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-18","LowestPrice":"/game/98018","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/0517/xwozsdQiItXnb99GL6CpCKpO.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP6533-CUSA32988_00-7133908941822682","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":3,"genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":2.76,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/0517/xwozsdQiItXnb99GL6CpCKpO.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Glittering Sword (English)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"CHILIDOG INTERACTIVE LLC","ReleaseDate":"2022-04-07","Slug":"glittering-sword-english-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":6.9,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":3.45,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-02","description":"THE NEXT CHAPTER IN FEAR Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Security Breach is the latest installment of the family-friendly horror games loved by millions of players from all over the globe.

Explore corridors dyed twilight crimson, witness the ethereal glow of -amber through paper walls of a traditional Japanese house and escape creeping black shadows in hospital rooms where the power is somehow always out. ◆Hide or die 10-year-old Ai has no defensive measures to defeat the enemies you face; instead, you must take advantage of each spirit\u2019s weaknesses to survive. Hold your breath to sneak past blind foes or dash past deaf ones as quick as your little legs can carry you.

PLAYSTATION 5 ENHANCEMENTS Enjoy massively reduced loading times thanks to the SSD and experience an augmented level of immersion with the Dual Sense controller. Feel object resistance, surface texture, damage feedback, heartbeat simulation and more thanks to the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. SYSTEM REDUX Veteran Observers can dive deeper into this dystopian reality thanks to three brand-new side cases to solve. \u201cErrant Signal\u201d, \u201cHer Fearful Symmetry\u201d and \u201cIt Runs in the Family\u201d add another layer of depth to the game\u2019s story while exploring thought-provoking themes of a future that soon might become our present. On top of that, System Redux offers expanded gameplay, which includes new game mechanics, new secrets to find, redesigned stealth, additional neural interrogations, and quality-of-life improvements made with the help of the Observer community. Newcomers get the chance to experience one of the most thrilling cyberpunk stories in all its next-gen glory: boasting 4K resolution, upgraded textures, new animations, models and effects, and transformed with jaw-dropping Ray-Tracing and HDR lighting. WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects\u2019 minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion. But remember, no matter how deep you go, you can never hide from an Observer.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-18","LowestPrice":"/game/82626","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/UP4176-PPSA02118_00-8840415776217330","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RseKlXtD8cE","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":13,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Observer: System Redux (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Bloober Team","ReleaseDate":"2021-07-22","Slug":"observer-system-redux-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":41.9,"MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":20.95,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-10-26","description":"Come celebrate 25 years of marsupial mayhem with the PlayStation® enhanced and exclusive Crash Bandicoot™ Anniversary Bundle that includes the Nitros Oxide Edition of Crash™ Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, exclusive for PlayStation® players.

Long ago it was the home of the brilliant and yet dangerous alchemists, but now lies abandoned and devastated. You play as Mya, an alchemist who has just woken up and finds herself in an unknown place, confused and with no memories of what happened. To explore the world you will need to use the power gained through combining the four elements \u2014 fire, water, air, earth \u2014 along with various ingredients. By making different potions, you will be able to explore the regions, solve alchemical puzzles, and fight dreadful enemies. Unveil the secrets of the mysterious world and discover your story! Key Features - Discover the mysterious world \u2014 During the game you will travel through different locations, from laboratories and dungeons, to the factory inside a volcano. Each region has many challenges, hidden secrets, different enemies to fight, and lore to discover. - Combine elements and make all kinds of potions \u2014 Use the four basic elements (fire, water, air, earth) along with special ingredients (from cuprum to nigredo) to create bombs, elixirs, and sword oils. - Transform the world around you \u2014 Interact with the environment using alchemy. Raise the water level of a lake, cross a river by creating ice platforms, use the wind to move objects, and create lightning to start an engine! - Solve alchemical puzzles \u2014 Combine elements to open chests, make paths, or find hidden objects. - Fight all kinds of monsters \u2014 Use elements to discover enemies\u2019 weaknesses and try different strategies to defeat them. - Switch between characters or play co-op \u2014 Join the journey as a flying homunculus that can fight, solve puzzles, collect resources, and play with a friend! Discover Isur For a long time, Isur was the capital of the region ruled by the alchemists, and thanks to the volcano that provided powerful resources, it was a thriving trade port. Ruled by the Council of Seven Master Alchemists, the city was known as a place where you can buy everything and, if you\u2019re lucky, even gain some of the alchemists\u2019 knowledge. Not many were chosen to become alchemists, and the Council always guarded their secrets carefully. Your journey will take place in 4 themed regions that are all connected to the central area. Combine Elements The alchemy system plays a central role in the game and you are free to create your own potions as there are no limitations or predetermined recipes. To create a potion, you will need to use one or several of the 4 primary elements: fire, water, air, and earth. Combining them and adding special ingredients will open up new possibilities and effects.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-18","LowestPrice":"/game/102781","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/0123/mjsGySgu6QXm0yoAcBVP6nbl.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP5036-CUSA24984_00-CHEMISTADVENTURE","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":13.95,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/0123/mjsGySgu6QXm0yoAcBVP6nbl.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Alchemist Adventure (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"INTRAGAMES","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-19","Slug":"alchemist-adventure-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":27.9,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":13.95,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-10-26","description":"The Premium Edition includes the base game SnowRunner and its Year 1 Pass.

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality. In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse. Features: \u2022 Survive the horror using adventure mechanics and exploration. \u2022 Experience a beautiful, erotic hand-painted art style with Eastern and Western influences. \u2022 Unlock additional outfits, some of which alter interactions throughout the game. \u2022 Keep track of the immersive lore with a convenient journal feature. \u2022 Discover multiple New Game+ modes, alternate endings and hidden extras! \u2022 Get in the mood with a visceral cinema-length soundtrack.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-18","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/0500/yXWVXhy5o38UeU8V01aiQGKb.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP2005-CUSA25376_00-SENSE00000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"65%","Completionist":"","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":9.76,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/0500/yXWVXhy5o38UeU8V01aiQGKb.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Sense - A Cyberpunk Ghost Story (Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"eastasiasoft","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-11","Slug":"sense--a-cyberpunk-ghost-story-simplified-chinese-english-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":27.9,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":9.76,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-02","description":"The Champion of Gaia pack includes: - 3 outfits for Cahal - 4 exclusive furs for the Wolf and Werewolf - A nature spirit to help you in combat - A unique finishing move","SaleStarted":"2022-10-18","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/3009/iOiXETyWC3CbdUzefwTzVkBv.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/EP4008-CUSA16782_00-WTASIEEDLC000002","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":9.95,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/3009/iOiXETyWC3CbdUzefwTzVkBv.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood Champion of Gaia Pack (English/Chinese Ver.)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-04","Slug":"werewolf-the-apocalypse--earthblood-champion-of-gaia-pack-englishchinese-ver-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.9,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":9.95,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-02","description":"The Champion of Gaia pack includes: - 3 outfits for Cahal - 4 exclusive furs for the Wolf and Werewolf - A nature spirit to help you in combat - A unique finishing move","SaleStarted":"2022-10-18","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/3009/iOiXETyWC3CbdUzefwTzVkBv.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/EP4008-PPSA02113_00-WTASIEEDLC000002","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":9.95,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/3009/iOiXETyWC3CbdUzefwTzVkBv.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood Champion of Gaia Pack (English/Chinese Ver.)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-04","Slug":"werewolf-the-apocalypse--earthblood-champion-of-gaia-pack-englishchinese-ver-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":19.9,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":9.95,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-02","description":"This DLC includes: - The exclusive Cahal The Exiled One outfit - Dark fur for the Werewolf and Wolf - An Auspice of Ahroun emblem embroidered on the outfit Exile was the only option to protect his family.

Enjoy a rich plot, with audio and visuals similar to a film, allowing players to live through unforgettable moments that will shock them even hours after playing the game. STORY Unravel the drama behind the distorted Feltons in their reclusive mansion. Rosemary enters Professor Felton's manor under the guise of a doctor to find Celeste, a girl gone missing. There, she sees something unspeakable and attempts to uncover the truth while evading the deranged professor. GAMEPLAY Step into the shoes of Rosemary as she uncovers the truth while running from Professor Felton in this unique and immersive survival horror game. The player can pick up items along the way to distract pursuers, but there are no guns or weapons for power plays. The key to survival is to memorize the mansion's layout, and to sneak around while using your sense of sound to keep track of your pursuer's location. Knowing when to hide from danger is also vital. There is no health gauge at the top of the screen, so the more you hone your senses, the better you'll do as you make your way through this horror flick. The soundtrack features original scores by music producer Nobuko Toda and Italian composer Luca Balboni. These scores from renown composers will incite dread and sorrow as they pull on your heart strings.

Set around a city being consumed from within by a disease, Plague Road tells a story of a lone doctor who once abandoned their home and now returns to learn the fate of those they left behind. Travel from the safe refuge of your farm through a series of regions progressively more affected by the infernal plague. On the road, rescue survivors and choose whether to use them as traveling companions or to improve the Doctor's farm and gain access to new abilities. How your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work. Some survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your ability to fight horrors created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring grid-based positioning and turn-based strategy mechanics.

With spine-tingling performances from a Hollywood cast including Hayden Panettiere (Heroes, Nashville) brought to life with the power of PlayStation®4 \u2013 your actions alone will decide who survives Until Dawn™.  Gripping story \u2013 Set at an isolated mountain lodge where nothing is as it seems, 8 friends try to stay alive with a killer on the loose. Players define the relationships between the characters through dialogue and experience the night from their unique point of view. Written in collaboration with famed horror writers and directors Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick, find out who will survive Until Dawn.  Next gen Horror \u2013 Harnessing the power of an evolved Killzone™ Shadowfall engine, this 3rd person interactive horror will shock and horrify players thanks to its realistic graphics and edge of your seat gameplay as they navigate their way through a terrifying night. The DUALSHOCK®4 motion sensor functionality will track how still you can be whilst in hiding from Until Dawn\u2019s fearsome terrors and the camera will capture player scares as they happen to share with friends.  \u201cButterfly Effect\u201d \u2013 Players carve their path to survival with branching story lines which mean that no two stories will be the same. Decisions, big and small, will shape each player\u2019s unique story. Inspired by the chaos theory, the butterfly effect could make trivial split-second decisions ripple into moments of grave peril.  Life-and-death moral dilemmas - Place yourself in impossible situations where there is no right or wrong answer. Friend or foe, live or die \u2013 make these decisions before it\u2019s too late.  Hollywood talent \u2013 With spine-tingling performances from a talented cast of Hollywood actors, including Hayden Panettiere (Heroes, Nashville) and Rami Malek, Until Dawn delivers credible performances that forge an emotional bond with players. This highly-charged emotional investment allows players to fear for a character\u2019s safety and is crucial to enjoying Until Dawn.
