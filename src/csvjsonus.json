In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane's unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you'll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you'll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You'll experience DEATHLOOP's main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you'll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you're feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna's stylish sneakers and invade another player's campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    <br />Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.",

        "description": "Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes.<br /><br />Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name.<br /><br />Don't be fooled—this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown!<br /><br />Story<br /><br />A long time ago...<br /><br />In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.<br />The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.<br />...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames,<br />a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.<br /><br />The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.<br />Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.<br />And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.<br />While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.<br /><br />In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.<br />To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy!<br /><br />Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins.<br /><br />In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these—and more—to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!<br /><br />In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!<br /><br />Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it!<br /><br />On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience—a first for the series.<br /><br />Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side.<br />Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported.<br /><br />Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled",

Blending the viciously over-the-top gunplay of its predecessor with the elegant precision of the powerful katana, Shadow Warrior is an imaginative take on the classic arcade-style shooter. Shadow Warrior tells the offbeat tale of Zilla Enterprise's corporate shogun Lo Wang as he is ordered to acquire a legendary blade of limitless power by his deceitful employer. Betrayed and left for dead, Lo Wang learns of the blade's connection to ancient gods from another realm preparing to push our world to the brink of destruction. Now the reluctant hero must become legend through a masterful combination of gun, blade, magic and wit to uncover the truth behind the demonic invasion and banish evil back into the darkness.<br /><br />Video output in Full HD 1080p requires 1080p native display.",

And if you're feeling creative, there are plenty of other ways to end your enemies' misery – hooks, lava pits, saws... no death will ever be the same again.<br /><br />If kicking corpses into a lava pit and adorning walls with blood is your idea of a good time, BUTCHER is THE game for you.",

Traction, angle, braking, torque, trajectory, speed… every factor must be considered before heading to the workshop to change certain components and configuring the optimal set-up.<br /><br />A DREAM GARAGE<br />Your adventure starts by choosing your dream bike. In RiMS Racing, you can ride the world's 8 most powerful European and Japanese motorcycles: Ducati Panigale V4 R, MV Agusta F4 RC, Aprilia RSV4, BMW M 1000 RR, Suzuki GSX-R1000R, Honda CBR1000RR, Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10RR, Yamaha YZF-R1. Recreated with an unmatched level of detail thanks to close collaboration with each manufacturer, these bikes also provide a highly accurate and realistic riding experience. They are true rough diamonds that only need a few cuts to shine their brightest!<br /><br />OPTIMISE YOUR BIKE<br />With a mechanics management system never before seen in a motorcycle simulation, you can dismantle all your bike's parts to maintain them after each race or to upgrade them and boost your performance. You will become familiar with every last screw in your bike. Browse a catalogue of over 500 official spare parts from the biggest names in the industry along with over 200 official equipment items to personalise your rider!<br /><br />ANALYSE YOUR PERFORMANCE<br />RiMS Racing thrusts you straight into the heart of the action with the Motorbike Status Check (MSC), which helps you analyse your bike's behaviour in real time and understand how to optimise your performance. Brake disc temperature, tyre pressure and wear, suspension behaviour affecting stability, electronic settings… Just like for a real rider, your bike's configuration can be adapted to your riding style!<br /><br />ACCURATE AND REALISTIC PHYSICS<br />The level of accuracy and details provided by the mechanics management and MSC is matched by realistic motorcycle physics that will thrill the most demanding of track racers. But thanks to the various ride assist technologies, less experienced players can still learn the techniques that will take them to the top.<br /><br />THE MOST ICONIC CIRCUITS<br />Silverstone, Laguna Seca, Suzuka, Nürburgring, Paul Ricard… Travel the world and enjoy thrilling races on 10 faithfully recreated official circuits. For those who prefer roads, five routes in the stunning landscapes of the United States, Norway, Australia, Spain and Italy have been recreated for a different racing experience on two wheels!<br /><br />MANAGE YOUR CAREER AND TEAM<br />Career mode in RiMS Racing gives you control of a team. Build your rider by managing their race calendar, choose which R&D areas to invest in, and upgrade the team's skills.

As a cyborg programmed to eradicate the last remnants of humanity, your sole purpose is to… well... annihilate anything that moves.<br /><br />So grab your weapon of choice (from chainsaws, to shotguns, to grenade launchers) and kill your way through underground hideouts, post-apocalyptic cities, jungles, and more. And if you're feeling creative, there are plenty of other ways to end your enemies' misery – hooks, lava pits, saws... no death will ever be the same again.<br /><br />If kicking corpses into a lava pit and adorning walls with blood is your idea of a good time, BUTCHER is THE game for you.",

But as more victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, will the scales of justice tip in favor of defending the law or enacting vengeance?<br /><br />From the studio that brought you the Yakuza series, Lost Judgment weaves elements of investigative sleuthing, noir narrative and action combat into one mystery thriller. Take your detective expertise to the streets of Japan and defend those that the law fails to protect.<br /><br />INVESTIGATIVE ACTION  <br />Tap into Yagami's arsenal of private eye tricks to gather clues. From hi-tech gadgets including drones and social media listening devices to hardboiled gumshoe methods like scaling buildings and tracking suspects in the city. No stronger evidence than catching a suspect in the act.<br /><br />FREEFORM COMBAT  <br />Master Yagami's three unique, combo-heavy martial arts styles to overcome any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Further weaponize street fights with traffic cones, street signs, bicycles and beyond, plus customize each style with skill trees.<br /><br />DEEP UNDERCOVER<br />Go undercover at a local high school as a club advisor to get to the root of a mysterious rise in delinquency as it relates to the case. Join the Dance Club, where you'll be grooving to the rhythm; the Robotics Club, tasking your ingenuity to build the ultimate Yagami-bot; a boxing gym, to stick and move against fierce opponents; and a bike gang, where underground racing is the only way to earn respect.<br /><br />HIT THE STREETS  <br />As you comb the open cities of Kamurocho and Ijincho in pursuit of the case, take a break and get to know the unique culture of each through bars and other nightlife hotspots. It may be worth taking on a Side Case to lend your detective skills to residents in need – you never know who holds what cards.",

A bystander's video footage of his attempt to flee the scene and subsequent apprehension is all over the news, and public outcry demands a maximum sentence.<br /><br />“Three days ago, a dead body was found in an abandoned building in Yokohama. Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room.<br /><br />His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further.<br /><br />How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice?<br /><br />From just a single stumble, one can become a monster…<br /><br />LAW AND DISORDER - Lost Judgment once again puts players in the sneakers of lawyer turned street-fighting detective Takayuki Yagami. Joined by his partner, ex-yazuka Masaharu Kaito, the crime-fighting duo is called on to investigate a seemingly perfect crime whose lead suspect has an airtight alibi. What starts out as a tale of revenge reveals a tangled web of conspiracy involving several unlikely factions taking advantage of a broken law system. But as victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, he must choose between defending the law or exacting justice.<br /><br />FREEFORM COMBAT - Yagami's distinct martial arts forms grant him mastery of any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Harness Crane, Tiger, and the new Snake stance, a graceful style that can deflect and return an opponent's strikes, using their energy against them.<br /><br />INVESTIGATIVE ACTION - Yagami's arsenal of detective tricks grows with new gadgets, stealthily tracking suspects, and crafty methods of infiltration. Leave no stone unturned in pursuit of the truth.<br /><br />NO PLACE FINER – Immerse yourself in the bustling downtowns of Tokyo and Yokohama at your own pace within an authentic setting that only the RGG Studio can deliver.

You'll need to explore, hunt for supplies, uncover clues, and fight your way through each anomaly – each consisting of semi-procedurally generated instances where both the environment, and the undead, are out to kill you!<br /><br />Immediately after the events of Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles, you find yourself trapped within the remains of Arzt Memorial Hospital – the hub to organize your inventory and storage cache, level up your character, or just to take a breather before venturing back out into the chaos. There's more to discover in the world besides murderous hordes of the undead – find the journals scattered about to learn more about the outbreak and ultimately where to find refuge!

You'll need to explore, hunt for supplies, uncover clues, and fight your way through each anomaly – each consisting of semi-procedurally generated instances where both the environment, and the undead, are out to kill you!<br /><br />Immediately after the events of Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles, you find yourself trapped within the remains of Arzt Memorial Hospital – the hub to organize your inventory and storage cache, level up your character, or just to take a breather before venturing back out into the chaos. There's more to discover in the world besides murderous hordes of the undead – find the journals scattered about to learn more about the outbreak and ultimately where to find refuge!

Control the arms of a squishy abomination and guide it through a deranged world where anything goes. Outrun ravenous rats, joyride a dirt bike, and vault over pools of unmentionable waste. One thing's certain: you will struggle.<br /><br />Two hideous heads are better than one <br />Inventive co-op will test the firmest of friendships.

Triumph over physics-based challenges, or get your arms ripped off in the process (don't worry, they grow back).<br /><br />Weird levels, even weirder objectives<br />Your pilgrimage encompasses dodgy labs, perilous canyons, and even a psychedelic fever dream. Plug waste-spewing pipes with your flailing limbs, launch yourself across yawning chasms, and discover complex machinery you have no business operating.<br /><br />Gleefully depraved visuals<br />Grotesque graphics drawn by appalling human hands. From moist cavities to glistening guts, nothing is off limits. As the mistakes mount, so does the bodily damage, with ugly mishaps leaving unsightly marks on your face.<br /><br />An ever-mutating character<br />Unlock a range of game-changing powers as you go. These include time slowing to dodge fast-moving hazards, detachable arms you can make crawl around creepily, and the ability to graft your appendage onto the environment.

Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you!<br /><br />In the course of each case, you'll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimonies, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn't be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn't shout “OBJECTION!” when you know you've got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution's claims and prove your client's innocence.<br /><br />The game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease! Will you be able to crack these clever cases? The game is afoot!<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

He used to be a wizard, which was fine and all, but he's in his 30s now, and he wants to settle down, get some peace and quiet. But that's not easy to get with all those spike-haired buffoons dragging their giant swords around and ruining the pavement.

        "description": "Warlock's Tower is a retro puzzler with elegantly designed levels around one simple rule - one move equals one life lost. Playing as mailman Tim, you must brave the tower and its complex rooms of maddening puzzles, in a bid to reach the top and deliver a peace offering to the Warlock.<br /><br />Clearing each room won't be easy, though! Every step you take costs a life point, monsters and traps are everywhere, and some rooms require two characters working in tandem to proceed!<br /><br />Delivering the post has never been so challenging. Watch your step!<br /><br />Features:<br /> * Solve 100+ increasingly complex rooms<br /> * Outwit zombies, flying eyes, & slimes. Your ever-diminishing steps are far from the only danger.<br /> * Feel the 80s! Retro, 8-bit aesthetics make you feel like you're playing your favourite handheld again.<br /><br />PS Vita: One time license fee entitles play on up to 3 PlayStation Vita systems activated by this account.",

Over the course of a year, the two bond — first, as friends, and then as something more.<br /><br />Features:<br />* Around 80,000 word kinetic story (approx 5-6 hours of reading)<br />* Detailed background and character art<br />* A custom OST<br />* Daily messages from Kyouko, the story's heroine<br />* A cute single mother!",

Your team starts at the bottom, but you may be invited to take part in the major races if the organisers see that your results are good enough. <br />You can create and gradually level up your own rider in Pro Leader mode as you strive to become the next cycling legend to compete with the likes of Primoz Roglic, Tedej Pogacar and others. You can choose from four different profiles: climber, sprinter, puncher and versatile. Your choice will be crucial if your aim is to win a Grand Tour or be a specialist in the Classics!<br /><br />Create your own Tour<br />My Tour mode has been redesigned to offer you more freedom. With the new interface it is now easier to customise your \"My Tour\" (rest days, stages, teams). You can now choose the list of participating teams and national teams. Choose from 89 stages to create your race.<br /><br />Enjoy a wide range of content<br /><br />The game includes the 19 World Tour teams and their jerseys as well as the teams Alpecin-Fenix, B&B Hotels P/B KTM, Team Arkéa - Samsic and Total Direct Energie. There are also many official races (Paris-Roubaix, Paris-Nice, LBL, etc.)<br /><br />More realistic peloton<br />We have redesigned the actions of riders in the peloton to recreate the behaviour found in real races:<br />-Favourites ride closer to each other<br />- The yellow jersey is better placed at the front of the peloton<br />-Pursuit of the early breakaway is more realistic with fewer teams getting involved, which gives the leader's team the upper hand, just like in real life<br />- Teams that want to catch the breakaway but don't attack or that reduce the peloton in the race on the flat now have consistent behaviour<br /><br />Revamped objectives<br /><br />Before the start of each stage, you can now set the objective for each rider thanks to a new \"Select Rider\" page, which includes all the information you need to make a choice (ranking, role, race-day condition). Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race.<br /><br />A new recovery mechanic<br />Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. <br />Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating. The lower the rating, the more the recovery profile penalises the race-day condition.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",
