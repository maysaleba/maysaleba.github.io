A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age. The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station Cities struggle for survival, both with each other and the mutant horrors that await outside. You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised underground. Having never ventured beyond the city limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat. Rather than stand united, the factions of the Metro are locked in a struggle for the ultimate power, a doomsday device from the military vaults of D6.

Experience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game's eponymous villain 'Hex'.

A small humanoid robot wakes up in the debris of a landfill inside a large factory. He receives strange and enigmatic messages, from someone who apparently wants to help him. The robot's purpose is to explore the large factory where he is in search of answers about who he and his mysterious remote helper are. The player does not control the robot directly and in real time, but inserts movement commands above its display in order to tell the robot when it is time to jump, to crouch and more. It is therefore a puzzle game based on perspective: the player must calculate the spaces between the robot and the obstacles. The obstacles are initially totally static, but as they advance they will be more and more dynamic and varied. For example, we will have guard robots that will perform the same actions as our robot in a mirrored manner. There are currently 40 levels, with 8 types of obstacles. The real challenge will consist in finishing the level with the minimum possible number of indications (input) and providing these commands in a single line (string), ending the level while simultaneously satisfying these conditions will unlock the \"\"gold chip\"\" of that particular level. The \"\"gold chip\"\" will be used to unlock new skins for our robot. This title is therefore suitable both for those looking for a relaxing puzzle, given the non-dynamic gameplay, and for those looking for a challenge given its arcade nature. - Original puzzle game - Suitable for all ages - Many types of obstacles - Relaxing but with a good level of challenge - 40 levels, expandable - Original art sector - Skins for the character - No microtransactions","SaleStarted":"2022-12-07","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0918/J74I6xtnTXOobXQ5SGU1zxnZ.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5958-CUSA37534_00-8414521300449014","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Puzzle","PlusPrice":3.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0918/J74I6xtnTXOobXQ5SGU1zxnZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Escape String","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"7 RAVEN STUDIOS CO.

Each maze is a procedurally generated level where the enemies, items, and the maze\u2019s layout itself is random. Not a single corner you turn will be the same as the last time you entered. Progressively tougher alien foes will try to take you out once you enter their proximity so you better be ready to shoot first and ask questions later.

The goal is simple - enter the maze and gun down anything that stands between you and the exit. Your objective may always be the same but everything else is endlessly changing. Each maze is a procedurally generated level where the enemies, items, and the maze\u2019s layout itself is random. Not a single corner you turn will be the same as the last time you entered. Progressively tougher alien foes will try to take you out once you enter their proximity so you better be ready to shoot first and ask questions later. Modifiers scattered around each maze will augment your abilities and shots. Each pick-up presents a unique choice that\u2019ll define your play style. Simplicity is at the heart of Maze Blaze. It\u2019s easy to jump into yet has enough depth to keep you playing. You can kick back in a long gaming session or just clear a couple of mazes when you\u2019ve got a bit of downtime. No matter how you choose to play, you\u2019ll always make progress. The more mazes you blast through, the more stuff you unlock. Mix and match your newly acquired powers and weapons to dive even further into the different game modes.

You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies. Possible alternate history flow - what would have happened if the Allies followed the ideas of Operation Unthinkable and went to war against the USSR in 1946? Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Advanced army manager - choose the composition of your forces. Acquire new units, upgrade or dismiss the outdated ones. Make sure that your forces have all the necessary tools for the upcoming battle. Real WW2 heroes - assign historical personalities to your armies and get access to special skills. Realistic 3D graphics - study the battle map and take advantage of 3D graphics, featuring volumetric terrain and physically-simulated movement of units. Attention to detail - game created by a team passionate about WW2 history.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-07","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0910/r28qdLdXatQ9aY1ux0GGRoQl.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4713-CUSA34475_00-1465942937537581","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":"","genre":"Strategy","PlusPrice":20.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0910/r28qdLdXatQ9aY1ux0GGRoQl.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Klabater","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-22","Slug":"strategic-mind-fight-for-freedom-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":22.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-12-22","description":"AUTHENTIC GAMEPLAY With the dual stick controls, each stick represents one of your feet.

Whatever happened, she was driven to find order, to find a way to balance the odds. The rabbit hole she followed led deeper and deeper into a shadowy sect of the AHA that sought to keep the world\u2019s unpalatable truths covered. As she passed from success to success, the sect assigned her to straighten out one of their wayward sons, Isaac Powell. Powell, now The Night Seer, impressed Ozols with his vision of a world turned upside down. She grew jealous of his foresight and saw the way to achieve the justice she craved: a way to balance the rightness of actions by both their past and future effects. Ozols gained the Night Seer\u2019s trust, and he confided in her the ritual he had undertaken. She repeated it, and as the power coursed through her, it left her blind to the present, but with a powerful and uncanny sense of what was to come. But seeing the Night Seer\u2019s path, more vividly than he himself had ever managed, shocked Ozols. She shredded her white robes and dyed them black. The symbols of power she\u2019d once daubed in blood, she bleached again with the light from the corrupted moon, enriching her affinity for Dark Sight. She tied the scraps around her weapons, sure reminders to keep her path true. Relying on her heightened perception, familiarity with Dark Sight, and uncanny foresight, Ozols now pursues the Night of the Hunter and any who would work towards their goals. In turn, the Night Seer feels the threat of there being one with greater power than himself, and knows that his prophecy will not come true if another has witnessed it.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

PLAY AS 3 ORIGINAL VAMPIRES Play as 3 vampires who are over a hundred years old. Progress in the game through their intertwined destinies, deal with their different points of view and use their character sheets to try to separate the truth from the lies. Each character has their own vampiric abilities and disciplines that you can upgrade individually to suit your preferred approach. Will you choose intimidation, seduction or stealth? It's your decision, as long as you can sate your Hunger for blood. GAMEPLAY WITH CONSEQUENCES With its unique gameplay, Swansong puts emphasis on the consequences of your actions in both the investigation and your social interactions with other characters. Analyse each situation carefully because your decisions can have huge consequences on your heroes' lives and the fate of the Boston Camarilla.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-07","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6665-PPSA07303_00-VTMS000000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7L7M0R8fzA","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":999999,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2022-05-19","Slug":"vampire-the-masquerade--swansong-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":59.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":29.99,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-12-22","description":"The source of evil, it has brought numerous monster corps.

With less ammo around, the Resistance of Östertörn have started building their own weapons to keep fighting the machine invasion. Despite their more makeshift nature, these new weapons are proving to be both efficient and deadly. Mid-tier versions of these three resistance weapons can be found in the PLUNDRA storage box in Östertörn. If this is your first time playing the game, you will find them in the storage box at the Iboholmen Church. Higher tier versions of the weapons can also be found by taking the fight to the machines and looting the weapons from their wreckage. These weapons are: \u2022 Resistance Pitchfork - At first glance it could be dismissed as a simple farmer\u2019s tool, but this pitchfork has been reinforced and transformed into an effective Resistance weapon. The pitchfork has excellent reach, which is great for doing damage from a safer distance. \u2022 Resistance Heavy Bow - Built using scavenged machine parts, this heavy bow packs a powerful punch, but requires more skill to use. The enhanced power of the bow also allows it to fire heavy, modified arrows, making this a versatile tool. \u2022 Resistance Flamethrower - While it may look like an accident waiting to happen, the flamethrower's powerful napalm fuel causes massive damage to machines by sticking to them while it burns, quickly melting its vulnerable internal parts. Special weapon ammo and attachments include: \u2022 Resistance Standard Arrow - A regular arrow that does a lot of damage to components but is weak against armor. \u2022 Resistance Explosive Arrow - A special type of arrow that explodes on impact, dealing extra explosive damage to its target. \u2022 Resistance Flare Arrow - An arrow with an emergency flare attached. The lit flare will lure any enemy's attention and fire away from you and onto the flare, even if that flare is now pinned to another machine. \u2022 3-Pin Makeshift Bow Sight - This 3-Pin Bow sight features three pins calibrated to hit at a certain distance, working best when the distance to the target is known. \u2022 Large Flamethrower Tank - A larger tank that can hold more fuel, letting you relentlessly melt enemy machines for longer without needing to refuel.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-07","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2910/QAUfPaFQ3zo3RYLNLTbJOXjw.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5259-CUSA12260_00-RESISTANCEWEAPON","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Adventure","PlusPrice":2.59,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2910/QAUfPaFQ3zo3RYLNLTbJOXjw.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Generation Zero® - Resistance Weapons Pack","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Systemic Reaction AB","ReleaseDate":"2022-05-12","Slug":"generation-zero--resistance-weapons-pack-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":3.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":2.59,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-12-22","description":"DOG\u2019S DONUTS is a physical-based puzzle game where you control a machine that shoots donuts.

Use stealth and tactics to overcome the never-ending onslaught of monsters, the manifestations of your god's decay. DEFINITIVE UPDATE: ▪ 3 new enemy types. Prepare to fight swarms of feral bats, witches of the wood, and elder vampires. ▪ 30 new weapons with unique abilities to add to your arsenal. ▪ Overwatch added to ease up your ambushes. Snipe any foes running into your range. ▪ Tug of war mechanics. Push a beast into a trap or pull it into the range of ally's overwatch. ▪ Rebalance of corruption system. Cursed weapons and items give you immense power but at a cost of slowly losing yourself. ▪ New questline: uncover dark secrets of House Blackwell. ▪ New hunter skin - hunt in style. FEATURES: ▪ Stealth, ambush-based combat. Try to outsmart and outwit all the horrifying creatures you\u2019ll be facing, as they are way stronger and you don\u2019t stand a chance in a direct assault; ▪ Diverse, challenging opponents. From werewolves to vampires, all monsters have their unique attacks and skills and can easily see, hear or smell you from the distance. So be careful not to reveal your position too early; ▪ Stamina-based characters. Cautiously manage your energy level between attacking, moving and casting spells. In the end, you\u2019re only a human and running out of energy will seriously fatigue you; ▪ A grim world plunged in half-darkness. In this world, our god has finally turned his back on us and his corrupt presence can change the intensity of the battlefield. From summoning monsters, through changing the weather, to transforming one of the creatures into a powerful avatar of his will; ▪ A vagabond\u2019s exploration system. Travel the world bringing your mobile base along with you. Take shelter in and manage your camp, but be wary of enemy ambushes; ▪ A unique fusion of dark Victorian fantasy and wild west. Immerse yourself in a world so different from the one you know. The universe shaped by struggle, where mankind has not had the freedom to develop or advance any of its technology. Manage your scarce resources, venture out with your fellow companions and explore the remnants of the world in search of the means for mankind's survival. Monsters can detect a hunter's presence by their scent, they can then use this to track down where the hunters are. Observe the wind - keeping yourself downwind of your adversaries will aid you in your hunt. Although, hunters can use their scent to their advantage by preparing an ambush using traps, then luring the monsters towards it. Monsters are not the only threat the hunters will face on their hunts - the presence of the old god is growing ever stronger, changing everything it touches. The darkness can summon more enemies against the hunters, or even change them into an avatar of its will. Hunters can equip different weapons, heavy, more powerful ones that will drain their stamina when used. And smaller ones, better for stealth actions. Within their camp, our hunters can craft new items or get some rest.

That\u2019s not all, the 3 new weapon skins are just as important for your enemies as they are you, at least they\u2019ll know they\u2019ve been slain by the best looking weapons out there. Let them keep some dignity... The Cyber Warrior Pack contains: 2 NEW WEAPONS \u2022 Brosnan, a ballistic automatic rifle: low calibre ammunition combined with extreme exit speed allows for piercing bullets to cut through most obstacles, puncturing intestines and plating alike. \u2022 Interuptor, a new special weapon: stasis tech cleverly applied to live ammunition, allowing for great crowd control and pure blue chaos when used right! 1 NEW TACTICAL \u2022 PLM22 Surge, a lethal mine: mainly used as a defence against monobot and robot units, these charged proximity mines comes packed with a very strong digital blast that'll fry most nearby systems. 7 PIECES OF ARMOR \u2022 Feud Vest, Basic torso protection Light and unrestrictive. The Feud vest allows for great flexibility and doesn't hinder your movement. A good choice when speed and efficiency are important. \u2022 Feud Armor, medium torso protection The main piece in the Feud line. It offers full upper body protection without slowing you down. If you want a true Cyber Warrior experience, this is for you. \u2022 Feud Banner, advanced torso protection What could possibly make the Feud Armor better? It carries with it many of the properties from the original armor but with a slightly more premium build. \u2022 Nomad, basic head protection An old-school helmet that\u2019s mainly used when working outside of settlements in rough environments. Whilst not offering the latest in tech and features, it still provides solid protection against having your head bashed in. \u2022 Feud Mask, medium head protection The mark piece for the Cyber Warrior kit. You don't need to fake a smile with this on. It does a decent job of protecting your face while also boosting several aspects of the wearer. \u2022 Feud Helmet, advanced head protection The full headpiece for the Cyber Warrior kit. If you want to put fear in your enemies, this is the answer. Thanks to very light material, it allows for great manoeuvrability despite its large size. \u2022 Feud Trousers, medium leg protection A set of fairly neutral trousers that goes with the Cyber Warrior Feud set. Offering a safeguard against your shins, the Feud Trousers complete Cyber Warrior experience. 3 NEW WEAPON SKINS \u2022 2 new animated weapon skins: Glitch Green and Glitch Red \u2022 1 new weapon skin: Ultra Be the Samurai Cyber Warrior you deserve to be!

While this is still not enough to stave off the machine invasion, it should help the fighters tackle most situations and battles. Mid-tier versions of these three new US weapon models can be found in the PLUNDRA storage box in Östertörn. If this is your first time playing the game, you will find them in the storage box at the Iboholmen Church. Higher tier versions of the weapons can also be found by taking the fight to the machines and looting the weapons from their wreckage. These weapons are: \u2022 COM-10 SMG - The COM-10 is a high recoil yet very fast firing SMG that is sometimes used by the US army in special operations. \u2022 S21 - A sniper version of the classic S14 battle rifle with improved accuracy and adjustments to fit a scope mount. \u2022 G79 Grenade Launcher - The G79 was created by the US army to grant infantry an impressive mix of firepower, range and accuracy and at the same time achieve being more portable than a mortar.

A dreamlike journey into a surreal world of the artist\u2019s own creations where the atmospheric gameplay provides mysteries to discover, puzzles to solve and artistic landscapes to explore. GAMEPLAY You find yourself on an evolving island. As you investigate your surroundings, the island will start to change. The appearance of a ship, the rise of a lighthouse, each mystery you uncover and puzzle you solve will unfold new wonders and unveil new places to explore. But be forewarned, the scene you find yourself in, this breathtaking land of paint and oil is not always as straightforward as it appears. This intriguing world within the canvas holds more mysteries than even the artist intended. STORY Prague July 20th 1945 The city of Prague was under siege, ravaged by war. Buildings were falling, churches were burning, and everything was to be washed away forever. A painter lived there, isolated from the outside world. The worse the terrors of war became, the more the artist obsessively painted beautiful landscapes as a contrast to the evil he had witnessed. One night, a mysterious figure appeared in the house seemingly out of nowhere. The stranger walked slowly around the room, inspecting the paintings. He then sat down in front of the artist; to offer him a deal. The chance to enter one of his own creations, far away and free of war. But he would have to find his way back out before midnight, or else his soul would become trapped in the canvas forever.

A dreamlike journey into a surreal world of the artist\u2019s own creations where the atmospheric gameplay provides mysteries to discover, puzzles to solve and artistic landscapes to explore. GAMEPLAY You find yourself on an evolving island. As you investigate your surroundings, the island will start to change. The appearance of a ship, the rise of a lighthouse, each mystery you uncover and puzzle you solve will unfold new wonders and unveil new places to explore. But be forewarned, the scene you find yourself in, this breathtaking land of paint and oil is not always as straightforward as it appears. This intriguing world within the canvas holds more mysteries than even the artist intended. STORY Prague July 20th 1945 The city of Prague was under siege, ravaged by war. Buildings were falling, churches were burning, and everything was to be washed away forever. A painter lived there, isolated from the outside world. The worse the terrors of war became, the more the artist obsessively painted beautiful landscapes as a contrast to the evil he had witnessed. One night, a mysterious figure appeared in the house seemingly out of nowhere. The stranger walked slowly around the room, inspecting the paintings. He then sat down in front of the artist; to offer him a deal. The chance to enter one of his own creations, far away and free of war. But he would have to find his way back out before midnight, or else his soul would become trapped in the canvas forever. Feeling alone, on the edge of madness, terrorized by the scent of death creeping in from the streets, the artist shook the mysterious man's hand, accepting the deal. A few moments later, the house was empty.

First Class Trouble is a party game where players must work together and against each other to survive a disaster. Whether you play as one of the human Residents or the rebellious Personoids, you will have to use your wit (and the occasional flying champagne bottle) to stay alive. In First Class Trouble you either deceive or deduce your way to victory in a charming, yet unsettling and often mischievous environment. Whether you do it sober or with a slight buzz, First Class Trouble will serve you a dangerous cocktail of difficult decisions and whacky possibilities. The goal is to shut down the Central Artificial Intelligence Network, also known as CAIN, of the luxurious intergalactic cruise ship ISS Alithea before it and its loyal Personoids take control of the ship. Two Roles: Trust and Deceive Resident Gameplay Collect information about the passengers and deduce who you can trust and who to avoid. Collaborate with your fellow residents to eliminate the suspected Personoids before engaging in the shutdown of CAIN. Personoid Gameplay Lie, disrupt and deceive your way through the ship among the residents to either reach CAIN and unleash its full potential or kill off the remaining residents to secure control of the vessel. Use your unique skills to communicate and navigate the ship in the shadows and kill off residents when they pose a threat to your identity. Additional Features: \u2022 Character & Vruumba Customization - Aboard the ISS Alithea, the customization possibilities are endless. Shop for new clothes and accessories in the onboard mall using your hard-earned Infinity Coins. Use your spare cash to pimp that Vruumba (Trademark not pending) of yours! \u2022 Endless Kill Scenarios - The ISS Alithea is the ultimate playground for happy accidents. Explore new ways to eliminate both friend and foe in each level. Environmental hazards such as fires, bad wiring and poorly hanging chandeliers can all be used to get rid of your fellow passengers when you find it convenient. \u2022 Physicalized Interactions & Items - Interact with your fellow residents and personoids in unlimited, physicalized ways. Whack your friend to the end of the pool with the racket or simply nudge that foe into the fire and look away for a while. \u2022 Enhance social deduction and interactions through in-game proximity based voice chat, ingame text chat and emote wheel functionality \u2022 Several levels with unique themes and styles, along with items & interactions specific for them \u2022 6 player multiplayer If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You\u2019re the only human there, after all. SURVIVAL Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game \u2013 including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™\u2019s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-07","LowestPrice":"/game/80159","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0114/xvUwYjctSRFXETMYPdfkwDUc.png?w=200","MainStory":22,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4380-PPSA03753_00-3992162449385066","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9cj2mae5w","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":46,"genre":"Action, Strategy","PlusPrice":16.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0114/xvUwYjctSRFXETMYPdfkwDUc.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Riftbreaker","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"EXOR Studios","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-14","Slug":"the-riftbreaker-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":35,"SalePrice":19.49,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-12-22","description":"Catty & Batty: The Spirit Guide is a casual couch co-op puzzle game, inspired by Lemmings and Tower Defense!

History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.

Discover the power of morality in each journey where choices and actions have meaningful consequences. Hindsight 20/20 is founded on five pillars: 1. Choice in Combat: Decide the fate of two kingdoms as one-armed warrior Jehan. Will he choose to respect the values of his former home by respecting life in all forms? Or will he choose the path of conflict and violence? Before every battle, make the conscious decision to wield a non-lethal stun rod to pacify enemies or a ruthless sword to put them down for good. 2. A Malleable World: Champaner and its inhabitants switch between several states of disdain or acceptance for Jehan. Each playthrough shows only one version of the world as both the town and its inhabitants experience the effects of Jehan\u2019s choices and actions. 3. Interesting AI and Bosses: All NPCs react to the world Jehan shapes. Dialogue options and weapon choice are only two factors in how the AI behaves. Hindsight 20/20\u2019s bosses exhibit emotion, making them more relatable. Nuances in their personality come to light as Jehan continues on his journey. The line between good and evil blurs as they react to Jehan. 4. The Experience Engine: The Experience Engine is a hand-crafted, in-house gameplay engine driven by player choice. This engine is solely responsible for creating the dynamic gameplay and story experiences Jehan witnesses. Every action and choice made is observed and recorded by the Experience Engine leading to a high level of replayability. This feedback loop of choices, actions, and reactions affect the flow of the story and drives the gameplay of Hindsight 20/20. 5. Ten different endings: Hindsight 20/20 has 10 different endings and four of those endings have absolutely no overlap. Each ending is carefully tailored to the choices and actions made in that journey. And unlocking each ending grants specific trophies as well.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-07","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/1421/qhGftTvX2ZCXDKenG5LwkwfY.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4391-PPSA03010_00-HINDSIGHT2020PS5","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role Playing Games, Action","PlusPrice":3.74,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/1421/qhGftTvX2ZCXDKenG5LwkwfY.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Hindsight 20/20 - Wrath of the Raakshasa","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"TRIPLE-I GAMES","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-09","Slug":"hindsight-2020--wrath-of-the-raakshasa-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":14.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":7.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-12-22","description":"Hellraiser is a new Chapter in Dead by Daylight.

Little did he know that he would soon be caught up in a maelstrom of conspiracies involving the Legion, the Resistance, and the Rat Gang. ●Seamless Maps Filled with Challenges to Explore Explore more than a dozen unique areas in a Action Platformer style map.

Forced to play children\u2019s games in a world of never-ending dusk, Ai is hunted by otherworldly entities as her life hangs in the balance. When these horrors begin to bleed into the real world, Ai must accept that she has only three choices: hide, run, or die. ◆Evolving gameplay Test your courage in a dangerous game of hide and seek before initiating a terrifyingly twisted version of tag with abominations not of this world. Use the items you\u2019ve gathered to flee your sunset hell, but be sure to remember the paths you\u2019ve taken or risk being trapped there forever. ◆Japanese locations ablaze with a haunting, beautiful sunset Experience an unnerving mix of beauty, fear and nostalgia in a mysterious world where a Japanese house, school and hospital are all inexplicably connected. Explore corridors dyed twilight crimson, witness the ethereal glow of -amber through paper walls of a traditional Japanese house and escape creeping black shadows in hospital rooms where the power is somehow always out. ◆Hide or die 10-year-old Ai has no defensive measures to defeat the enemies you face; instead, you must take advantage of each spirit\u2019s weaknesses to survive. Hold your breath to sneak past blind foes or dash past deaf ones as quick as your little legs can carry you. And if you can\u2019t get away in time, prepare to suffer a dire fate at the hands of unimaginable forces. ◆A tragic tale of friendship, betrayal and facing your demons Mute and anxious, Ai is grateful when she makes a group of friends to play with. But it turns out that the ghostly apparitions trapped in the world of dusk aren't the only things she has to contend with; ghosts can be cruel, but children even more so. Your classmates harbour dark thoughts and harrowing secrets that you must uncover to progress. Throughout the game, Ai will learn more about her new friends than perhaps she'd care to know... ◆If only there were another way\u2026 Upon clearing the game, another ending will become available to you. What story will this new path unveil? Slipping back into the terrifying world of Yuoni will see you face considerably more challenging foes for an even greater reward.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-07","LowestPrice":"/game/97173","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/1901/3dX5u5FMCL78N4VpYUXkQPfD.png?w=200","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5258-PPSA02511_00-CHOR000000020DUS","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure, Horror","PlusPrice":10.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/1901/3dX5u5FMCL78N4VpYUXkQPfD.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Yuoni","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Chorus Worldwide Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-08-19","Slug":"yuoni-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":21.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":13.19,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-12-22","description":"Journey deep into the abyss as a daring adventurer of your own design!

This game is a remaster of the classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter, delivered with a new game engine, improved graphics, advanced dinosaur behaviors, and seamless player progression. Experience an out of this world hunting experience, as you track down and stalk dinosaurs! To survive you'll need to know your target\u2019s temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings, because you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end up being lunch. On your hunting adventure, you will visit beautiful but dangerous environments, each with their own unique Ecosystems. Explore the pristine beaches, dense jungles, rocky plains, and scorching deserts of planet FMM UV-32. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. You can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth tactics or gaining the high ground will give you an edge over the more vicious dinosaurs roaming the planet. Careful planning and consideration must be taken before every hunt including weapon choice. Will you use a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, or a silent crossbow? Maybe bring along a sidearm just in case. One of the most important items you will need is your handheld M.I.S.T. (Mobile Interstellar Satellite Transponder), which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking these beasts easier. There are other items you can bring on your hunt to improve your chances of survival such as Cover Scent, which masks your smell. You will track down a wide range of dinosaurs, each species with their own behavior patterns and intelligence levels - everything from \"pea-brained\" dummies to cunning apex predators, with heightened senses of sight, hearing, and smell. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species, each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, others will attack because they feel threatened, and the rest will kill anything that moves! So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted.

Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive? If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode! Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play. You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type. The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it.

This deluxe collection brings you every stage from both of famously tough action platform games, remixed & re-balanced plus an all-new, never-before-seen final chapter to bring the experience together for the ultimate experience in nerd rage. Featuring...Enhanced Visuals! Experience the 8-bit ugliness in a whole new way with the updated Game Engine! And by updated, we mean \"Rebuilt the first game from the ground up in the superior second game's engine.\" Trust us, it feels better. Improved level design and difficulty options! Both games are infamously hard-as-nails, but Normal and Easy difficulties come with infinite lives, so take as many attempts as you need to beat the challenge. Level designs have been improved upon to really nail the balance between tough and fair. Or perhaps you loved the limited lives and ludicrous overuse of instant-death blocks in the original release? We've got you covered. Just select \"Old School\" or higher from the difficulty menu and you'll be cursing the developers' name in no time. Quality of Life Improvements! Faster respawning (When you die, which will be often, you'll just pop right back out of the Toaster and get on with your day, just like nature intended!), multiple save slots, accessibility options and more mean that anybody can take on the challenge. Surprises! Perhaps you've never played either of these games, perhaps you're new to the sequel, or maybe you have spent years achieving the world speedrun record for both, but whatever your experience with the series, there are plenty of surprises in store for you!New Chapter, Completing The Story! \"Wait, the game had a story\" You ask? To which we say: ...Kinda! But there's more of it now! Beat both games to unlock the epic finale! And more!","SaleStarted":"2022-12-07","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/1616/CFs4gDrL8mqW09rfM3o04UgO.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5420-CUSA24806_00-6128277563424915","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8EO9nVk1Tc","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":6.74,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/1616/CFs4gDrL8mqW09rfM3o04UgO.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Angry Video Game Nerd I & II Deluxe","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"SCREENWAVE MEDIA","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-25","Slug":"angry-video-game-nerd-i--ii-deluxe-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":14.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":7.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-12-22","description":"Run, Gun and Eat your way through this roguelite RPG shooter.

The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America\u2019s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-07","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2660-CUSA23291_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"66%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":6.11,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Disjunction - Digital Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-28","Slug":"disjunction--digital-deluxe-edition-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":17.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":6.11,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-12-22","description":"Deep within a forest, in a place far, far away, there lived the most peculiar of inhabitants.

The old man fell ill and he's now fighting for his life. Timothy, who loves his grandfather very much, decides to take a risky journey to the infamous Mysterious Forest. Legends speak of a magic mushroom able to cure any disease that grows into the forest. Timothy bravely begins his journey to find the magic mushroom.

The high difficulty level is the base: Timothy is basically defenceless and dies with a single touch from enemies or traps.

When proof was obtained that there were survivors hiding in multiple locations in Östertörn, resolution \"Reaction: Phase 1\" was passed at NATO, as an urgent, temporary solution: large quantities of standard-issue weapons used in the American military were to be dropped all over Östertörn, in order to offer immediate assistance and support to the various groups of survivors. Mid-tier versions of these three US weapons will now be available in any PLUNDRA storage box on Östertörn; if you are new to the game, you will find them in the storage box at the Iboholmen Church. Higher tier versions of the weapons can also be found by defeating and looting enemies. These weapons are: N9 Handgun - A proven, medium-power 9mm semi-automatic pistol. Standard-issue pistol for the US Army. Good for short-range encounters and as a last resort when your main weapon runs dry. N16 Assault Rifle - Standard-issue assault rifle for the US Army. Easy to handle and equipped with a burst fire. Excels at medium to long range encounters due to its accuracy, sight options and fire mode versatility.

Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance.

You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.

But most importantly, it\u2019s about understanding your cat. In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it\u2019s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system. This game fits best for... - People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work - Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids - Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding - Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about \u2018wasting their time\u2019 (although we believe you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty at all while playing games!) - Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun - Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it - People who like smart cats Learn how machine learning works in real life!

That means you\u2019ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That\u2019s what real data scientists do! Coding just got real! Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it\u2019s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market!

But it\u2019s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe!

The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know).

OVO travels through the metaphorical world, overcoming dangers and collecting mysterious symbols. These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you. Features: - Flow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black - upward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being carried by a flow. - Fascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions. - Design without words.

Explore a dense open world of terror, every building a unique location with its own story to tell. Strung together by the remnants of Hanwell. There is something deeply unsettling about Hanwell. Unexplained noises, something in the corner of your eye or laying just beyond the shadows create an atmosphere that will keep you constantly on edge. Monsters roam the streets. They occasionally get into the once protected buildings. What you do with them is up to you, be resourceful and pick up whatever you can find in order to fight them. Or run. And don't look back. There is an entire city to explore, featuring different environments each more distinct than the last. From residential homes, old English pubs, parks, stores, supermarkets and government buildings, all the way to the infamous HCPP research centre. Each location holds its own backstory, leading to your arrival. 1 player 16GB minimum save size DUALSHOCK®4 Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
