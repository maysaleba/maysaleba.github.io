His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder.

You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter.

This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game's eponymous villain 'Hex'.

Fortunately, up to 4 friends can join forces together to carry this burden (or drop it on each other's heads). Monkey around by yourself Waiting for friends to join you? Don’t worry! You can have fun in the single player campaign! Fancy blocks for every occasion To make the job more interesting, you’ll find some rather unusual blocks at your disposal. If you thought this would all be easy, wait until you have to try and catch a stray rocket block flying around, or handle an explosive nuclear fusion cube. Choose your chimpion Animals of all shapes and sizes come to help out, thumb-owners or not! Monkeys, dogs, cats (possibly a unicorn too?) - you name it! They’re all eager to suit up and monkey around. Earn your bananas Bananas are the space food of the future! Secure your bunch by beating the time scores, and if you gather enough, you’ll unlock some new buddies!","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/1013/7UdDYwHvR8NmuUDDzWWIhJNF.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2627-CUSA20587_00-BONKIESEU0000000","80%","0","Casual, Party, Unique","78.75","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/bonkies","Bonkies","TRD","Crunching Koalas Sp. z o.o.

"76","2024-11-13","Navigate the masked deceptions and deadly magic of a vividly Venetian city in this fully voiced pause-for-tactics RPG. In the turmoil-ridden Citte della Ombre, nothing holds sway except the Mascherines - masks that grant their wielders the power to channel the elements and cast destructive magic. The Mascherines have perpetuated a culture of inequality between the power-hungry guildsmen known as the Masquerada and the impoverished lower classes, the Contadani. One of Ombre’s finest sleuths, Cicero Gavar, was exiled for a crime against the state five years ago, but he is now summoned back to Ombre to solve the mysterious kidnapping of the diplomat Razitof Azrus. As other members of the Masquerada join his investigation, all having their doubts about one another within this culture of deception, their faith will be pushed to the limit as a deeper conspiracy lurks in the shadows of Ombre. 1 player 12GB minimum save size HD Video Output 720p,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

"75","2024-11-06","The canvas awaits its final brushstrokes. The stage calls for its lead actor. The novel needs its final chapter. It’s time to face your fears. One. Last. Time. The series that defined narrative-focused first-person psychological horror is back to tell its last spine-chilling story with Layers of Fear. The series’ crowning work is the definitive way to experience the critically acclaimed franchise as it features Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2, as well as all DLCs (including the new ‘The Final Note’ DLC that will give you a new perspective on the Layers of Fear storyline) and the never-before-told story of The Writer, which will tie everything together. Built on Unreal Engine 5, Layers of Fear supports Ray Tracing, HDR and 4K resolution to make the stunning visuals, and your nightmarish experience, as immersive and realistic as possible. Layers of Fear: Create Your Magnum Opus “The one precious thing you ever truly desired… FINISH IT.” Explore a Victorian mansion covered in artwork as The Painter, whose sanity crumbles and cracks just like old oil paint on canvas. Trawl through the ever-changing house to find the supplies needed for your greatest masterpiece, all while trying to outrun your past. Inheritance DLC: Face Your Past “I was once told insanity runs in my family… It’s time to make it stop.” Told from the perspective of The Painter’s Daughter, you come seeking answers. What secrets does this homestead hold? Will you ever truly understand the madness that bestowed your father? Can you ever forgive him? The house may hold everything you need to know... if you can face reliving your past. The Final Note DLC: Delve Even Deeper A brand new DLC which aims to shed more light on The Painter, his muse and the family’s backstory, The Final Note is told from the perspective of The Painter’s Wife. This additional narrative may change how you see the characters of the first game, as well as their actions. Layers of Fear 2: Hit Your Marks “Time waits for no one, actor. Do not waste ours.” You are the lead actor in a production being filmed aboard an ocean liner, but all is not what it seems. Explore the ship and discover why you were perfect for The Director’s (voiced by Tony Todd) latest film. You awake and are told one simple command “Act.” But will you? The Final Prologue The first expansion to Layers of Fear 2’s storyline allows you to step into the director’s seat and take the reins of a troubled Hollywood production. Immerse yourself into the psyche of the movie’s creator as you seek to complete your final masterpiece, even as the set around you descends into chaos. It’s up to you to direct the action and make sure that what’s in the script makes it onto the silver screen. Experiment with different takes and try to fulfill your vision of the ultimate horror movie, all while battling inner demons and external forces that threaten to derail the whole production. The Lighthouse Chapter: Link the Layers Enter a lone and ghastly lighthouse as the newest protagonist, The Writer, and discover a never-before-told tale which will tie the entire series together. What awaits you there? You’ll just have to find out.","2024-10-22","/game/109372","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/1818/6e7f7021450875d3e0d7b1aa7852aeb12739462ecc4dc654.png?w=200","9","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4176-PPSA07265_00-2590470597939016","40%","17","Horror","629.4","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/layers-of-fear","Layers of Fear","TRD","BLOOBER TEAM S.A.","2023-06-15","layers-of-fear-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","13","629.40","0","",

Play as Jeff and Debra, two small kiwi birds and the newest hires at the Bungalow Basin Telepost Office. With no hands to help them, the two must work together to jump, flap, peck and butt-slam their way across an interactive landscape of levers, buttons and bells to get the mail delivered on time. From the Dropoff Depot and the Shipping Floor, all the way to the Telegraph Desk and the Cassowary Coop out back, the Telepost is a well-oiled mail-processing machine...well, usually.

From swirling sandstorms and blizzards, to carnivorous plants and paranormal activity, it’s all in a day’s work for Jeff and Debra. Team Up or Be Your Own Boss: Take control of both Jeff and Debra, and test your post processing skills in single-player mode, or team up with a friend to tackle mailroom mayhem in online and local co-op modes. No matter how you play, you’ll have a little extra guidance from the Telepost’s capable staff – a vibrant cast of postal professionals ready to help your kiwis complete their tasks. Collect Stamps to Customise Your Kiwis: Coordinate your kiwis to get messages sent as fast as you can. You’ll earn Stamps at the end of each postal shift, which can be used to unlock new wardrobe accessories to customise Jeff and Debra, making them the best-dressed mail birds in Bungalow Basin. Get creative with hats, facewear, backwear, hairstyles and feather patterns – there's no dress code at the Telepost! Keep an Eye Out for Collectibles: All sorts of weird things have fallen into the nooks and crannies of the Telepost over the years, and curious kiwis can solve hidden puzzles to find Collectibles that reward special cosmetics. Experience More Mayhem with Overtime Shifts: And don’t forget you can earn Stamps from doing extra chores at the Telepost.

If enemies penetrate your perimeter you need to zoom into close range combat and beat them back, adjusting to a completely different perspective in the blink of an eye. Welcome to Jeff Minter’s Akka Arrh. This modern take from the fine developers at Llamasoft combines the intrigue of an incredibly rare Atari arcade prototype with a unique creative vision that delivers a wave shooter that is insanely addictive. Akka Arrh drips with Minter’s sense of humor, love of psychedelic color, and ability to create games that are a joy to play. Key Features: Pure arcade bliss! You'll be thrown directly into the action where combos, high scores, and survival are your only goals.

Start from the beginning of the 50 unique levels, or pick up where you left off to power through to the end. Accessibility! Sensitive to flashing lights or just not a fan? Not to worry, as there is an option to disable the more intense visual effects so that the experience can be enjoyed by a wider audience.","2024-10-22","/game/118249","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/2216/RR6HkCCpeYX65wLfl1vGsP6V.png?w=200","1","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0182-PPSA10084_00-3651066137094003","55%","0","Shooter, Arcade","157.05","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/akka-arrh","Akka Arrh","TRD","ATARI EUROPE S.A.S.U.","2024-03-07","akka-arrh-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","349.00","0","157.05","1","",

As a six-year-old, “El Hijo” must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn’t feel right and he plans his escape. “El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Using the shadows to his advantage is the core element of the game, as “El Hijo” will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that “El Hijo” must traverse to reach his ultimate goal. - Survive the Wild West through the cleverness of a young hero - Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world - Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless - Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles - Use an arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes - Inspire other children to join you on the path to freedom - Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/WYjKQ407XRGoyRypUoBZTrPI.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4539-CUSA17029_00-BASEGAME00000000","70%","0","Unique","174.75","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/el-hijo-a-wild-west-tale","El Hijo - A Wild West Tale","TRD","www.handy-games.com GmbH","2021-03-25","el-hijo-a-wild-west-tale-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","209.70","1","",

And if you’re feeling creative, there are plenty of other ways to end your enemies’ misery – hooks, lava pits, saws... no death will ever be the same again. If kicking corpses into a lava pit and adorning walls with blood is your idea of a good time, BUTCHER is THE game for you.

"70","2024-11-13","2048. Following the arrest of a prominent community leader, New York stands in disarray. Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as ‘Shard’ spreads throughout the underworld. With the city’s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city’s fate. Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to die… unless you decide they must. Key Features: Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it’s sneaking through levels or attacking head-on Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle A reactive story where the player’s choices have real consequences Stylized pixel art environments and characters Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley Gameplay: Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them. Tackle encounters in lethal, high-octane combat, or use your wits to stick to the shadows, utilizing distraction techniques and non-lethal attacks to reach your objective. Augmentation: Unlock cybernetic upgrades to augment your abilities via upgrade trees, and build upon your playstyle to improve your stealth or increase the lethality of attacks through talent trees. Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground. Reactive Story: Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld. Crush entire factions or convince them to aid your cause. Your destiny is yours to write. The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0311/EcTm14LTNjRgt0qM2gHT4502.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2520-CUSA23292_00-2988533598676746","90%","0","Role-Playing","55.9","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/disjunction","Disjunction","TRD","Fireshine Games","2021-01-27","disjunction-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","559.00","0","55.90","1","",

"68","2024-11-06","Paradise isn't exactly what you hoped for: it's infested with zombies! Thankfully, you can control them. Capture them and teach them to farm or fight. They will help you defend your camp while you explore the world looking for… a new paradise. Welcome to ParadiZe! Do you want your very own zombie companion? A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen! Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable. It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive… A destination with plenty of surprises Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive. Home sweet home Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. The more the merrier… You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable. Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you. ParadiZe welcomes everyone with open arms! Well?

Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages. The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him – but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible. Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences. As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them – and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain. A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's atmosphere.","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/1308/IcgCV6RNmA3I0BUG4vIhQJca.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3792-CUSA20539_00-SONGOFHORROR0001","60%","0","Adventure, Horror","559.6","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/song-of-horror","SONG OF HORROR","TRD","RAISER GAMES, S.L.","2021-05-27","song-of-horror-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1399.00","0","559.60","1","",

Brace your loins with up to four players to run ‘n’ gun as dozens of different bros and eliminate the opposing terrorist forces that threaten our way of life. Unleash scores of unique weapons and set off incredible chain reactions of fire, napalm, and limbs in the name of freedom. Features: The Broforce: Deliver your own brand of shock and awe with dozens of bros each with their own unique weaponry and special attacks designed to dispatch freedom across the world. Bro-Op & Deathmatch: Battle terrorism with up to four players in cooperative mode or sever ties with your bros and face each other in several bombastic competitive modes. Fully Destructible Everything: Destructible terrain opens up a slew of strategic options while the abundance of Exploding Red Barrels of Justice™ can literally level the playing field with one shot. *** Broforce Forever Update *** Broforce Forever, the long-awaited free update to 2015’s most patriotic video game, held back from freedom-loving gamers for a crime it didn’t commit, has promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade and unleashes a megaton of Kentucky-fried carnage into the face of evil. The final update offers an improved and expanded campaign with new unlocks, along with six new ultra patriotic bros, four new democracy-spreading challenge levels, and the ultimate expression of military might – bug fixes! The best way for a returning player to enjoy this is to play through the entire campaign again. And again. Forever. NEW BROS Harness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Seth Brondle, wield Xebro’s flying Chakram, serenade (and grenade) terrorism with the flamenco firebrand Desperabro, or become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer! If sniping is more your style, famed bug hunter Bro Gummer brings pinpoint liberation with his trusty rifle, while Demolition Bro’s Freeze Grenades put evildoers right back where they belong… ON ICE. NEW BADDIES A Bro only becomes a force when confronted with those who seek to destroy their freedoms, and in Broforce Forever, the terrorists are even more determined to delete democracy. Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice. NEW CHALLENGES Bros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards. Succeed and unlock one of four new flexes that can be deployed by any Bro, any time, any place. Just like freedom. ***","2024-10-29","/game/17638","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1206/ZBrZdWMpe8J5dHsXfJxWsGHr.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3643-CUSA03887_00-00000BROFORCEPS4","80%","17","Action, Action, Action","105","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/broforce","Broforce","TRD","Devolver Digital","2016-02-29","broforce-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","9","105.00","1","",

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. The game centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a shockingly enjoyable sci-fi action running game where the player uses techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action bundle and with it re-invents the running game genre.

"","2024-11-06","From the renowned development studio WayForward Technologies, Inc. (Shantae, River City Girls, Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp) comes Yars Rising, a 2D action adventure exploration of one of Atari’s richest, and best known classic titles. In WayForward’s experienced hands, the Yars franchise becomes an expansive mystery solved through 2D platforming action. Take control of the young hacker Emi Kimura, who is hired by a mysterious patron to infiltrate the shadowy QoTech corporation. Run, jump, sneak, and hack your way through challenges as you slowly unravel a complex secret shrouded in intrigue. Emi grows in power throughout her adventure, allowing her to retrace her steps and reach previously inaccessible and secret areas. Her evolving hacking skills are critical to solving stimulating minigames that reference the innovative gameplay from the Atari 2600 title Yars’ Revenge. The deeper into the QoTech facilities Emi ventures, the more expansive the sci-fi mystery becomes. A colorful cast of hacker allies help Emi discover her connection to a distant alien race and unlock powers unlike anything she could have imagined. Yars Rising celebrates the Yars franchise in WayForward’s distinct style of anime art, humor, retro game mechanics and storytelling virtuosity. Features: 2D Platforming Action: Emi must jump, blast and sneak her way past waves of robotic and alien enemies. Her latent powers are revealed as the game progresses, granting her wild augments and biohacks that let her reach previously inaccessible areas. A sprawling, interconnected map allows for hours of exploration Sci-Fi Intrigue: A seemingly bottomless mystery takes Emi from drab office buildings into hidden underground labs, and even to the farthest reaches of space as she uncovers the dark truth behind the QoTech corporation and discovers her own personal connection to an alien race. Challenging Retro Minigames: A series of hacking minigames pay homage to the original Yars’ Revenge, which fans love for its top-down, quick twitch gameplay. Stealth Traversal: Emi can’t always shoot or jump her way out of a jam – tense sections of stealth gameplay force her to duck into the shadows to hide from relentless security guards. Classic WayForward Aesthetics: With fantastically rendered 3D environments and an ensemble of captivating characters, the WayForward team brings Emi’s story to life as only they can. Play the OG: Discover the first game in the Yars franchise by playing WayForward’s modern take on Yars’ Revenge, accessible right from the main menu.","2024-10-22","/game/148928","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202409/0619/e010097507b0897f95166e054e591c6df330d38c6433af89.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/UP0182-CUSA47055_00-0141897958233268","20%","0","Adventure, Action, Action","839.2","null","null","Yars Rising","TRD","Atari Inc.","2024-09-09","yars-rising-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","839.20","1","",

The forbidden city of Akratya is an unforgiving land that cannot be conquered alone. Bind with fallen warriors found throughout your crusade and dynamically transform between characters seamlessly in mid-combat with the unique 4-hero party system. The fallen are individual characters with their own unique skill sets, combat styles, and rich history. By absorbing their essence, you inherit the fiber of their very being. Conflicts and synergies between characters greatly impact gameplay, so relationships must be balanced. Strong synergies may offer combat buffs that can spell disaster for the ruthless boss awaiting your steel and magic. Throughout combat, you will charge a sync meter shared across all characters. During an opportune moment, dispel your sync meter and unleash a devastating Morphstrike using the combined power of the bound fallen warriors. When faced with a formidable abomination, a precisely executed Morphstrike can be the deciding factor between life and death. The world of Deathbound has been lovingly crafted and influenced by the developer’s homeland of Brazil, a vibrant culture brimming with life, creativity, rhythm, and a rich history.

"0","2024-11-06","Cultist Simulator is a game of apocalypse and yearning. Play as a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories. Perhaps you're looking for knowledge, or power, or beauty, or revenge. Perhaps you just want the colours beneath the skin of the world. In this roguelike narrative card game, what you find may transform you forever. Every choice you make, from moment to moment, doesn't just advance the narrative - it also shapes it. Become a scholar of the unseen arts. Search your dreams for sanity-twisting rituals. Craft tools and summon spirits. Indoctrinate innocents. Seize your place as the herald of a new age. - Combine cards to tell your own story in a rich, Lovecraftian world of ambition, appetite and abomination. Corrupt your friends. Consume your enemies. There is never only one history. - Found a cult, dedicated to the Red Grail, or the Witch-and-Sister, or the Forge of Days. Recruit Believers and promote them to Disciples to serve as burglars, researchers, cat's-paws. Use your disciples to keep you fed - or feed on your disciples. - Unravel arcane, unacknowledged mysteries. Translate grimoires and glean their lore. Locate and pillage the Star Shattered Fane. Penetrate the realm of the Hours, and win a place in their service. Perhaps - if you are very cunning - you may even glimpse the Mansus. - Outwit rivals, investigators and the increasingly suspicious Authorities. Your own altered Appetites may force you to act abominably, but your Cause must not be stopped. - Transcend death with a story-driven legacy system. Perhaps your inheritors will complete the Rite of the Crucible Soul. Perhaps they'll find peace in a pleasing career. Perhaps they'll bring the Dawn. CULTIST SIMULATOR: ANTHOLOGY EDITION includes the base game and all DLCs - The DANCER, The PRIEST, The GHOUL and the EXILE - with new legacies, mechanics, characters, cities and endings: The DANCER In the occult cabaret that calls itself the Ecdysis Club, the distinction between pleasure and pain is as delicate and essential as the human skin. It is all that keeps us from making the very worst mistakes. Pursue a career as a Dancer at the Club. Determine which parts of yourself to surrender. Cross oceans in pursuit of the ancient rites that beat in the Wood. Consider the ascensions that open to you. Choose carefully. The PRIEST A quiet suburban parish needs a new priest. Perhaps this might finally be the one who shows them the Way. Though their doctrines might be considered peculiar, their faith cannot be denied. Follow the path of Knock and serve your Disciples, both master and mastered. What is mortification of the flesh, set against those glorious visions of St Agnes? What the pain of this fleeting world against immortality as Martyr of the Keys? The GHOUL A disgraced medium. A gallery without windows. An elixir which permits the most final of feasts.

"","2024-11-06","Cultist Simulator is a game of apocalypse and yearning. Play as a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories. Perhaps you're looking for knowledge, or power, or beauty, or revenge. Perhaps you just want the colours beneath the skin of the world. In this roguelike narrative card game, what you find may transform you forever. Every choice you make, from moment to moment, doesn't just advance the narrative - it also shapes it. Become a scholar of the unseen arts. Search your dreams for sanity-twisting rituals. Craft tools and summon spirits. Indoctrinate innocents. Seize your place as the herald of a new age. - Combine cards to tell your own story in a rich, Lovecraftian world of ambition, appetite and abomination. Corrupt your friends. Consume your enemies. There is never only one history. - Found a cult, dedicated to the Red Grail, or the Witch-and-Sister, or the Forge of Days. Recruit Believers and promote them to Disciples to serve as burglars, researchers, cat's-paws. Use your disciples to keep you fed - or feed on your disciples. - Unravel arcane, unacknowledged mysteries. Translate grimoires and glean their lore. Locate and pillage the Star Shattered Fane. Penetrate the realm of the Hours, and win a place in their service. Perhaps - if you are very cunning - you may even glimpse the Mansus. - Outwit rivals, investigators and the increasingly suspicious Authorities. Your own altered Appetites may force you to act abominably, but your Cause must not be stopped. - Transcend death with a story-driven legacy system. Perhaps your inheritors will complete the Rite of the Crucible Soul. Perhaps they'll find peace in a pleasing career. Perhaps they'll bring the Dawn. CULTIST SIMULATOR: INITIATE EDITION includes the first three DLCs with new legacies, mechanics, characters and endings: The DANCER In the occult cabaret that calls itself the Ecdysis Club, the distinction between pleasure and pain is as delicate and essential as the human skin. It is all that keeps us from making the very worst mistakes. Pursue a career as a Dancer at the Club. Determine which parts of yourself to surrender. Cross oceans in pursuit of the ancient rites that beat in the Wood. Consider the ascensions that open to you. Choose carefully. The PRIEST A quiet suburban parish needs a new priest. Perhaps this might finally be the one who shows them the Way. Though their doctrines might be considered peculiar, their faith cannot be denied. Follow the path of Knock and serve your Disciples, both master and mastered. What is mortification of the flesh, set against those glorious visions of St Agnes? What the pain of this fleeting world against immortality as Martyr of the Keys? The GHOUL A disgraced medium. A gallery without windows. An elixir which permits the most final of feasts. A gnawing hunger which cannot be denied. All reflected in the snow-coloured eyes of Miss Naenia, gentlest of the Elegiast's Names. Dig in cemeteries. Desecrate tombs.

Volgarr the Viking II is a hardcore, 2D action-platformer where precision is everything and one false move can spell a brutal death. Players of the original game will feel right at home on this relentless voyage, even with the addition of new power-ups, new forms of magic, new enemy types, and a chest-thumping new soundtrack. While the sequel delivers the same unforgiving 1980s-arcade level of difficulty as the original, Volgarr the Viking II also (mercifully, begrudgingly) offers modern quality-of-life options such as checkpoints, save states, and an undead mode. You decide how punishing your quest should be – but now anyone can be a viking!

As an operative tasked with fixing corruption in the timestream, you have been sent to the North of England in May 2015, where six people died in a house fire. Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event. From the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely. You must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates. However, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone? Ultimately, everything is about choices and consequences. Features Choose how you want to follow the game’s story. The complete narrative follows the six main characters through multiple decisions across multiple timelines and you can experience these in any way you choose. You can concentrate on just one particular character’s storyline at a time, following their choices across the timelines and then go back to the start and follow another character. You can approach the story like a forensic detective, observe the final outcomes of the story and then work backwards along the timeline – essentially observing the effects and then determining their cause. Or you can just watch things in chronological order, experiencing the timeline unfold as you observe and change the decisions that the characters face as the week progresses. Watch and change things as many times as you like Can’t remember exactly what happened in an event? Changed a decision and you’re not sure you like the consequences? That’s fine. Just pop back along the timeline and watch and change whatever you like, whenever you like, as many times as you like. Change the past to affect the future Setting up temporary base in the house mere hours after the fire, provides a unique perspective on events. As you look back through the timeline, past events play out in front of you in ghostly form, with the smoke and fire damaged house a constant reminder of what is to come. In addition, as you manipulate the past, the environment can be reset around you to match the changes taking place. Some new objects will appear, others will move around the house and the contents of rooms can change substantially as you change the past.","2024-10-22","/game/107312","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202404/2215/24af702899a05af24e9ea708cfbdf71c661794c4c5bf61ce.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7072-PPSA19317_00-ETERNALTHREADS01","50%","9","Adventure, Puzzle","349.5","null","null","Eternal Threads","TRD","Secret Mode Limited","2024-05-23","eternal-threads-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","8","349.50","0","",

"","2024-11-06","Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. Airstrip DLC It is more story-driven than what we did in the past and it allows you to build a small airstrip close to your gas station. Meet Joe Joe is an old pilot flying an old single engine plane. He is a bit strange and one day approaches you to help him with his endeavours. For that he needs a place to land in the middle of nowhere to make a stop halfway to his destination. In return he is willing to cut you in on his deals. The Airstrip You have plenty of space and as it turned out, there used to be an old military landing strip during WWII close to your gas station. Should be that hard to make it work again, right? You might even go a step further, order some aviation fuel and some parts for planes. A windsock wouldn’t probably hurt and some lights might turn out to be useful, since you will on occasion also need to help him land. Let’s see how things develop and what Joe is up to... The Plane Joe’s plane is like its pilot: old. It’s also simple. The most advanced technology on this thing is the LED reading light Joe uses to find his way on the chart. How hard can it be to fix some simple things on a small plane? And it’s not like you are doing it for free. The Gameplay The Airstrip DLC brings new game mechanics and content to Gas Station Simulator based on events. Unlike the content we introduced in the past, it does not require your constant attention, it is more something that happens every now and then.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/0811/b8f13605c8c28858ee9edb0a090601b63229b7a90f139710.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-0529173475105583","30%","0","Simulation","545.35","null","null","Gas Station Simulator and Airstrip DLC Bundle","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2024-05-16","gas-station-simulator-and-airstrip-dlc-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","839.00","0","587.30","1","",

An important, controversial topic presented in an insightful and detailed manner, Weedcraft Inc presents a challenge to those who would rule the reefer, offering a series of diverse scenarios and unique characters to work with (or around) as your budding empire grows. Whether you choose to hobnob with politicians, pay off the police, fight for medical marijuana rights or work the legal system, it’s all in the name of the sticky icky and your cutthroat corporate profits. Deluxe Edition comes with almost two hours of chilled beats straight from Weedcraft Inc, grinded and rolled by some of the top Polish hip hop producers. --- BEGIN WITH PASSION FOR MOONSHINE We love moonshin’. There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught! Get an Original Score and Digital Artbook from Moonshine Inc in Supporter Pack included in this bundle.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0410/e5bac608aebe1e0089d63e787a03d4b0cd9bd44f4cbf4d3d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA19736_00-0961940092495974","40%","0","Simulation, Strategy","769.45","null","null","Weedcraft Inc & Moonshine Inc Complete Bundle","TRD","Klabater","2024-04-20","weedcraft-inc-moonshine-inc-complete-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1399.00","0","839.40","1","",

"","2024-11-06","Embark on a journey to a realm overrun by demons in a new epic RPG from the creators of the critically acclaimed Pathfinder: Kingmaker. Explore the nature of good and evil, learn the true cost of power, and rise as a Mythic Hero capable of deeds beyond mortal expectations. Discover the Story Your path will lead you to the Worldwound, where the opening of a rift to the Abyss has unleashed all-consuming terror across the land. For over a century, the neighboring nations have fought fearlessly, trying to drive the enemy back — but to little avail. Now, you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel, backed by noble paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else entirely? Lead your army and challenge mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will leave you — and the world itself — forever changed. PLAY YOUR HERO, YOUR WAY Create any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset. Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle. FOR EVERY CHOICE, A CONSEQUENCE Your decisions have more weight than ever before. Your goal is clear, but you must forge your own path to it. Who will die, and who will live? Who will stay, and who will go? Make your choices, and watch the world around you change. A NEW WAY TO FIGHT Enjoy two combat modes as you slay your enemies – real-time with pause or turn-based. Switch between them on the fly, so you can always take things as slowly — or as quickly — as you like. The unique Pathfinder ruleset also allows you to perform advanced combat maneuvers, like mounted combat. Use them wisely! GATHER YOUR PARTY A cast of more than 10 unique companions is ready to join your cause. Earn their trust and respect, and they will have your back no matter what dangers lie ahead. And if you get on their bad side, well… Maybe it’s time to part ways. LEAD THE CRUSADE You will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of its demonic scourge. Take command of the crusaders and lead them to victory – both as a strategist, controlling the battle from above, and as a field commander, in a new tactical combat mode. CHOOSE YOUR PATH Explore nine unique Mythic Paths: obtain extraordinary abilities and shape everything that comes next. Your decisions might transform you into a celestial Angel, a raging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, an otherworldly Aeon, a rebellious Azata, a wise Gold Dragon, an insatiable Swarm That Walks — or remain mortal and walk the arduous path toward becoming a living Legend.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202404/0314/8a79dea36e354022fb6ccf11af1084899d860cce8c771730.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6008-PPSA15870_00-0475751594267531","70%","0","Role-Playing","0","null","null","Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition","TRD","Postmeta Games Limited","2024-03-28","pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-enhanced-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1399.00","0","419.70","1","",

Your kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner. Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen. And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter. A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests.

And if things get too tough then up to four local friends can grab controllers and aid the hero as player-controlled monsters, zombies, and bandits. The World Large, procedurally generated, and interconnected lands range from plains to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons, you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area’s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items. One must choose carefully though; every god has a different price and some become displeased when their rival is the subject of worship. Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians. Variety Scores of weapons, items, spells, and mementos are scattered throughout the world to find. One may acquire a powerful enchanted ballista early into one life, only for the next to yield nothing more than a couple of wooden clubs. Mementos represent objects remembered from past lives and change the rules of gameplay. You may discover a memento that summons spiders from enemy corpses, improves your stats while on fire, or reverses the effects of death. There are multiple paths to victory. One could be nimble and stealthy, charge in waving a hammer, raise an army of undead, harness a variety of spells, manipulate enemies into traps or flames, amass resources to acquire the most powerful items, or simply play it safe with a sword and a shield. The various characters simply offer different starting points, every decision is your own. Challenge No life is predetermined for success. The cheery graphics disguise a brutal and unyielding experience. Unforeseen obstacles will need to be dealt with in real time and even a regular enemy will be deadly if you’re not careful. To reach the end, players will need to demonstrate that they are able to consistently overcome these obstacles. Failure can halt or even reverse progress. As you accumulate experience, discover schematics, and defeat bosses you can become permanently better prepared to tackle future challenges. The choices and advantages a player has at the beginning of a playthrough will dramatically increase as they play. New characters, items, and bonuses are unlocked in ways that are only hinted at during gameplay.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/2711/594d0e532892337960f060de798e952ff115296f67d9f613.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6718-PPSA21627_00-0132056813808815","50%","0","Role-Playing","227.5","null","null","In Celebration of Violence","TRD","Dolores Entertainment S.L.","2024-03-14","in-celebration-of-violence-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","455.00","0","227.50","0","",

"","2024-11-06","Embark on a timeless journey through a sprawling cave system packed with treasures, creatures, mazes, and wits-defying puzzles. The great grandpappy of adventure games will test you and tickle your problem-solving skills as you unearth its plot and secrets. Through cunning trial-and-error you will crawl through tight squeezes, encounter impressive caverns, collect inventory, locate treasure, thwart dwarf attacks, all while keeping your eye on the score before your lamp goes out. Dust off your vintage Colossal Cave maps from the 70s, they'll still work like a charm. This is a faithful tribute to the original game design. Developed in the mid-1970’s by amateur cave spelunker, this classic text-adventure was originally crafted as a way for a father to entertain his two young daughters. Will Crowther based his design on detailed cave maps he’d made with his wife, Patricia, of the Bedquilt section of Kentucky’s Mammoth cave. Family cave exploration is at the heart of this game. Shortly thereafter, the code-prankster, Don Woods, discovered the game on the ARPANET and expanded the cave. He layered in more fun, fantasy, puzzles, and a vexing 350-point system. Years later, Don’s expansion became the most accessible and the definitive version of Colossal Cave Adventure. Enter Roberta Williams. She first played the game in 1979 and was instantly hooked. She spent weeks playing, taking notes and mapping out the cave, as it was revealed through the textual descriptions in game. Her mind filled with imaginary neon mushrooms, misty underground lakes, a snappy bivalve mollusk, and a noticeably absent giant. After achieving all 350 points, she was ready for another adventure – a dilemma in 1979. If it was another adventure she wanted, she’d have to make her own... In 1980 she designed and developed the world’s first graphic computer game, Mystery House. This groundbreaking game is considered one of the most influential in history, establishing conventions that have become standard in the adventure genre. It has been ported to just about every computer and console, played by millions, and inspired many other games, books, movies, and TV series. Relive the golden age of adventure gaming. Immerse yourself in a timeless, sprawling cave system filled with treasures, creatures, and brain-teasing puzzles. Transport back to a more innocent time. Experience the retro-cool of yesteryear's gaming mechanics, accompanied by an art style that harkens back to the golden age of adventure games. This lovingly assembled tribute is brought to you by boutique studio, Cygnus Entertainment. Ken and Roberta Williams are committed to sharing and preserving the spirit of classic adventure games. With its challenging and mind-bending puzzles, this explorative game will keep you enthralled. Explore 14 distinct regions filled with magic, hidden secrets, breathtaking views, and cave-dwelling creatures. Each area offers a unique and enchanting experience.

"","2024-11-06","Scorn is an award nominated atmospheric horror adventure set in a nightmarish universe. It is designed around the idea of ""being thrown into the world"". Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself. Every location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world. Throughout the game you will open up new areas, acquire different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to comprehend the sights presented to you. GAMEPLAY FEATURES COHESIVE “LIVED-IN” WORLD Scorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open - the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels. Everything has a reason and purpose - you just need to work out what it is. FULL BODY AWARENESS Players will experience better immersion being aware of the character’s body and movement. Interaction with the world is realistic - objects are picked up with your hands (instead of just floating in midair), machines and instruments are operated by grabbing the controls, etc. Scorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions.

As in real life, the business of bud presents plenty of opportunity along with a plethora of problems.

"","2024-11-06","This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game. TVs turn on and off. Planes lose radar. Radio stations can't broadcast through the static. In the small coastal town of Camena, unnaturally occurring electromagnetic waves are suddenly causing interference with electrical and radio equipment. Reluctantly, Riley Poverly returns to her hometown to investigate the mystery, but what she finds is more than she bargained for. OXENFREE II: Lost Signals is the mind-bending follow-up to the critically-acclaimed narrative adventure game OXENFREE from Night School Studio. Play it as a standalone story or dive deeper by playing the original – it's up to you. As you play, you'll shape every step of the story through your choices. How you choose to deal with the supernatural events at hand will forever alter the future. Your choices matter. Shape everything through your conversations and dialogue choices. Forge a deep friendship with an old acquaintance from high school or opt to ignore a lost fisherman in need. Your choices impact who Riley becomes, your relationships, and the story options available to you at every turn. Start chatter from anywhere. Use an all-new walkie talkie conversation system to chat with contacts and uncover useful insights about the mysteries of Camena. Ask for info, check in with the locals, or completely ignore them. It's your call to make. And, it has consequences. Stop Parentage. Five years ago on nearby Edwards Island, a few teenagers unwittingly opened a portal, creating a rift between realities and timelines. Now, members of a mysterious cult-like group called Parentage are deliberately trying to open a new portal to pull something out. Who are they? What do they want? Are they trying to contact ghosts? Tune in to the radio. Ghostly signals are piercing through the frequencies of Camena. Tap into the eerie sounds and static using OXENFREE's signature radio mechanic. You’ll communicate with the supernatural, manipulate the world, and travel to the past by tuning into time tears: unnatural fissures in the time-space continuum. Save everyone and everything. Your future was on the line in OXENFREE and those stakes are even higher in OXENFREE II. Explore, climb, and rappel across Camena’s beautifully treacherous landscape. Take risks and see where it takes you. It might be dangerous. But it could also save the future. Not only for Riley but for everyone.

"","2024-11-06","BEGIN WITH PASSION FOR MOONSHINE We love moonshin’. There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner. You will progress through main missions, you’ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises... If you’ll be prospering, you’ll get the chance to create and manage bases in five different regions, each with its own, more and more challenging missions. From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there’ll be a pesky agent who’ll want to work with you, and there’ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them.

The Tale of Onogoro takes place in a parallel world that is similar to Taisho Era Japan and features a new version of the classic Japanese song “Gondola no Uta” as the ending theme. The original version of the song was released in 1915, near the beginning of the Taisho Era. Singer-songwriter Rekka Katakiri, renowned for her work in various anime and video games, provides bittersweet yet powerful vocals for the track. In addition, on PS5â„¢ consoles: PlayStation Camera adaptor for PS Camera is required (no purchase necessary) go to Playstation.com/camera-adaptor; for the best PlayStationÂ®VR experience on PS5â„¢ we recommend using a DUALSHOCKÂ®4 wireless controller.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202212/2606/636uSsp8KfurNHW9CfnbfroC.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1177-PPSA12651_00-0905410032046997","30%","0","Action, Adventure","979.3","null","null","The Tale of Onogoro Soundtrack Edition","TRD","AMATA K.K.","2023-02-21","the-tale-of-onogoro-soundtrack-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1399.00","0","979.30","1","",

"","2024-11-06","Escape String is a 2D puzzle game set in an undefined time and place. A small humanoid robot wakes up in the debris of a landfill inside a large factory. He receives strange and enigmatic messages, from someone who apparently wants to help him. The robot's purpose is to explore the large factory where he is in search of answers about who he and his mysterious remote helper are. The player does not control the robot directly and in real time, but inserts movement commands above its display in order to tell the robot when it is time to jump, to crouch and more. It is therefore a puzzle game based on perspective: the player must calculate the spaces between the robot and the obstacles. The obstacles are initially totally static, but as they advance they will be more and more dynamic and varied. For example, we will have guard robots that will perform the same actions as our robot in a mirrored manner. There are currently 40 levels, with 8 types of obstacles. The real challenge will consist in finishing the level with the minimum possible number of indications (input) and providing these commands in a single line (string), ending the level while simultaneously satisfying these conditions will unlock the """"gold chip"""" of that particular level. The """"gold chip"""" will be used to unlock new skins for our robot. This title is therefore suitable both for those looking for a relaxing puzzle, given the non-dynamic gameplay, and for those looking for a challenge given its arcade nature. - Original puzzle game - Suitable for all ages - Many types of obstacles - Relaxing but with a good level of challenge - 40 levels, expandable - Original art sector - Skins for the character - No microtransactions","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0918/J74I6xtnTXOobXQ5SGU1zxnZ.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8151-CUSA37535_00-5946527224077423","70%","0","Puzzle","73.5","null","null","Escape String","TRD","7 RAVEN STUDIOS CO.

"","2024-11-06","Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom is a history-driven turn-based strategy set in World War 2. You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies. Possible alternate history flow - what would have happened if the Allies followed the ideas of Operation Unthinkable and went to war against the USSR in 1946? Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Advanced army manager - choose the composition of your forces. Acquire new units, upgrade or dismiss the outdated ones. Make sure that your forces have all the necessary tools for the upcoming battle. Real WW2 heroes - assign historical personalities to your armies and get access to special skills. Realistic 3D graphics - study the battle map and take advantage of 3D graphics, featuring volumetric terrain and physically-simulated movement of units. Attention to detail - game created by a team passionate about WW2 history.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0910/r28qdLdXatQ9aY1ux0GGRoQl.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA34476_00-8237173962609670","50%","0","Strategy","472.05","null","null","Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom","TRD","Klabater","2022-09-22","strategic-mind-fight-for-freedom-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","524.50","1","",

"","2024-11-06","A surreal and punishing world of black, white and red awaits as you challenge the void of Back Again, a hardcore 3D platformer presented in immersive first-person perspective! In this void, your only means of escape is to cross floating platforms arranged in increasingly complex configurations. Obstacles move in patterns over and around them, forcing you to learn their movements to avoid getting knocked off a ledge or halted midair. Mannequins surround you, sometimes navigating the platforms themselves or simply observing. Perhaps they hold clues about the puzzles at hand, or perhaps they are just like you. Either way, they offer little comfort. Back Again is an eerie tale with a minimalistic narrative and unsettling atmosphere intended to test your skills, question your psyche and reward your determination, all set to a unique and ever-changing soundtrack to suit the mood. See the story to its end, retrying each sequence as many times as it takes, and once you’ve built up enough confidence, choose Survival Mode to see if you can clear the entire game in a single attempt! Features: • Walk, run and jump across platforms in a harsh 3D puzzle-scape! • Navigate shifting obstacles by learning their patterns. • Witness creepy events and engage in a light narrative! • Get immersed with a unique ever-changing soundtrack. • Push your platforming skills to the limit in Survival Mode!

"","2024-11-06","Paradox Error is a surreal take on the scrolling platformer format, combining minimalistic black-and-white presentation with self-aware, fourth wall breaking design. Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they’re part of the stage. The title screen’s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player’s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you’ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you’re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward. Features: • Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world! • Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective. • Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive. • Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style. • Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1807/7dfibDJZKkgabUv92WYt1h7E.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2005-PPSA06061_00-PARADOXERROR0000","70%","0","Action","52.5","null","null","Paradox Error","TRD","eastasiasoft","2022-07-14","paradox-error-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","175.00","0","52.50","0","",

A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they’d ever seen before.

The Night Journey (2007-2018) was one of the earliest experimental art games conceived.

Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity’s last line of defense. Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF. As their different experiences interweave with each other, it is only then that you will reveal the full story and unlock all the mysteries of a Brain Punk future caught between technology and psychic abilities in SCARLET NEXUS.

"","2024-11-06","Paradox Error is a surreal take on the scrolling platformer format, combining minimalistic black-and-white presentation with self-aware, fourth wall breaking design. Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they’re part of the stage. The title screen’s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player’s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you’ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you’re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward. Features: • Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world! • Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective. • Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive. • Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style. • Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1807/7dfibDJZKkgabUv92WYt1h7E.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2005-CUSA27949_00-PARADOXERROR0000","70%","0","Action","37.5","null","null","Paradox Error","TRD","eastasiasoft","2021-06-08","paradox-error-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","125.00","0","37.50","1","",

"","2024-11-06","Timothy and the Mysterious Forest it’s an ""old school"" style with some modern-age ideas. A mix of retro graphics along with meta-narrative, stealth system and action combat with a high difficulty level. Timothy, a common child, wants to save his grandfather from certain death. The old man fell ill and he's now fighting for his life. Timothy, who loves his grandfather very much, decides to take a risky journey to the infamous Mysterious Forest. Legends speak of a magic mushroom able to cure any disease that grows into the forest. Timothy bravely begins his journey to find the magic mushroom. The game mixes elements from adventure/exploration games with puzzle and stealth: exploration, reading and keeping a slow pace is the best tactic. The high difficulty level is the base: Timothy is basically defenceless and dies with a single touch from enemies or traps. The world is full of ruins, graveyards and tombstones, caves, swamps and weird characters: every place is made to look wild, abandoned and dangerous. Except for Timothy's grandfather, most characters are often mean or clearly driven by not-so-nice feelings.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/1621/GxSFUAnK1bbIMBkNgWWsPRVc.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2696-CUSA25899_00-TIMOTHYPS4V10000","75%","0","Adventure, Action","41.85","null","null","Timothy and the Mysterious Forest","TRD","QUBICGAMES SP.

Progression in DungeonTop could mean two things, grabbing more gold, or defeating more monsters! Play it your way. Will you build for cunning, speed, or power? Your choices in the dungeon directly influence your chance of survival! There are shops to upgrade your cards along with ways to remove them and plenty of loot to add. Adventuring in the dungeon allows you to level your hero, find powerful weapons to equip, artifacts to use and talents to master. Build your unique fantasy hero by making careful choices on what to learn, what to discard and who to fight. The choice of hero class will affect your play style and spells, whilst the allegiance you choose affects what minions you'll have to fight with. There are scores of achievements, treasures to find, gold to gather and more than 800 powerful cards to unlock. DungeonTop will have you exploring a plethora of deck-building options for hours on end, continually finding new inventive ways to succeed on and off the board!","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0900/QVeJKe9HTiI9zeLSLK9qxIKb.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2696-CUSA25752_00-DUNGEONTOPPS4V10","60%","0","Role Playing Games, Role Playing Games","73.35","null","null","DungeonTop","TRD","QUBICGAMES SP.

"","2024-11-06","In Mars Horizon, you take control of a major space agency, leading it from the dawn of the space age through to landing astronauts on Mars. Guide your agency through the space race and write your alternate history of space travel - any of the agencies can be the first to land on The Moon if you make the right choices. Manage the numerous challenges faced then and now: • Create your base with launch pads, research labs, astronaut training facilities, and much more • Construct your own custom vehicles from hundreds of combinations • Launch satellites and crewed spacecraft to explore the Solar System • Run mission control as you solve the various challenges of turn-based missions to earn scientific advancement and public support • Explore an extensive tech tree and compete or collaborate with other agencies to plot your roadmap to Mars • Choose from five unique space agencies, each with their own traits, base, vehicles, and spacecraft • Create your own custom space agency You’re in charge of every element of the journey into space: success rides on your decisions. Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet? Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies? Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars. Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors. Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment. These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue? Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We’ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5277-CUSA18418_00-0000000000000000","70%","0","Strategy","188.7","null","null","Mars Horizon","TRD","Secret Mode Limited","2020-11-17","mars-horizon-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","629.00","0","188.70","1","",

Feel object resistance, surface texture, damage feedback, heartbeat simulation and more thanks to the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. SYSTEM REDUX Veteran Observers can dive deeper into this dystopian reality thanks to three brand-new side cases to solve. “Errant Signal”, “Her Fearful Symmetry” and “It Runs in the Family” add another layer of depth to the game’s story while exploring thought-provoking themes of a future that soon might become our present. On top of that, System Redux offers expanded gameplay, which includes new game mechanics, new secrets to find, redesigned stealth, additional neural interrogations, and quality-of-life improvements made with the help of the Observer community. Newcomers get the chance to experience one of the most thrilling cyberpunk stories in all its next-gen glory: boasting 4K resolution, upgraded textures, new animations, models and effects, and transformed with jaw-dropping Ray-Tracing and HDR lighting. WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects’ minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion. But remember, no matter how deep you go, you can never hide from an Observer.","2024-10-22","/game/82626","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4176-PPSA02117_00-8201964206903574","70%","14","Horror","0","null","null","Observer: System Redux","TRD","BLOOBER TEAM S.A.","2020-11-11","observer-system-redux-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","9","314.70","1","",

Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming.

Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open! Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don't worry though, you won't be alone!

You’ve heard the legends of the haunted mansion and its seven deranged psychopaths, each guarding a floor of the house, but you dismiss the warnings. As soon as you step inside, the door locks behind you. There’s no way out—except through all seven floors. Gameplay: House of Horror - 7 Psychos is a first-person, single-player horror experience. It begins at an eerie fairground, where an omniscient narrator introduces you to its unsettling attractions. As you explore, you’re drawn to the infamous haunted house. Outside, disturbing exhibits and surreal art hint at the horrors to come. Once inside, your terrifying journey begins. The mansion has seven deadly floors, each ruled by a different psychopath representing one of the seven deadly sins. Each level is a labyrinth filled with traps, puzzles, and unique enemy mechanics. Your goal is to reach the elevator to escape, but first, you must outsmart the psychopaths. The narrator will provide hints about each killer’s weaknesses, but solving the mystery and surviving is up to you. Every floor presents a different challenge, where you’ll need to use strategy and quick thinking to avoid the killer, solve hidden puzzles, and navigate the deadly maze. As you progress, the tension rises, and the puzzles grow more complex, mixing horror, suspense, and puzzle-solving in a chilling game of cat and mouse.

"","2024-11-13","The “Princess Maker” series pioneered the social simulation genre, allowing the player to act as a father who raises a young girl, and it continues to be popular to this day. Among the many titles in the series, “Princess Maker 2” is the most popular. This year marks 30 years since the original release of “Princess Maker 2” (PC-9801 ed.) in 1993. In this title, the graphics were newly redrawn by Takami Akai, who directed production and worked on character design for the original “Princess Maker” series at Gainax. About “Princess Maker 2” “Princess Maker 2” is a childrearing simulation game in which the player experiences being the father to a daughter granted to them by the stars. They raise the girl for eight years, from ages ten to eighteen. Your daughter grows up to be an adult through various experiences in the game. The girl’s dream is to become a princess, but a wide variety of opportunities await depending on how you raise her. What kind of dream will you make come true for this girl? Redrawing the graphics This title is based on “Princess Maker 2: Refine,” released in 2004. Especially important graphics were redrawn by Takami Akai in a style similar to the PC-98 version. The graphics are drawn in high resolution befitting modern game systems, with a commitment to quality in the details. Addition of an opening animation An opening animation by Yonago Gainax has been added to the game. The animation, drawn by a team led by Takami Akai, envisions the future the player will have as the “father” with their “daughter”. Knowing how your daughter is doing is the first step in raising her This title is a social simulation, so it is very important to always be aware of your daughter's status and use this to raise her. In “Regeneration”, parameters for assessing your daughter's status are always available, so you can check on her at a glance. Check what you should do for your daughter’s future, and raise her carefully. Message from Takami Akai I am deeply grateful to see that “Princess Maker 2”, which came out 30 years ago, is still so beloved by so many fans that we can release a new version. This time I was finally able to redo the graphics, which I had always wanted to do. Please enjoy the newly redrawn vacations and endings.","2024-10-29","/game/132727","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202406/1308/81e524d3afadcb0d92690e1c326658e8d25ecf2a8cddec4b.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6090-PPSA15242_00-PMAKER2RPS5EU001","20%","0","Simulation","749.25","null","null","Princess Maker 2 Regeneration","TRD","Bliss Brain Corporation","2024-08-07","princess-maker-2-regeneration-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","999.00","0","799.20","1","",

Take on over 80 levels across diverse environments that range from sunny desertscapes to mysterious midnight scenes. It's more fun than a cactus in your caboose! Each environment has its own unique challenges. Deserts have meteor showers (because of course they do), forests have fallen trees (what's a forest without a little lumber?), winters bring the freeze to your switches, and at midnight, well, you'll just have to see. And if the chaos of normal mode gets too much, take a breather in endless mode. No objectives, just you, the tracks, and an infinite number of trains. It's the zen garden of train management! Ready to dive into the madness? Take control of the tracks and show that chaos who's boss in Train Traffic Manager. And remember: don't fall asleep at your post!","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202406/1308/a4e40c774e7747634e1aafd024a5c0c6000b19fc2c763a15.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6290-PPSA19159_00-0667656521132356","40%","0","Strategy, Simulation","68.75","null","null","Train Traffic Manager","TRD","Baltoro Games Sp.z o.o.","2024-07-25","train-traffic-manager-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","125.00","0","75.00","0","",

"","2024-11-13","Embark on a thrilling adventure deep within the eerie Backrooms in our latest game. Your task remains the same: find five elusive bottles hidden throughout the maze-like corridors while dodging the relentless pursuit of the glitcher. In these dimly lit and endless corridors, the glitcher lurks, ready to disrupt your progress at every opportunity. Engage in a heart-pounding game of evasion, using your wits to outsmart this formidable opponent. Remember, direct eye contact freezes the glitcher for a short time, giving you a chance to slip away or move forward strategically. The glitcher moves unpredictably, advancing only when unseen or after a brief pause following the eye contact freeze. Stay sharp, trust your instincts, and stay ahead of the glitcher's relentless chase. A haunting melody signals when the glitcher momentarily backs off, providing a brief break from the tension.

You will question humans, elves, goblins, cyclopses, and other fantasy creatures using your powers of deduction to determine who to admit or deny based on how they respond to your questions and your trusty tools.

At the dawn of the 21st century, the conglomerate PROBE-NEXUS, commonly known as Probe, began reconstruction efforts in that eastern area. Colossal capital and cutting-edge technology were poured into rebuilding it. Skyscrapers that put the old high-rises to shame along with the world's biggest shopping mall and recreational facilities.

Control the land cultivation process, select the best employees, buy the most appropriate farm equipment, raise livestock and process the harvested crops. Various camera modes allow you to enter into a strategic view as well as to look at the world through the eyes of the employee. Respond to the changing weather and seasons. Create a greenhouse to sell crops in early spring. Buy new and used special agricultural machinery to quickly harvest and sell crops before their expiration date. Optimize costs and employ seasonal workers only during the harvest time. Accept challenges from neighbors to prove who is the best farmer in the area. You do not want to cultivate typical wheat, don't you? Perhaps you would love to have an orchard with apples, strawberries or cucumbers? In Farm Tycoon you can have more than 20 different crops that you can cultivate by hand or using machines, where each harvest has a precise expiration date. Before you plant your seedlings, first remember about the proper preparation of the land for cultivation. Watch your plants as they grow from green, fragile seedlings up to the state of flowering, ripening and ready for harvest. Do not forget about watering in periods of drought. If plants are not cared for properly they become ill, lose their quality and eventually die. On the machine market you can buy both new and used agricultural machinery. You have a choice between nearly 40 machines. Remember that cheaper, used machines can break down more quickly, especially when inexperienced employee operates the machine. Before buying your first agricultural machine, build a garage to ensure sufficient space to park it. A real farm is not just about agriculture fields. You can choose from more than 40 buildings, starting from farm buildings and barns to processing plants and factories. Has the plague affected your harvest? Maybe it is time to invest in a factory? Build a specialized factory to process what you have managed to grow. Produce juices and frozen food. Have you produced too much sheep's, cow's or goat's milk? Start producing cheese or butter, unless you prefer to switch your farm for the production of meat. The cultivation of plants is not enough? Farm Tycoon allows for breeding animals. Starting from the smallest such as bees, rabbits or turkeys, but you can also breed goats and cows. Be sure to provide them with adequate animal feed and skilled caregivers. Raise newly purchased animals before they begin to produce eggs or milk. Bees love buckwheat and colza, so create fields with suitable plants nearby. When the animals get sick you will need to call the vet, and if you want to breed your animals, you'll have to call the inseminator. Face variable weather conditions such as drought or torrential rain and collect all the crops before the first frost and snow. Look for a rainbow during a gentle rain or watch the lengthening shadows, changing sunlight and color depending on the current season. At any time you can enter the photo mode to take spectacular shots of your farm bathed in warm autumnal colors, or in a dark scenery during a lightning storm in the background.","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/0513/aa1e3008b8b5be3cc8120bc5b4c5157beab5645f3c2b4ebc.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1549-CUSA46014_00-CLABS1FT20231005","50%","0","Educational, Simulation, Strategy","1049.5","null","null","Farm Tycoon","TRD","PlayWay plc","2023-12-15","farm-tycoon-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","2099.00","0","1049.50","1","",

Not For Broadcast VR takes the gameplay, story, and gripping dark comedy of the original award-winning FMV adventure and brings you closer to the news than ever. Get a full view of the entire newsroom, interact with your equipment and punch, slap and grab anything that dares to get between you and the truth. We promise it’s so immersive you’ll feel like you’re really being electrocuted by your poorly maintained equipment! Egotistical celebrities, dishonest politicians, and strange sponsors clash on the airwaves. You’re in the chair to ensure that the show goes on uninterrupted.

Hand-pick the headlines… with your ACTUAL hands! Experience the lost art of inserting a VHS tape into a deck through the magic of virtual reality. Carefully position your “air-conditioning” so the news doesn’t overheat and turn spin wildly around your desk during the adverts (watch the cables, though). Plus, shake your fist in rage at whatever political ideology you don’t agree with (Or at everyone, it’s OK, they can’t see you). Frame the picture; frame the debate Keep the general public entertained with your editing skills, and keep an eye on those ratings. Make politicians look greedy or brave, make resistance leaders look noble or violent, and make news anchors look charming or unhinged. Who and what you decide to show on screen might change the course of history. No pressure. Keep it PG If VR was invented for anything, it was the simulation of pushing important-looking red buttons. Smash it (or gently tap it; it’ll work fine either way) to keep rude words (and other sensitive information) off the air. Keep the news safe for children and oppressive political regimes alike. Tune out the chaos, load up the ads, crank up the volume and immerse yourself in the dreams, fears, hopes and neurosis of an entire nation, all while sitting on your floor.","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/2109/bb4ffdb077e6352c3af40a553e17db31b97e201c4617cb81.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-PPSA08716_00-9490505870769070","50%","0","Adult, Simulation, Casual","999999","null","null","Not For Broadcast: VR","TRD","tinyBuild LLC","2023-12-14","not-for-broadcast-vr-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","0","437.50","1","",

"","2024-11-13","“You must play this. It’s luminous.” 5/5 – Eurogamer “It’s all so brilliant and unapologetically different from anything else.” 9/10 – Press Start “A beautifully written tale about loss, friendship and the ties that bind us together, set in a sumptuous oceanic post-apocalypse.” Rock Paper Shotgun Saltsea Chronicles is a new story-driven adventure game from the award-winning indie studio Die Gute Fabrik (Mutazione, Sportsfriends). Captain Maja’s misfit crew must heist their impounded ship and mount a rescue. Guide the crew across islands of a post-flood world known as ‘Saltsea’. Explore strange and wonderful communities, uncover a deep conspiracy, choose where to go and which crew members to investigate with, and chart a journey through twists and turns, difficulties and delights. A Post-Flood World Visit different island communities as you investigate the mystery at the heart of the game. This flooded world, betrayed by the so-called 'Hoarders', barely remembers a time before the Flood. They rebuilt on the ruins of what came before, and new talents and technologies took the place of the old. Many surprises await! Choose Your Priorities In Saltsea Chronicles you guide the entire crew through the story. As well as investigating the mystery of your captain’s disappearance, you will uncover secrets, create and resolve tensions between the crew, and add to your number as you meet others who ask to join you. Each chapter, you pick which island to visit and who to send on the expedition. Your choices will unlock different content, develop relationships, and give you a chance to resolve (and create) tensions within the crew. With a lightning-fast navigation system, you’re free to hop around the islands as you explore. Choose between short and snappy observations, or dig deep into conversations, exploring the islands across different times of day. Uncover a Conspiracy Was your captain kidnapped? Or did she leave of her own free will? Keep track of the mystery in Murl’s Log and collect records of your encounters as stickers in the Almanac. Different playthroughs will trace different pathways, with some dramatic consequences for your crew. You can replay from any chapter and branch your save file to meet new crew members, explore different communities and uncover a rich and gripping story. Themes From an award-winning and diverse writersroom – with experience in Young Adult fiction, film, theatre, poetry and games – Saltsea Chronicles imagines a rich world where communities have rebuilt in the aftermath of disaster, creating a new society of connection, resilience and hope—but one still troubled by the universal questions of how to live together through conflict and change.

Play as Ali, a curious and sarcastic high schooler who ditches band camp to go on a cross-country road trip. But this isn’t a joyride! Ali is on an all-important mission to save her family video store from the nasty loan sharks trying to shut their shop down. Swindle strangers, pickpocket people, and con commoners across a wacky America of the ‘90s. And – it should go without saying – lie to your mom about all of it. Choose who deserves to be conned and who might need a helping hand. The world is your oyster (and hey, pearls are worth a lot!). One Con Doesn’t Fool All Con people your way! Wear disguises, sneak around, eavesdrop on conversations, and learn how to approach each mark. Maybe you think you can make enough cheddar just by pickpocketing. Or seek out more complex grifts that involve breaking and entering, smooth talking, and more. It’s up to you to outsmart everyone and lockpick everything that stands between you and saving your mom's video store. A Coming-of-Age Comedy If there’s one surefire way to discover yourself, it’s by setting out on an adventure. Luckily for you, you’ve got the aid of an expert grifter to coach you in the elusive art of charm. But a life of crime is no laughing matter! Not unless you turn on the laugh track and make it a criminally funny sitcom. Get ready to talk your way into deals, hearts, and trouble.

Develop and construct advanced bases for protection Grow from a tiny outpost into an advanced, nuclear-powered fortress. Manage resources carefully and choose research paths based on the items and challenges you encounter on each planet.

Save AI survivors and build a colony together. A range of unique stats, perks and flaws mean every colonist has something different to contribute. As your AI colonists complete tasks they’ll level up and get smarter, stronger and faster. Best of all, you can assign tasks and orders to NPCs to do the grunt work for you and prioritize their roles based on those skills. Want to take a break from mining to destroy an underground alien nest? Let your colonists handle that for you!

A megacorporation named MK is using its power to control the population, and her community is in danger. She soon discovers that she has a gift of clairvoyance that connects her to Reverie, the realm of the Aspirations of Humanity: Glory, Bliss, Power, Chaos, Bond, and Truth. In this world, Polly becomes Harmony, an Oracle who has the power to choose the Aspiration that will ultimately rule over Reverie and restore the delicate balance between the deities’ world and ours. The fate of humanity is at stake. To which destiny do you aspire? DECIDE YOUR DESTINY As Polly, or Harmony, each action you take will affect both worlds and send you down sprawling narrative paths. See into the future and explore the consequences of possible choices in the Augural, a game board and visual representation of Polly's gift of foresight.

"","2024-11-13","“A Painter's Tale: Curon, 1950” is a story about love and resistance, an adventure game about historical memory. The bell tower that comes out of the lake is the last memento of the old village of Curon, flooded by the waters of Lake Reschen in 1950 due to the construction of a dam, despite the protest of the citizens. The plans for the dam started during the Fascist era, opposing the interests of a big industrial group to the wellbeing of the villagers, who were forced to leave their homes and pastures. The main character of the game is a painter visiting today's Curon Venosta, the new village built after the flooding. The painter is dragged into the lake by a mysterious woman and wakes up in the past, in the old village of Curon as it was before the flooding. Around him, the villagers witnessed the tragic event at the time. “A Painter's Tale: Curon, 1950” is not a documentary, but a tale where history and fiction overlap.","2024-10-29","/game/87985","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1716/c3aa68af3efef2665a3a84591b71edbcfaf06ad776f3c124.png?w=200","2","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4977-CUSA43337_00-0863458994340705","60%","2","Adventure","85.75","null","null","A Painter's Tale: Curon, 1950","TRD","FANTASTICO STUDIO SRL","2023-06-07","a-painters-tale-curon-1950-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","245.00","0","98.00","1","",

Life starts when you sprout, time goes by with every step you take, and you can set your pace at any moment. You live and learn: surround yourself with other turnips and interact with them to forge your personality. Your acquired strengths and weaknesses will affect your future interactions. Build your social circle by maintaining and caring for the relationships that matter the most to you, and run away from the ones that don't. You can adopt many radish-pets and spend your life with them, start a family and breed little turnips or live fast and die young. There are thousands of ways to live and none is correct! Just live as you wish! (and assume the consequences of your decisions when you rot). Living and thriving in social relationships is not easy, so Minabo - A walk through life offers collectible hats that produce different effects when worn. Easily falling in love, making everyone hate you, getting an elegance plus or even changing your life expectancy...

What would life have been if you weren't rude to that one friend of your childhood? What if you spent more time with your family?

Sow, water and harvest your own plants. Raise adorable baby animals. Milk the cows, shear the sheep and go on a truffle hunt with the pigs — all in fun mini- and micro-games. The graphics in Across the Valley have a fantastic hand-drawn style. The grass here is lush and green, and the sunsets are golden. Enjoy the idyllic countryside and relax to the sounds of the atmospheric soundtrack. On your farm, there’s something to do every day. Give your plants and animals plenty of love and care! They’ll reward you with a bountiful harvest. You can use your profits to expand your farm — your planning table will let you see it all easily. Features: Action Point Locomotion System: * No Motion Sickness! With the action point locomotion system, no artificial movement is done! * Each action point is designed carefully to have everything you need within the reach of your hands. * Like: Everything you need to shear a sheep is right at the shearing station within your hand’s reach. * Or: Everything you need to work on the fields is at the tool spot. All tools are in reach of your hands. * You can get to an action point with just a blink of an eye. No button learning: * Do everything with your own hands. No extensive button learning is needed. * To dig up a field, take a shovel with you and grab it with two hands. Then dig the field up like you would in the real world. * To sow out seeds, just grab a seed bowl, grab some seeds from it and throw them on the field. Automatic Micro Games: * Instead of typical minigames that interrupt the game, Across the Valley automatically starts and stops a microgame when you perform an action. * An example: Sowing out seeds will automatically start a “seeding” micro-game when the first seed hits the field. The better you distribute the seeds, the more plants grow. Once the seed basket is empty, the microgame finishes and your plants start growing. Stay busy: * 36 tasks (quests) guide you from the basics of seeding to going on a truffle hunt with your pigs. * Infinite orders keep you busy, even after the main game. Cozy mood: * Carefully composed art style that lets you enter a comic-style world. * A well balanced mix of hand-drawn 4k textures and programmed effects create the illusion of a hand-drawn VR world. * Relaxing, exclusive soundtrack that puts you in the right mood. * Upgrade your house to make it look nice and cozy. Until now, you’ve only played farm simulators — but now you can move into your own virtual farm.","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202307/2514/b3a4deb6448c50cab178e4b2388716fbb5ce5957d31347cd.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7208-PPSA13759_00-0692696073114817","60%","0","Family, Casual, Simulation","279.6","null","null","Across the Valley","TRD","FusionPlay GmbH","2023-04-05","across-the-valley-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","279.60","0","",

"","2024-11-13","Take control of the National Nightly News. With the nation's eyes fixed on your choices, it’s up to you to decide what gets broadcast. Choose the shots, censor any “troublesome” content, and steer the narrative as your country tumbles into totalitarianism. No pressure, right? Hand-pick the Headlines Not For Broadcast drops you into the heart of a darkly-comedic tale of televised chaos, where your every decision helps shape the fate of a nation. From ego-fueled celebrities to deceptive politicians and enigmatic advertisers - you control the public’s perception. As long as you can hold the audience’s fickle attention, it’ll be your choice whether to toe the party line or hype up the scandal. Will you make that sportsman seem like a national treasure, or an alcoholic disgrace? What about those scientists trapped in Dante’s Taint? Or that new boss at multinational giant Rymmington-Svist who seems to live a double life? Most importantly, will you help the brand-new government look benevolent, or is there something untoward about them that the public need to see? The power is in your hands to change everything, but you’ll have to decide quickly - the news goes out live! Craft the Narrative (and the Nation's Fate) You are in the driving seat of a multi-level tale about both an entire country and a single family. Being the architect of the nation’s future is a challenge, to be sure, but so is trying to hold your household together through the dark times. With multiple branching narratives, every choice you make resonates into the future. Will you help your spouse’s sibling flee the country... even if it involves breaking the law? Who are ‘Disrupt’ - concerned citizens or something more revolutionary? And how do you feel about your son spending more and more time with them? And then there’s Grandma... Can you afford her life-saving treatment, or should you and your spouse be taking advantage of one of the Government’s brand-new Transition Centres? After all, granny, there’s nothing more noble than unburdening your children! And then there’s your broadcast room - when it’s not overheating, it seems to be trying to electrocute you. Keep the plates spinning as best you can, but remember, whether it’s a newsreader who just won’t take it any more, naked streakers at the Sportsboard Final, or the ever growing threat of nuclear war... this show MUST go on. Cue the Ads Select your ads carefully to mould the public’s opinion. Why not choose to show only adverts for the companies you have shares in? Maybe that extra cash will help with the difficult decisions at home. Or maybe you’ll be selling dangerous toys to the nation’s children…With more than 50 hilarious ads to choose from there’s never a dull moment - even during the breaks. Endure the Unthinkable and Laugh in the Face of Adversity There will be smiles, there will be tears, even as the world falls apart around your ears. So grit your teeth, close your eyes and keep those cameras rolling - the people are counting on you. Long live the National Nightly News.","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0614/4bae72a32b61a34c6f3ee140dbb6c1a517668e8b79c861c8.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-CUSA30757_00-0742719842801524","75%","0","Simulation","175","null","null","Not For Broadcast","TRD","tinyBuild LLC","2023-03-23","not-for-broadcast-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","875.00","0","218.75","1","",

Kazemaru sucks the enemy's spirit out of its body, and by destroying that spirit, Kuuta can then claim victory. Enjoy an all-new, unique co-op experience by playing both Kuuta and Kazemaru at the same time! ■A different way to level up! Kisejima, where the game takes place, is divided into three areas with a variety of challenges ranging from fighting enemies to escort missions. The player can also level up by running away from pursuing monsters, like a game of tag, and collecting mushrooms that grow in clusters to purchase upgraded clubs. [What is ONI : Road to be the Mightiest Oni?] ■Setting: Kisejima Island The story takes place on Kisejima, a small island in the middle of the ocean. Here, it is said that the power that lies dormant within the local demon spirits can be drawn out by challenging them to trials, where ancient demons who were once defeated by Momotaro are summoned to battle. However, few have ever returned from Kisejima alive. ■Characters: Kuuta, a demon warrior, and his spirit partner, Kazemaru Kuuta, the protagonist, is the only survivor of the Demon King's army that faced Momotaro in battle. He and Kazemaru, a mysterious spirit that lives on Kisejima, team up to take on challenges of all shapes and sizes! ■Artwork by KENEI DESIGN Kisejima may not be large, but the colorful artwork by KENEI DESIGN, with its dazzling green meadows, looming forests, and plains of floating megaliths, offers a unique emotional impact unlike any other action game. Its solo creator has invented a mini-world in which each and every location is marked by its own memorable appeal.

"","2024-11-13","Welcome to Praslav, a cold Central European city that grows even colder with the coming winter. Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades. While most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go. You are one of those people. In-depths Survival Mechanics: Keep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point. Combat and Crime System: How far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are. Winter is Coming: Spend the last few days of autumn wisely – gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again. Expansive Story: Unlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav. Homeless, But Not Hopeless: Maybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own. You Are Not Alone: Is surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter. Claim the Throne: For over a decade, no one has been able to bring the many factions of the homeless together. The throne of the Homeless King has been sitting empty for far too long. Who will earn enough respect and prove themselves worthy of uniting the homeless? Will you rise to the occasion?","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1814/dqyOj6BeMDetJ9RSM8OQOzhw.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6075-CUSA29679_00-1040084594243406","60%","0","Role-Playing","262.5","null","null","Hobo: Tough Life","TRD","Perun Creative s.r.o.","2023-02-22","hobo-tough-life-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","875.00","0","350.00","1","",

Upgrade and build your roster of available Mechs from over 80 unique parts, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and playstyles. From flamethrowers to mega missile pods, fighter drones to rayguns, determining the right Mech build and leveraging its weaponry is key to conserving your resources and defeating The Swarm. Mech Armada offers deep grid-based, turn-based combat, where there are no perfect solutions to the challenges you face.

Restore the order in all dimensions, influence and determine the fate of the worlds, create and decide what will happen in the new Multiverse. Colorful pixel art aesthetics: each tree, bush or rock is hand-drawn, each enemy has dozens of carefully crafted animation frames to create a one-of-a-kind visual experience; Mind-bending science fiction story: Several multidimensional versions of Earth were suddenly merged together, shattering one another in a cataclysmic event known as the Great Shift. This event damaged the fabric of time and space itself, seemingly beyond reconstruction. You, a Herald, will join a secret interdimensional organization — Herald's Undercover Bay, or simply H.U.B., created by Dharma to remedy the aftermath of the catastrophe; Heated real-time battles: control a Herald — almighty hero created by God. Combine his powerful melee and ranged attacks to vanquish your enemies. Heal carefully so that foes don’t steal your remedy, use movement, various buffs, and debuffs to gain the advantage and defeat your rivals; Customizable hero: implant different organs into the body of your Herald to acquire unique combat enhancers and passive abilities. Gather and equip nodes and runes to make your Herald godlike. Express yourself, create a build that fits your playstyle perfectly, be it companions, throwable weapons, critical or DoT damage and much more; Crafting system: deep crafting systems that allow you to disassemble basic materials and create from received resources unique organs, weapons, gear and consumables that will help you to define your unique playthrough; Vast open world: explore distant lands beyond belief and meet their exotic inhabitants — merchants and bandits going about their lives regardless of where you go. You can trade with locals, recruit them to help you in battles, or even destroy their camps. Between missions, you can recover, gear up and rest in H.U.B. — a base located in a neutral space expanse between dimensions; NPC interaction system: decisions you make as a Herald will affect the fates of the characters you meet, as well as whole dimensions. •Heated real-time battles •Colorful pixel art aesthetics •Customizable hero •Vast open world","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/2310/NGDRpQl5xVFdjeKEzWmeQsVH.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-CUSA32425_00-6472011712820587","75%","0","Action, Role Playing Games, Adventure","139.8","null","null","Undungeon","TRD","tinyBuild LLC","2022-09-29","undungeon-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","174.75","1","",
"","2024-11-13","Sam is a six-foot canine detective with a love of justice. Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they're the Freelance Police. And they're about to save the world. It's just another day at the office when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the ""spinny thing"" they do with their eyes.) Who's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds. ABOUT THIS REMASTER In 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within. Now everyone's favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell. Return to the adventure game that was once called ""gaming's first sitcom"" and is today known as ""the remaster you didn't know you were waiting for."" With enhanced graphics, five new musical tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN's Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that you'll love to play—or play again.","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1517/6cR3MxF0nOi0WQxWQO4wa6FO.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5966-CUSA30837_00-8594065719104065","40%","0","Adventure","419.4","null","null","Sam & Max Save the World","TRD","SKUNKAPE GAMES","2022-09-28","sam-max-save-the-world-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","419.40","1","",

The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always sunshines and rainbows. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their emotional meltdowns and PR nightmares can spell financial disaster for your company. It's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of gossip magazines, super fans, and rival groups, all thirsty for a scoop on the latest scandal. There's a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's nothing personal, it's just business. ■Idol Training Provide voice training and dance lessons to the idols you have scouted, and train them to become top-notch idols.

You decide. ■CD Production Lyrics, musical arrangement, choreography, number of singers per group, who will be front and center? The players themselves will have to make the tough decisions, produce the music and CD, and then release it. Of course, watch how much funds you have before you end up in the red! ■Advertising Activities Your Idol’s work isn't just to sing and dance in concerts. They may appear in magazines, TV, or livestreams on the Internet. Take on a wide variety of media outlets to increase your fan base! ■Office Management In addition to releasing single CDs, you can freely operate a cafe, theater, general elections, program production, and many other types of businesses.

Be careful to not become a shoestring operation and watch your revenue! ■Complicated human relations Idol management is fraught with problems, such as scandals, media manipulation, and interpersonal relation issues between idol group members and outsiders. To avoid risks, form good relationships and aim for smooth office management. ■Fascinating Story The story is set in the Japanese entertainment industry, and there are many events outside the main storyline. You can even marry your idol! How this story ends, is entirely up to you. ■Free Play Style Free play with no storyline can also be used to avoid random events and love scandals.

Live a summer of dysfunctional love through branching storylines, twists, sudden changes, and a special mechanic where you choose which senses to use with your boyfriend. In these moments, you will learn about him, his personality, and his past, making you question everything. Milky Way Prince is a semi-autobiographical story entirely designed, programmed, illustrated, and scored by a young author, Lorenzo Redaelli. ""During my experience with a borderline partner, I thought that falling in love with him was like becoming part of a binary star system. It’s the rarest, most precious thing in the universe – but the closer they get the more unstable they become."" ""My idea was to create an immersive experience where the player is asked to try to understand the dynamics of this unusual relationship. The character you interact with adapts their behavior to yours – using academic terminology, they could set up “rage tests”, “love bombing"", or otherwise guilt trip you. The plot's branching storyline is guided by variables such as “submission” and ""interest” that fluctuate at each interaction.""","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/3109/LkJfZKSVEhP8H7WVTwUzyOAx.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4977-PPSA06752_00-1147686809756156","60%","0","Adventure","183.75","null","null","Milky Way Prince – The Vampire Star","TRD","FANTASTICO STUDIO SRL","2022-06-20","milky-way-prince-the-vampire-star-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","210.00","1","",
"","2024-11-13","The Hand of Merlin is a turn-based rogue-lite RPG in which Arthurian legend clashes with cosmic horror. Recruit a company of up to three mortal heroes and guide them in spirit on a desperate journey from Albion to Jerusalem. Explore a richly-imagined medieval setting on the brink of apocalypse. Trade with merchants, improve your heroes and unearth ancient relics. Search for the lost fragments of your soul, scattered across the multiverse - and save as many worlds as you can. KEY FEATURES: A Roguelike Experience Carve a path across the lands of Albion, Marca Hispanica and Al-Andalus. Will you take a dangerous route, risking life and limb in pursuit of a legendary relic? Or will you choose a safer path? Plan and prepare. Negotiate, barter, fight. Tackle challenges. Suffer losses. Recruit new Heroes. Earn Gold, Supplies and Renown. Be careful: your choices are permanent, as is death. But don't tarry - evil never rests. Tactical Turn-Based Combat Master the tactics of squad-based and turn-based combat to conquer both human and demonic foes. Your enemies will be tough and ruthless; make use of high ground and cover, set up ambushes and coordinated attacks, harness synergies between different Hero classes and skills. Non-Linear Narrative Enjoy a compelling story inspired by Arthurian legend, the Matter of France, and the history of Al-Andalus - with an unusual twist. Make choices in interactive encounters that change every time you play. Written by Jonas Kyratzes (The Talos Principle, Serious Sam 4) and Verena Kyratzes (The Lands of Dream, Serious Sam 4). Hard Mode Suited for only the bravest adventurers. Experience an even greater challenge with complex resource management and tougher enemies. Earn Essence with each run that can be exchanged for Blessings and Curses, adding temporary benefits and burden in equal measure to your next run. Dynamic Leveling Use Renown to level up your Heroes, and choose between a randomized set of new skills or improved attributes. But choose wisely! Select skills with great synergy and balance your party for the road ahead. Equipment Upgrades Seek out towns to improve your arms and armor, or stumble upon hermit artisans in the wild. With every day that passes, the world plunges deeper into darkness, and you will need all the equipment gold can buy. Relics From a peasant's humble luck charm to the legendary sword wielded by Arthur himself, items imbued with magical power are scattered about the world. Some you will be able to purchase from merchants and collectors, but others will have to be earned through acts of heroism - or displays of wit. Spells Rain thunder and brimstone upon your foes! Seek out and gather Soulstones to restore your power and unlock new Spells. Even if defeated, your spirit will retain all of your collected arcane knowledge as you jump into the next dimension. Alternate Dimensions As you jump from one parallel dimension to the next, history is reshaped. Different kings rule the land, changing the encounters, characters, and events. No two worlds are ever quite the same, and each journey will be unique. And should your heroes fall, remember: defeat is not the end, only a new beginning. There are as many worlds as there are stars in the sky. In each stands Camelot; in each there is a Grail. But there is only one Merlin, and his eternal burden is to stand against the horror from beyond. Each world that is saved is saved forever; each world that is lost is lost for good.","2024-10-29","/game/92277","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0131-PPSA04468_00-THEHANDMERLINPS5","75%","0","Role-Playing","209.8","null","null","The Hand of Merlin","TRD","tinyBuild LLC","2022-06-14","the-hand-of-merlin-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","22","262.25","1","",

"","2024-11-13","CAVYHOUSE, creators of Forget Me Not: My Organic Garden and The Midnight Sanctuary, presents their latest “Clicker-style Dungeon Agriculturalization Rogue-like Game”! Level-up not only your character, but your dungeon itself to score huge bumper crops of items and Magic Circles galore! By continuously exploring deeper and deeper into the dungeon, you can remake (agriculturalize) your dungeon, increasing your strategic efficiency and gradually transforming it into a bountiful and profitable farm in this extremely unique and original Rogue-like game combining elements of dungeon exploration and clicker-style gameplay. ▼ Story There once was a novice alchemist named Irene. Having recently lost her beloved mother, she decided to start her own business as a way to help take her mind off of her grief and become more independent. One day, she found a cheap secondhand dungeon for sale in an online alchemist shop called ""Mercuri"", and bought it immediately. However, if a deal seems too good to be true, well... The dungeon turned out to be full of strange enemies, which Irene must defeat before gathering items for her alchemy practices. Upon finally reaching the deeper depths of the dungeon, exhausted, she encounters a doll-like set of twins and the mysterious dead body of an unknown man. This is where Irene's dodgy dungeon murder mystery begins... ▼ Game System The basic game system is pretty simple: Explore the dungeon > Harvest items > Go back home and handle various “preparations” > Explore the dungeon some more. During the preparation phase, you can develop and expand your dungeon or acquire new skills for Irene. Learning new skills will allow you to dive deeper into the dungeon and fight against tougher enemies and bosses. ▼ Dungeon Agriculturalization There are two distinct “levels” for each dungeon floor: Farm level and Magic level. Increasing Farm level will increase the number of items made available; Increasing Magic level will increase the number of useful magic circles. Ultimately, if you manage to maximize both levels for a particular floor, you can then agriculturalize it. Once agriculturalized, the floor becomes a veritable paradise, providing large amounts of items and free of any enemies. ▼ Various Skills There are over 100 types of skills, such as Attack, Heal, Enchant, Item Management, etc. Each player can develop their own unique play style based on how they manage and combine their various skills. Prepare yourself well, go out and explore the dungeon, and level up both your character and your dungeon... It’s an all-new type of Rogue-like exploration and adventure!","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/1509/tew1iMYstcPik6SFqREgDbnC.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0122-CUSA29164_00-THESEALEDAMPOULE","40%","0","Adventure","297.5","null","null","The Sealed Ampoule","TRD","PLAYISM","2022-02-02","the-sealed-ampoule-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","595.00","0","357.00","1","",

There is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective. ABOUT Tails Noir is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation. Tails Noir is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person. GAMEPLAY Tails Noir’s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you. As Howard, you will: • Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth • Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be • Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver • Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss • Be a raccoon FEATURES Post-noir dystopia Tails Noir’s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It’s a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better. Stunning visuals The breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. Evocative and unforgettable soundtrack Original doom jazz soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab features an innovative combination of classic jazz and electronic music.

Sin Slayers: Enhanced Edition is an expanded version of Sin Slayers that includes all of the previously released expansions that include new locations, enemies, heroes, items, new storyline and many additional quests. Create, equip and lead a team of heroes. Each unit will have its own abilities and weaknesses, so plan your combat strategy accordingly. You’ll journey through stinking primeval forests, boneyards riddled with crypts and the graves of fallen warriors, and other places even the bravest adventurer would fear to tread. Battles, traps, and bizarre enemies... Everything and everyone wishes to take your life, but don't succumb to despair. Between fights your party can take their rest at a fountain, or while on the road in an old church which leaves its doors open to the weary and wounded. Travel every path and byway of the Valley, obtain new weapons on the field of battle or by fulfilling quests, gather ingredients for magical elixirs and resources to craft armor and amulets. If a certain item is beyond your crafting ability, ask the blacksmith in the Old Church for help. The best gear will allow you to challenge the deadliest monsters. The souls of many heroes were cursed upon death, leaving them to wander a dark and uncharted world, an afterlife reserved for sinners. Is this the end, or..? Gather your team. Equip them with weapons, armor, and amulets. Level up your abilities as you move forward. The Sin Lords must be slain. Sin Slayers features a classic turn-based combat system in the tradition of the best JRPGs, giving you free rein to pit your tactical skills against the wretched inhabitants of the Valley of Fallen Sinners. Steel yourself. Enemies are everywhere and you will need to make difficult decisions and face dire peril to prevail. Depending on your choices, the sinfulness of your team will go up or down. If it's high — expect tougher enemies. Whatever might be buried there, is it wise to desecrate those graves? Every decision you make matters, and on the road to the next Sin Lord you will have many opportunities to choose poorly. Every crusade against a Sin Lord will be unique as every location is randomly generated. Think you know everything there is to know about a fetid swamp? We promise there are new lessons to learn, though they may not be to your liking! Legends tell of a place betwixt worlds, a region outside time and space called the Valley of Fallen Sinners. A dense, preternatural fog lays like stinking breath over black woods. What cursed hordes await? Vicious beasts, damned warriors, the undead, and worse chthonian horrors, all with an unslakable craving for new souls to perpetuate their own unnatural life. This region is for the most contemptible cowards, those who died because of their sins and the darkness weighing down their souls. At one time, they lived as brave heroes across a multitude of worlds, and bards composed ballads to their noble deeds. Until the day darkness flooded their hearts and killed them. Now regret consumes them, but their souls will find no rest. They are doomed to wander the Valley endlessly, searching for rest, respite, an end to their torture. But they will know no peace until someone destroys the seven seals of the Portal of the Worlds. Only then will the gates open and the damned finally escape their prison... Truth be told, no one has attempted this before.","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/2410/05qiDsHGdwFR9NYctpc0t1mP.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6216-CUSA25429_00-7873955240527144","50%","0","Role Playing Games, Strategy, Role Playing Games","314.55","null","null","Sin Slayers","TRD","Artem Korovkin","2021-09-02","sin-slayers-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","349.50","1","",

NOSTALGIC JOURNEY TO THE PAST When they were young, the Actress and the Director were full of dreams and ambitions. Decades later, the Actress returns to the theatre, to once more become the performer, the audience and the muse.

Each performance tells the story of different characters, with individual gameplay mechanics and a unique closure. Be a robot escaping a factory or a little, boastful musketeer - every role you take is a medium for emotional experiences of the Director. GRAPHICS MADE WITH VR TECHNOLOGIES To separate the performances from the real world and put the stress on their artistic nature, we decided to reach for new, creative methods of graphic design. The plays’ segments of the game are painted using virtual reality technology.

Frostpunk Season Pass - a set of three expansions of the Frostpunk universe: • The Last Autumn is a turning point in the Frostpunk universe. Revealing the restless events of Site 113 and its struggle to construct the generator before the freezing veil shrouds the Earth, this prequel expansion broadens the Frostpunk universe by introducing a new environment, new Books of Laws and unique technologies, and presents a range of new buildings — all of which let you shape society and the city in unconventional ways. • On The Edge expansion tells a story of citizens of New London sent for a special assignment after the Great Storm. It not only opens a brand new chapter set in the Frostpunk universe but also pits you against new challenges and offers unique mechanics, both in the city and on the Frostland map - further enriching the core experience. • The Rifts allows you to experience a new level of challenge on a brand new Endless Mode map, where the land itself threatens your survival. Using a new gameplay mechanic, bridge the rifts to access new areas. Expand the city to save your people from the inevitable doom! ABOUT THE GAME Frostpunk is a blend of city-builder, society survival and a strategy game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and the present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202107/1311/4N4eGyrwGerDc9krtKnthKRN.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKCOMPLET","75%","0","Strategy, Strategy, Simulation","236.25","null","null","Frostpunk: Complete Collection","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2021-07-20","frostpunk-complete-collection-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1575.00","0","393.75","1","",

"","2024-11-13","This is not just another RTS, in which you are an invisible being hovering over the battlefield. In Radio Commander situation reports are given to you in form of dramatic radio statements sent by troops fighting on the ground. And your only accessory is a strategic map, on which you can place tokens and notes. Radio Commander offers an unique experience very different from classic real time strategy games. It’s a bold try to redefine the genre, as the player will be involved in a decision making process much more realistic than those pictured by casual RTS titles. Ask for situation reports. Listen what your men have to tell you. Send evac choppers and nape drops. Defeat the invisible enemy. Decide the fate of your soldiers. The choices you face will have a direct impact on the course of the game. They will also define views of your hero. Or maybe those are your views? Playing Radio Commander you must be prepared to answer tough questions about the righteousness of your actions, the price of a human life, and the toxic power of propaganda and stereotypes. Radio Commander includes: - 9 main campaign missions (every mission is possible to complete in several different ways), - 9 animated briefings, - 15 unit types, including: infantry, evac choppers, gunships, field artillery, aerial reconnaissance, M113 armored personnel carriers, and napalm-carrying F4 Phantom jets (every unit is described by a unique set of statistics and communicates with commander using a different voice), - full voice over, - over 200 dialogue blocks, used to construct radio messages, - over 600 story dialogues between units and the commander.","2024-10-29","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/1316/HwMgbPfNaI80QZxVvJvZamEw.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1549-CUSA25956_00-CLABS0RCM2020102","60%","0","Strategy, Simulator","210","null","null","Radio Commander","TRD","PlayWay plc","2021-01-25","radio-commander-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","0","210.00","1","",

If you are bored of waiting for fish to take and falling asleep in front of the computer, this means that you have played a bad game! In the Ultimate Fishing Simulator, this will never happen. Select the appropriate equipment and bait, cast your line and wait for a bite. Success is guaranteed. In addition to traditional fishing techniques, in Ultimate Fishing Simulator you’ll also find a winter map where you will be able to go ice fishing! Buy an auger at the store, find a suitable location and drill an air hole. But not too small, so that you can remove the fish. There are two modes of difficulties in the Ultimate Fishing Simulator, thanks to which there is something for everyone. Normal Mode allows you to enjoy the game in all its glory. In normal mode, all the features in the game are included. Realistic Mode requires more patience and efficiency from the player. Fish will be biting less and will fight longer. Some of the game features in this mode are disabled, such as the underwater camera. Every fisherman likes to admire his trophies. Some release their fish, other stuff and hang them on their walls.
