The game offers two story modes with procedurally generated worlds: Beat \u2018Em Up and Rogue-lite. Beat \u2018Em Up mode creates a larger world for you to explore with a more relaxed difficulty curve. You can revive your friends and the potions you find have useful or hilarious effects (or both). Rogue-lite mode generates a smaller world featuring steeper difficulty curve and permadeath. Some of the potions you find have malicious effects - you have to learn which ones to avoid in each run! You can play solo or with friends locally (up to 4 players). Key Features: An action-packed hybrid of Roguelike and arcade Beat \u2018Em Up. Unique Possession gameplay mechanic. More than 10 Viking Clans to discover and unlock. Each of the 7 Viking Classes comes with unique play styles and combos. Over 80 skills to choose from when leveling up your Valkyrie. Cute but bloodthirsty creatures will become your companions. Play against your friends in Deathmatch and Survival modes. And more!","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DieForValhalla_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/die-for-valhalla-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylIjo-qiK2Q","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"80%","genre":"Adventure,Action,Arcade,Multiplayer","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"17.99","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DieForValhalla.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"159","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/6084/die-for-valhalla-switch","RussiaPrice":"839","Title":"Die for Valhalla!","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Monster Couch","ReleaseDate":"2018-05-29","Slug":"die-for-valhalla-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"43.99","ChilePrice":"","Price":"11.99","MexicoPrice":"43.80","SalePrice":"2.39"},{"CanadaPrice":"10.39","SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2022-01-14","LowestPrice":"8.44","SaleStarted":"2021-12-30","description":"From the studio that brought you Master Reboot comes a first-person story-driven adventure puzzle game, set in the beautiful, haunting cyber-world of Elysia.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

If they match you take them from board, if not you turn them back over. MINES The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden \"mines\" without detonating any of them.

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"40%","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.66","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"30.75","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"112","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"7.22","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"39.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-01-14","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2021-12-24","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia. Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds. Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay.

Well, actually the Holy Grail is the treasure hunters' Holy Grail, but the WHATSIT comes right after it. And even Moorhuhn, the greatest adventurer among treasure hunters, cannot resist a hint as to the whereabouts of this relic.

In the depths of the dense jungle, the Moorhuhn follows the legend of an ancient, lost temple complex. Legendary treasures are said to lie hidden there, but above all a priceless treasure: the sacred amulet of WHATSIT! Hidden traps, bad-tempered gorillas, aggressive crocodiles, strange shamans, forest spirits, temple guards, bats, warriors of the dead and stranded aliens require all the courage and skill of a real treasure hunter. As you would expect from a proper jump and run platformer, you need to use all your physical strength, courage, and skill.
