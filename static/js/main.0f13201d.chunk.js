The story takes place in the land of Rin during the height of the Age of Sail, following the events that would lead to the greatest war in human history. STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin. POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player\'s party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history. CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character\'s unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle. PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total. This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for.","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"game?id=103890","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png?w=200","MainStory":"26\xbd","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4127-CUSA28517_00-R3PUS00000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8e4bk3jh0U","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"36\xbd","genre":"Adventure, Role Playing Games","PlusPrice":13.99,"MexPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/rise-of-the-third-power","Title":"Rise of the Third Power","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2022-02-10","Slug":"rise-of-the-third-power-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"MainExtra":"31","SalePrice":13.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"79","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","description":"Experience a dreamlike odyssey in virtual reality.

Take however long you need to map out your route, decide the best way to avoid traps, or how to use the elements to your advantage. A carefully thought out strategy is the key to escaping this dungeon alive.

The message confounded Orochi scientists. Their analysts broke it down and determined it was of intelligent origin. Orochi management immediately concluded that the discovery was too sensitive for public knowledge and moved to keep it hidden. In secret, the corporation began construction of Trailblazer Alpha, a state-of-the-art Mars research outpost designed to identify the true nature of the message. You are Shane Newehart, an engineer stationed at Trailblazer Alpha and your security clearance means you are completely unaware of the existence of the mysterious signal. Your job is simply to keep the lights on until the transport ship Cyrano arrives bringing with it a new team to take over your duties. Soon you discover strange and unusual setbacks. Crucial systems are malfunctioning, the greenhouse is filled with a strange mist and the rest of your team has yet to return from their EVA mission. Things are starting to fall apart. You begin seeing and hearing things that aren\u2019t there. Visions, hallucinations \u2013 or is that even what it is? Is this real\u2026 or are you slowly descending into madness? Experience true cosmic horror With your only hope of rescue hundreds of thousands of miles away, you will be forced to explore the real-world fears of isolation and paranoia, enhanced with supernatural elements and cosmic horror.

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike. There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series. This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians. Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields. It\u2019s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive \u2013 lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Just make sure you don\u2019t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies! The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front), with a new game Isonzo coming soon with mountain warfare on the Italian Front!

The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man\u2019s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn\u2019t for the faint hearted! Looking for more WW1 action?

Multiple virus infections detected... Launching DEVASTATOR program... You are the Devastator! Your objective is to eradicate 15 types of viruses in 3 unique modes: Quadrants, Sectors, and Cycles. In Quadrants, the wave layout is constantly changing as you battle increasingly intense waves of random viruses for 5 minutes. In Sectors, there are 55 unique waves of viruses across 5 sectors. And in Cycles, you\'ll battle semi-randomized spawning viruses across 5 variations of 11 waves. Complete your objective as the Devastator and take back control of the System! In addition to the main game modes, wave layouts, and various enemy virus types providing gameplay variety, Devastator\'s moment-to-moment gameplay contains surprising depth and subtlety. From the way you balance speed vs. firepower to the utilization of resources to knowing when to pick up powerups, Devastator rewards both fast reflexes and good strategy. Devastator features vector-inspired visuals mixed with HDR colors, five customizable full-screen filters and mesmerizing particle effects, all while running at insanely high framerates on high-resolution monitors. With modern graphics hardware, the game runs with ease on current high-end gaming monitors (such as 360hz at 1080p, 240hz at 1440p, or 120hz at 4k), and it can theoretically run faster at higher resolutions when better monitors and higher-throughput video cables exist in the future. Devastator was designed and developed by Luke Schneider (aka the Radiangames guy). Luke has been a huge twin-stick shooter fan since the 1980s, and has been developing twin-stick shooters since 2005. With Devastator, Luke decided it was time to make his ultimate and final 2D arcade-style twin-stick shooter. Devastator features include: * Ultra-high resolution and ultra-high framerates support - 4k 120hz, 1440p 240hz, 1080p 360hz, etc. * 3 different game modes - Quadrants, Sectors and Cycles, each with their own unique pacing and feel * 15 unique virus types to battle against * 55 unique waves across 5 sectors * Powerful power-up drops * Ever-changing wave layouts * Ultra-satisfying twin-stick shooting gameplay - that rewards you for your mastery and variety of tactics * Beautiful HDR, particle-laden graphics - with 5 unique filters and tons of customization options * Heart-pounding soundtrack and intense retro-styled sounds that enhance your experience","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"game?id=106158","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/1710/1gqL4Ug4yGbYpWNldzG2WD1a.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1249-PPSA03002_00-7506945076104177","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":2.79,"MexPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Devastator","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"2AWESOME STUDIO VOF","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-25","Slug":"devastator-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":6.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":3.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","description":"Embark on an epic adventure full of whimsy, wonder, and high-powered weaponry!

Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny. In Evertried, the player\u2019s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don\u2019t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"game?id=98461","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4127-CUSA28069_00-EVERTRIEDPS4US00","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImOYOo4RR4","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Strategy, Strategy, Strategy","PlusPrice":11.99,"MexPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Evertried","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-21","Slug":"evertried-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":11.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","description":"This little addition for ATOM RPG is mainly aimed at those, who already own the game, but wish to support our indie studio a bit more nonetheless.

Fight countless enemies with a huge selection of gun turrets (in the form of comic heroes) and additional helpers (mines, air support, block wall) on more than 60 maps. Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

This classic platformer, updated for PlayStation\xae4, features more rangs, more vehicles, more bots, and more EVERYTHING... in an open world Aussie Adventure. Throw boomerangs, bite, smash and glide your way around the Australian Outback and stop the evil plans of the wicked Boss Cass and help the good folk of the little country town of BURRAMUDGEE. This sequel to the popular TY the Tasmanian Tiger is a game on a grander scale. In addition to classic platforming elements, you\'ll fight Aussie bush fires from a helicopter, drive around Southern Rivers while hanging on to the back of a four-wheel drive and use the bots to defeat enemies and solve puzzles - all while trying to find a variety of different collectables. And now, only on the HD remaster, you can customize TY\'s looks, and best of all there are two brand NEW never before seen boomerangs. * Explore from the beach to the desert to the billabong and beyond in a huge open world of old-school 3D platforming glory. * Arm yourself with 20 different boomerangs including the classic Ironbark, Flamerang and two NEW rangs! * Brand new photo-mode. * A wide variety of vehicles like the Fourbie, cart, and mechs, too. * 7 Levels of two-player split-screen cart racing. * Improved camera & graphics; including updated shadows, reflections and HD resolutions. * New Gamemode called \\"Hardcore Mode\\". * Over 25 Trophies, including a Platinum Trophy, plus Speed Run and Time Attack Leaderboards. * Character customization with NEW skins for TY and paint jobs for the Fourbie! * Audio Director\'s cut.

But one brave soul stood up to CASS, and thwarted his quest for the talismans. He risked all, in an effort to save his family and friends. And in the end... he succeeded. CASS was banished for his crimes, and the land was made safe once again. All thanks to the true blue Aussie hero, TY the Tasmanian Tiger, and his friends at BUSH RESCUE. Now, evil stirs again - the little country town of CURRAWONG is under attack, and a hero is needed once more...","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"game?id=10738","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/2806/pNyCZEaU0ikDsYEtK4mLbOvz.png?w=200","MainStory":"8\xbd","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5452-CUSA26865_00-7582797769000004","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"15","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":14.99,"MexPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"TY the Tasmanian Tiger\u2122 2: Bush Rescue\u2122 HD","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"KROME INTERACTIVE","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-30","Slug":"ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-2-bush-rescue-hd-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":"12\xbd","SalePrice":14.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","description":"Hit the ball!

The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America\u2019s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2660-CUSA23291_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":8.99,"MexPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Disjunction - Digital Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-28","Slug":"disjunction--digital-deluxe-edition-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":17.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":8.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","description":"The year is 50 B.C.

The CURTAIN CALL Chapter is a Chapter for Dead by Daylight and it includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map. People often speak of the tears of a clown, of the sadness that lies beneath the greasepaint smile. What if that wasn\u2019t sadness, but a deep malevolence, born of a life spent in the pursuit of drink and gluttony? A mind that sees others only as vessels for torture, and reduces their bodies down to a single finger, a trophy to be added to a collection? For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on. Kate Denson\u2019s smile is genuine, friendly and warm. She sings of love and life, family and hope. She holds those values dear, and will fight anyone who tries to destroy them.

Later on, she tried to steal the sword called \u201cYoshimitsu\u201d from Yoshimitsu for her grandfather, who was a swordsmith. In the end, she was unable to steal the sword, and her grandfather passed away. She lost all desire to steal the sword, and vanished from Yoshimitsu\u2019s sight. Later on, she married a shinobi, and was blessed with a daughter. As time went on, her daughter grew to be a better ninja than her parents. She took on the name Kunimitsu from her sick mother, and accepted contracts from various governments and large corporations to steal important items. One day, Kunimitsu got a call that her mother\u2019s condition had worsened. She rushed to see her bedridden mother and heard the story of the only thing that her mother could not obtain in the past.

Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what\'s going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You\'ve always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don\'t get upset... you see they\'re not stuck there forever, if you\'re up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there\'s this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open! Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there\'s just this one SMALL problem. You see there\'s this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who\'s also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn\'t think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he\'s ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you\'ll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don\'t worry though, you won\'t be alone! You\'ll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie.

In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle.
