Music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to the Tetriminos themselves—pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you're playing, making any of the game's 30+ stages and 10+ modes something you'll want to experience over and over again. Plus cross-platform multiplayer modes for competitive and cooperative play! • Close your eyes to enter the ZONE With PS VR2 eye tracking enabled in the game options, you can enter the ZONE by closing and then opening your eyes. • PS VR2 headset feedback Transport yourself into the world of Tetris Effect: Connected where you can feel key moments in gameplay.

Players on different platforms can easily join Friend Match rooms with the new Room ID feature. • A wide variety of competitive and co-op modes! Among the new modes is ""CONNECTED,"" where three players can team up and literally connect their Tetris Matrices to fight against A.I.-controlled Bosses; ""Zone Battle,"" a one-on-one match of standard competitive Tetris, but with a twist: the time-stopping Zone mechanic; and ""Score Attack"" and ""Classic Score Attack,” two single-player versus modes where two players compete separately to see who can get the best score. • Join in on the fun in Spectator mode!

Embark on this definitive version of the critically acclaimed Shin Megami Tensei V, massively expanded with a brand-new storyline featuring new locations, demons, and choices to make that will dictate the fate of all existence. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance consists of two complete story paths: experience a brand-new route, the ""Canon of Vengeance"" – a dramatic tale of revenge by the fallen, centered around new characters and an enigmatic cohort of demons, the Qadištu, who plot their own dark designs apart from the war of those who fight to maintain order and those who seek to defy it. Or explore the original story told in Shin Megami Tensei V, the ""Canon of Creation"" – an eternal conflict between angels and demons, in which the protagonist fights for the world’s fate. When a grisly murder scene in modern-day Tokyo blocks our protagonist’s walk home, an unplanned detour leaves him buried and unconscious. He awakens in a new Tokyo, a wasteland ravaged by apocalypse now called Da’at… but before bloodthirsty demons can claim his life, a savior emerges, and the two of them unite to become a mighty being, neither human nor demon: a Nahobino. With newfound power, the protagonist ventures through Da'at, an enigmatic realm filled with mythical deities and demonic tyrants in constant conflict for survival. Searching for answers, the protagonist must forge his own path in a battle between angels and demons to dictate the fate of the world. KEY FEATURES The Definitive Version of Shin Megami Tensei V Fully evolved with stunning visuals for modern consoles, the dark lore, unnerving atmosphere, and beautiful and monstrous demons are back and better than ever.

Experience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs new paths you’ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons. Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble make for a visceral and cathartic action game.

Assume the leadership of a medieval noble family, increasing its power and reputation through the generations. As one ruler dies, they are replaced by an heir who may have very different abilities or interests, forcing you to adjust your long term plans. Play a master of the battlefield, conquering your enemies, or play a subtle seeker of secrets, using plots and poison to advance your agenda - all in the same game. Arrange marriages, champion the faith and establish new empires in this modern classic - unlike any other strategy game you’ve ever played on console. HISTORY Choose a royal or noble house from a number of realms on a map that stretches from Iceland to India, from the Arctic Circle to Central Africa. Guide a dynasty through the centuries, ensuring the security and power of each new generation. Gather new lands and titles to cement your legacy. Be a pious king to bring the religious powers to your side, or strike out on your own, designing your own splinter religion and earning everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Knights, peasant revolts, pilgrimages, Viking raiders... experience the drama and pageantry of the Middle Ages! CHARACTER Adopt one of five different lifestyles, perfecting your skills in military strategy or kingdom management. Acquire character traits that will guide your actions, but beware if you act against your nature! The stress from denying your truest self could bring a new host of troubles! Choose appropriate guardians for your heirs, or train them yourself. But what do you do if the legal heir is not quite up to the job? Violent characters may develop a fearsome reputation, cowering your timid subjects into obedience with the dread you inspire. WARFARE Recruit men-at-arms units and powerful knights to supplement your royal levies. Research new technologies to increase the wealth and military might of your realm. Hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major wars. Supplement your income with ransomed prisoners or raiding parties on neighboring realms. INTRIGUE Use your spymaster to discover plots against your dynasty and your rule. Recruit agents to assist your schemes to undermine or murder anyone who stands between you and power.

On the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance—as she speaks with the devil himself.

In This War Of Mine, you do not play as an elite soldier, rather as a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with a lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers.

At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival.

"82","2025-04-23","December 2021, Tokyo district court. Akihiro Ehara stands accused of groping a woman on a crowded train. A bystander’s video footage of his attempt to flee the scene and subsequent apprehension is all over the news, and public outcry demands a maximum sentence. “Three days ago, a dead body was found in an abandoned building in Yokohama. Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room. His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further. How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice? From just a single stumble, one can become a monster… LAW AND DISORDER - Lost Judgment once again puts players in the sneakers of lawyer turned street-fighting detective Takayuki Yagami. Joined by his partner, ex-yazuka Masaharu Kaito, the crime-fighting duo is called on to investigate a seemingly perfect crime whose lead suspect has an airtight alibi. What starts out as a tale of revenge reveals a tangled web of conspiracy involving several unlikely factions taking advantage of a broken law system. But as victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, he must choose between defending the law or exacting justice. FREEFORM COMBAT - Yagami’s distinct martial arts forms grant him mastery of any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Harness Crane, Tiger, and the new Snake stance, a graceful style that can deflect and return an opponent's strikes, using their energy against them. INVESTIGATIVE ACTION - Yagami’s arsenal of detective tricks grows with new gadgets, stealthily tracking suspects, and crafty methods of infiltration. Leave no stone unturned in pursuit of the truth. NO PLACE FINER – Immerse yourself in the bustling downtowns of Tokyo and Yokohama at your own pace within an authentic setting that only the RGG Studio can deliver.

"80","2025-04-23","IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY. Children of Morta sets its story in a distant land but copes with themes closer to our daily lives that one would expect. It is a story of simple emotions we all know so well and value more than sometimes we dare to admit: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Embark on the adventure of an extraordinary family of heroes. With the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil. But... it's not a story about saving the universe. It’s a story about a valiant family standing together while the world around them is being devoured by darkness. FEATURES: - rogue-lite with a strong storyline - 7 playable characters - local co-op - play as two Bergsons together against the Corruption! Additional controller required.

Become a master of the Living Ink, grab your quill and build your unique strategy time after time so that you can be named the greatest Inkulinati of all time! INKULINATI IS INSPIRED BY REAL-LIFE MEDIEVAL MARGINALIA 700 years in the making, finally these bizarre art pieces can come alive in a video game and show that medieval people also had their “memes” and that they laughed from the same silly things that we do today. You’ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more… FIGHT LIKE AN INKULINATI Inkulinati are a legendary group who battle one another on the pages of medieval manuscripts. They fight by drawing Beasts with the Living Ink.

Just remember - your opponent can do it too. ADAPT YOUR TACTIC TO EVERY BATTLE Each Inkulinati has its own army, with different Beasts, who in turn, have different abilities, strengths, and unfortunately, weaknesses (or fortunately - depending which side you’re on). But it’s not just the armies that can influence who will win any given duel. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. You will have to use your wits and adapt your strategy to beat the opposing Inkulinati’s army on each specific Battlefield.

Play as the #2 best investigator as you find clues, question silly suspects, and look at things through your magnifying glass. Some nay-sayers have called the magnifying glass ""useless"", but what do they know? In Case 1, The Haunted Island, a sloth has been haunted for weeks by a mysterious ghost that nobody can seem to track down. Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective. In the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbor has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbor is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer. In the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all... This final mystery is jam-packed with twists and turns, a true love letter to the Frog Detective fans. Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery is a family-friendly yet witty take on the detective game genre.

"77","2025-04-23","Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment. DRIVE TO SURVIVE It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows. INVESTIGATE THE ZONE The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you. REPEAT Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.","2025-04-08","/game/113597","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0710/516003921755aa5cb8873cb08c22b172141e997a0d5cd075.png?w=200","20","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6847-PPSA17476_00-00000000000PS5EU","40%","46","Driving/Racing, Action","629.4","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/pacific-drive","Pacific Drive","TRD","Kepler Interactive Limited","2024-02-21","pacific-drive-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","30","629.40","0","",

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You’re the perfect candidate for our test chambers!

"69","2025-04-23","Ganryu 2 is the sequel to the Ganryu game made by VISCO on NEOGEO back in 1999. The universe takes place in a feudal fantasy Japan which is strongly inspired by the story of Takezo Musashi, whose adventures are unfolded in a series of books (mainly ""The Stone and the Sword""). You play as Miyamoto Musashi travelling through a 17th century fantasy Japan, from north to south to the island of Ganryu-jima where everything started between Musashi and Kojiro. Story: After his victory against Kojiro, Musashi decided to meditate and try his hand at art, in the north of Japan, in the province of Hokkaido. During one of his meditations, a spirit contacted him : ""Miyamoto Musashi, our fight is not over, I am waiting for you to finish our fight once and for all! All of Japan will pay for your insult! I'm waiting for you Miyamoto Musashi!” There is no doubt for Musashi that the voice was the Sasaki Kojirō’s one.

You can invite up to three friends in local or online co-op, create carnage as a team, or compete in mini-games and then not be friends anymore. Get ready for another round of udder mayhem.

With the help of the Dragoneers, Sonia, princess of Astoria, pleads with Yuma to aid them in their fight to save their land from the Empire’s dominion. Typically timid, will Yuma find the courage to realize the strength he has within him?

"63","2025-04-23","A mysterious signal has been recorded coming from the red planet. The message confounded Orochi scientists. Their analysts broke it down and determined it was of intelligent origin. Orochi management immediately concluded that the discovery was too sensitive for public knowledge and moved to keep it hidden. In secret, the corporation began construction of Trailblazer Alpha, a state-of-the-art Mars research outpost designed to identify the true nature of the message. You are Shane Newehart, an engineer stationed at Trailblazer Alpha and your security clearance means you are completely unaware of the existence of the mysterious signal. Your job is simply to keep the lights on until the transport ship Cyrano arrives bringing with it a new team to take over your duties. Soon you discover strange and unusual setbacks. Crucial systems are malfunctioning, the greenhouse is filled with a strange mist and the rest of your team has yet to return from their EVA mission. Things are starting to fall apart. You begin seeing and hearing things that aren’t there. Visions, hallucinations – or is that even what it is? Is this real… or are you slowly descending into madness? Experience true cosmic horror With your only hope of rescue hundreds of thousands of miles away, you will be forced to explore the real-world fears of isolation and paranoia, enhanced with supernatural elements and cosmic horror. Terrifying visions and monstrous apparitions will make you question what is real and what is not as the very fabric of reality threatens to tear at the seams.

"51","2025-04-23","The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™ follows the Dwarves as they embark on a new adventure to reclaim their legendary home of Moria beneath the Misty Mountains. Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as mysterious dangers await. Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria—known as Khazad-dûm or Dwarrowdelf—in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there’s clatter, there’s combat. Excavate the mysteries of three legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within. Key Game Features: ● Feel the Fellowship: Experience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. ● Survive the Dark: To survive the treacherous Mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain. ● Base Building: Find solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to destroy Dwarven progress. ● Rebuild and Reshape Moria: Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dûm to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses. Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources. ● Explore: Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger, providing a unique experience each and every time. ● Co-op Multiplayer: Adventure alone or band together with friends in online cooperative multiplayer. ● Craft Dwarven Tools, Weapons and More: Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor, tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines. ● Uncover Magic Artifacts: Discover ancient magic items including swords that glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom. ● Mine Ore and Jewels: Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril. Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear. But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness. ● Comprehensive Dwarf Builder: Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator. Dwarves can be customized in a variety of ways to create a unique Dwarven identity. Then, during gameplay, players can find and craft armor and weapons to further enhance their unique style.","2025-04-08","/game/109177","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0520/d7bb0cab42052c1946d6fdcf236f059ee850819f9008843c.png?w=200","35","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7581-PPSA16618_00-0277621140622233","40%","83","Adventure","525.0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria","The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™","TRD","North Beach Games","2023-12-04","the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","48","525.00","0","",

"","2025-04-23","DEADSIDE blends your favorite Survival Shooter elements in a fast-paced open world where progression is swift and loot is plenty. Obtain valuable gear, and store it in a safe zone. Or build your own fortress in the wild, securing it with turrets, making it cozy while boosting your stats, and use it to store your vehicles and loot. Traverse the world by foot, car, motorcycle, boat, or a Quick Travel metro system. Make friends or enemies. Join PVP or PVE servers. Explore the vast open world filled with challenging events, and raid your enemies. DEADSIDE features cross-platform support between consoles. PVP, PVE, RAIDING We have 3 main types of servers in DEADSIDE 1.0: PVP, PVE, and PVP scheduled raids Note on all 3 types of servers your player disappears when offline with all loot on your body PVP servers provide an intense hardcore experience where players can engage in fights, and can raid each other’s bases with no limits. PVE servers are a more chill experience where you can interact with other players, and can’t fight each other or raid/steal each other’s bases. We recommend this mode to learn the game’s mechanics. PVP scheduled raids have specific times on the server when raiding is allowed BASE BUILDING AND COMFORT SYSTEM Build a secluded shack or a secured fortress. We made it easy to build with an intuitive tool, and added plenty of comfort items which are useful for gameplay boosts. Secure your base with passive defenses such as turrets and traps. Store your vehicles, and keep your hard earned loot safe from raiders. THE WORLD OF DEADSIDE Explore the forests, rivers, and settlements of this post-soviet apocalypse. You can build anywhere outside of settlements. Challenging NPCs patrol the map, and your progression is solely decided by your own skill. There are no levels or bars. Your level is your skill and the equipment you acquire. VEHICLES AND FAST TRAVEL Nobody likes running forever in open world survival games.

Apply first aid and transport the seriously injured to hospital. Every second counts! Developed by the creators of the groundbreaking Police Simulator: Patrol Officers, Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator is the first simulation game in which you experience every aspect of a paramedic’s life. Your objective? Quickly reach the accident site at the wheel of your ambulance. Your mission? Take care of the injured and apply first aid. Each accident is different. It's up to you to adapt and make the right choices while being fast and efficient. Welcome to San Pelícano You have devoted yourself to saving the lives of the people on the West Coast of the United States. The city is comprised of 3 diverse Districts containing a variety of environments, including historic quarters, the business districts and industrial zones. Each neighborhood is different and can be the site of everyday accidents or major events. The citizens of San Pelícano have daily habits and activities, any of which can lead to new types of incidents. Sound the sirens As soon as dispatch calls the alarm, you must race to your ambulance, turn on your siren, and race to the site of the accident as quickly as possible. It will take all your driving skills to navigate the crowded streets and find the best route. Time is of the essence! Save lives Once you reach the site of the accident, you must carefully analyze the situation to precisely determine the right treatment for each patient. Speak with them to learn about the circumstances of the accident and perform various necessary checks using the many instruments you have available and determine your initial diagnosis. Patients may react poorly to your methods if they have allergies, and some pre- existing conditions may complicate the treatment of otherwise simple issues. Most severe cases will then need to be moved into the ambulance and transported to the nearest hospital as quickly as possible. As you build your reputation, you will be assigned to new districts which have thrilling new situations and unlock new tools will be available in your ambulance. Stay resolute in the face of adversity Catastrophic events may occur during your shifts and you must rise to the occasion. During these extraordinary situations, the number of victims increase exponentially. Methodically examine your patients and triage their care according to the severity of their injuries. You will be confronted by moral dilemmas which will directly impact your patients' chances of survival. You will be responsible for difficult decisions—Try as you might, there will be times you can’t save everyone. Can you handle the pressure? - Explore 3 unique districts and intervene at the scene of the accidents, sometimes major catastrophes, that can occur there - Drive ambulances with specific driving styles - Adapt the way you drive in heavy and realistic street traffic - 36 different complaints, from simple daily cuts to 3rd degree burns caused by an exploding petrol station - 17 medical instruments at your disposal, including a stethoscope and oxygen mask - Procedures that are realistic and recorded in a manual - 2 game modes: Simulation mode for experienced paramedics or classic mode to guide you through your first shifts","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/1314/f432ab2e8e75a356fd49c390faef18ff3c63bcdc8fc500b7.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA15528_00-ALAPS00000000000","25%","0","Simulation, Driving/Racing","979.3","null","null","Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator","TRD","NACON SA","2025-02-06","ambulance-life-a-paramedic-simulator-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1399.00","0","1049.25","0","",

Navigate dangerous waters, unleash mythical sea creatures, and outwit enemies as you chase legendary treasure and confront dark secrets. ● Embark on a journey of loyalty, betrayal, and revenge, as you unravel the mysteries of the Sea Shepherd prophecy and face the immortal Captain Blackbone. ● Use your Pirate Cave (HUB) to equip ship upgrades & crew members before each run. ● Each run generates new encounters, requiring careful navigation as you work your way toward Captain Blackbone. ● Enjoy a rich, story-driven adventure across 3 acts, with endless replayability. Recruit and grow your pirate crew, discovering their hidden potential as you lead them into battle. It's your responsibility to mold them into the legendary pirates they were destined to be. ● Recruit from 6 unique classes, each with distinct abilities and playstyles for your ship’s crew. ● After each run, upgrade your crew’s skills to increase their effectiveness. ● Damage persists across runs, requiring you to swap out crew members to allow them time to heal. Face new challenges as the game world shifts procedurally with each run, offering fresh secrets, combat scenarios, and treasures to discover. ● Encounters feature diverse pirate factions and enemy types—choose your battles wisely. ● Your crew will engage enemies on ships and land alike. ● Visit shops to heal, upgrade crew, buy cannons, and repair your ship. ● You can extort shops for loot, but it’ll lead to a fight. Customize your naval encounters with cannons and ship artillery. Unleash powerful shots during naval combat to destroy enemy ship modules and gain the upper hand in boarding fights. ● Encounters begin with Sea Battles where you can use cannons to target key areas of enemy ships. ● Both your ship and the enemy's have distinct buffs that can be destroyed. ● Crew members can be targeted and killed during battle, so defend your ship and crew before boarding. Experience a fresh take on turn-based tactical combat that replicates the visceral intensity of cloak-and-dagger duels. Use the environment to gain the upper hand like never before. ● The boarding phase involves hand-to-hand combat where your crew faces off against enemies. ● Use your crew's unique abilities to maneuver and pin enemies against obstacles for fatal damage. ● Leverage the environment by pushing enemies into spikes, grabbing one-time weapons, or swinging into position with ropes. Legendary sea creatures, once thought to be myths, roam the oceans of Rogue Waters. Free them from captivity and gain their trust to summon them in battle. Summon 3 sea monsters to assist in the boarding phase: ● The Kraken crushes nearby enemies. ● The Mermaid disrupts and pushes enemies in any direction. ● The Giant Snail drops a deadly spiked obstacle on the deck. Each run resets your equipment and items, but unlocks permanent upgrades for your crew, ship, and Captain Cutter, allowing you to grow stronger with every battle. Items and upgrades reset between each run: ● Personal items (character equipment): additional weapons, attack modifiers, and side upgrades for abilities. ● Shipboard weapons (cannons and similar items): each new run begins with a usable, basic starter set. ● Ship modules reset as well.

"","2025-04-23","Soul Searching is a narrative survival game about sailing away from your homeland. You sail on your small primitive boat to a world of islands, dragons, and magic. You can learn about stories of people living on islands you chose to visit, discover dragons, catch fish, customize your boats, find ghosts, cast magic spells, and more. Soul Searching leaves you in an open world without any tutorialization except telling you the buttons to play. There is not one correct path. There are a number of play styles you can choose, depending on your hunger for gold and better boats. You might get lost, but it won’t take too long to find your way to the end. Soul Searching is about growing up, leaving your homeland, standing on your own feet. It deals with themes like isolation, searching for meaning and direction, leading to depression and suicidal thoughts. As the player, you are not a violent hero. The most violent thing you can do in this game is to catch fish to feed yourself. Other than that, it’s a game of humble survival and peaceful travels. But in that humbleness you are challenged to survive in a world of merciless dragons and endless seas. Made by a one man team spanning 3 years of development, Soul Searching is a very personal game. It tries exciting story-telling methods to convey feelings rarely conveyed in games. Since all code, art, music, everything is made by one person, it offers a special sense of authorship hard to find in other games. Other than the single player story mode, game also offers a randomly generated mode from 1 to 4 local players. This offers replay value and requires players to work together to survive. More players, more need for resources, so more challenge, but more skills to survive. Soul Searching invites you to its world of mysteries. Even though the main story play time is not that long, if you want to unlock every achievement in the game, you will have to get lost in this world. Features: - Around 3 hours of single player story mode - Random mode from 1 to 4 players that randomly generates a map and requires players to work together to survive - Creatures at sea: dragons, killer whales, and more - Islands with lots of monologues, and other islands that are not populated by humans - Magic skills that let you survive on sea more easily - Player appearance customization (including gender and sexual interest customization) - Day night cycle that affects gameplay in subtle ways - Extensive soundtrack","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202410/2314/db243c43109b7329f32e75e8a0a9590dd3d6beafe753437a.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/UP7939-CUSA51727_00-0989797555221988","45%","0","Adventure, Role Playing Games, Unique","157.5","null","null","Soul Searching","TRD","NAİSU OYUN YAZILIM SANAYİ TİCARET LİMİTED ŞİRKETİ","2025-01-29","soul-searching-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","315.00","0","173.25","1","",

Play as Brynn, a young but fearless Weaver, determined to recover her people’s cultural home in the debut fantasy action-adventure title from Yellow Brick Games, a new independent studio founded by industry veterans. Armed with powerful magical abilities and an arsenal of magical weapons, face enemies that range from humanoid constructs to towering beasts. Use the environment and temperature to your advantage in battles against a diverse roster of fantastical creatures, like turning a dragon’s fiery breath against ice-covered minions. Climb every surface and use arcane skills to create new paths. Explore the world in pursuit of the Enclave’s lost mysteries and challenge giant titans on your journey. THE WORLD IS YOUR WEAPON At the heart of Eternal Strands beats a revolutionary new system for gameplay interactions: heat spreads, cold chills, and real-time destruction allows for unprecedented reactivity in combat. Hurl burning tree trunks at enemies with telekinetic, snap nearby trees to block opposing fire, or channel raw telekinetic force to rip boulders from the ground. WEAVER OF MAGIC Wear the Mantle, a magical cloak that channels raw magic into raging flame, chilling ice, and telekinetic force. Combine your growing array of powers with enchanted weapons and armor crafted from slain enemies to create a custom look and style. Block incoming attacks with a wall of magical ice, lash out waves of flame from a massive two-handed blade, or toss enemies off a cliff with raw force. STAND AGAINST GIANTS Face gigantic adversaries and defeat them through a mix of sword, spell, and mobility. Leap onto and climb their massive forms to attack from different angles. Shatter armor or slice at weak spots to diminish their protection. Use ice to pin limbs of a towering foe, arcane flames to burn their fur, or catch lobbed projectiles and turn their attacks back upon them in battles that will leave scars upon the land. UNSTABLE CLIMATE TO MASTER Enhance the effectiveness of your ice abilities during a flash freeze to open up new paths. Use a heatwave to start a wildfire and watch it spread towards enemies as it consumes the tinder-dry trees and grass around it. A WORLD RICH WITH SECRETS Explore the wilds, the capital city of Dynevron, and the secrets beneath as every surface is climbable. Magical abilities can create bridges, burn barriers, or launch Brynn across the world. The next-generation physics system encourages and rewards player creativity in exploration as much as combat. As the Enclave’s secrets unfold, return to base camp to consult with a rich cast of characters. Each are keen to discover the mysteries of what happened to this lost bastion of power and knowledge.

"","2025-04-23","The Stone of Madness is a real-time tactical stealth game set in an 18th-century Spanish Monastery. Located in the Pyrenees, this time-worn Jesuit monastery is home to a madhouse and an inquisitorial prison. Five prisoners - plagued by cruel punishment, madness, and despair - pool their skills and resources to face their phobias, stave off insanity, uncover the mysteries of the Monastery, and find a way to escape. Escape the Monastery Escaping such a well-guarded monastery is no easy task, but Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo are determined to see it through. Alternate control of all five characters and use their unique upgradable skills to cast spells, assassinate targets, distract enemies, stun evil spirits, explore hard-to-reach areas, and more. Explore your surroundings and combine the characters’ abilities to find clues and tools scattered throughout the monastery. Be careful though, if you’re caught being somewhere you shouldn’t be, the guards will not be kind. Manage the Madness To effectively navigate the monastery, you must be mindful of the characters' mental health. Each playable character possesses a fully realized set of traumas and phobias. Triggering these traits depletes a character’s sanity, ultimately triggering a traumatic event with negative effects such as paranoia, dementia, or bouts of violence; fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played. Discover the Secrets Within Choose from two different escape plans to execute, each with its own stories, objectives, special characters, and other surprises. Time is continuous in The Stone of Madness. Actions have consequences, and players must consider their time of day as they make decisions. Sneaking, exploring, and gathering materials are all ideal tasks to complete during the day when security guards are easily distracted. But as morning gives way to evening, the paranormal inhabitants of the Monastery will start to reveal themselves; posing a threat to the characters’ sanity. Nighttime is most wisely spent planning and managing the escape plan. Any player who explores the monastery after curfew will be met with an extra challenge. Security is tighter, and guards will not take kindly to any prisoners wandering about. But sometimes, the risk is worth the reward. Experience a Stunning Hand-Painted Art Style The visuals in The Stone of Madness have been lovingly hand-painted and animated frame by frame, drawing heavy inspiration from 18th-century artist Francisco De Goya. The game's isometric perspective acts as the perfect showcase for the eye-catching visuals, allowing players to observe every minute detail and feel as if they’re adventuring through a Goya painting brought to life","2025-04-08","/game/124067","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202408/1620/25aa518d26905baef197a3a59d5062321c8ba83fe358aa3c.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0114-PPSA23604_00-0536269101527624","34%","0","Strategy","692.34","null","null","The Stone of Madness","TRD","TRIPWIRE INTERACTIVE, LLC","2025-01-28","the-stone-of-madness-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","0","692.34","0","",

""No Tears for Heroes"" is a narrative exploration of war's psychological toll, told through the intimate thoughts of soldiers fighting in the winter of 1944. Unlike traditional war games, it criticizes the futility of armed conflict by focusing on soldiers' inner struggles, fears, and memories. Through poetic storytelling and quiz gameplay, players experience how war strips away humanity while forcing young men to confront mortality, fear, and the artificial nature of enemy lines. It's a meditation on how conflict reveals both the depths of human cruelty and the universal desire for home, peace, and understanding.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202411/2208/1eea0409428a70dabe8087e1099fc13e6e989601d4c41743.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/UP5877-PPSA27346_00-0643346650447275","30%","0","Educational","22.42","null","null","No Tears For Heroes","TRD","Playstige Interactive","2025-01-17","no-tears-for-heroes-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","34.50","0","24.15","0","",

"0","2025-04-23","Experience the universe of the Alien films like never before: in terrifyingly immersive single-player VR. An all-new action-horror entry into the classic franchise, Alien: Rogue Incursion transforms you into Zula Hendricks–the ex-Colonial Marine hellbent on exposing Weyland-Yutani’s blacksite experiments–on a dangerous mission to investigate an SOS from the backwater planet Purdan, home to a long-defunct mining colony. With her ever-present synth companion Davis 01 for guidance, Zula must infiltrate the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility and survive the ever-present threat of the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered, with both skilled stealth and serious firepower at her disposal. With deeply personal stakes propelling both Zula and Davis deeper, they must plunge to the dark heart of Purdan to expose–but not unleash–the horrors lurking within. Alien: Rogue Incursion’s authentic atmosphere and innovative VR gameplay features will have you feeling and fighting like a Colonial Marine, no training necessary. Get into the action with gameplay that uses your body as the input. Along with true-to-life motions like opening doors, peering around corners, and picking up items, you also have a full-body in-game physical presence for holstering and loading weapons, accessing inventory, turning on lights, and more. And you’ll need that confidence against Xenomorphs who behave just like their cinematic counterparts: actively hunting you throughout locations, stealthing through ducts and tunnels, and jumping on and climbing objects within the world.

Manage passenger flow with precision! With an advanced passenger system, each city has a realistic population, and the larger the city, the greater the demand for flights to various destinations. You can’t afford to connect every city directly, so you'll need to strategize, create efficient hubs, and prevent airport overloads. If any airport reaches capacity, it’s game over. The world is your playground! Explore nearly 180 territories and tens of thousands of cities. Build airports anywhere and start transporting passengers globally. Adapt your strategy to different regions: shorter routes are easier to manage in places like Europe, while long-distance connections in vast areas will require careful planning due to higher costs. Choose from multiple game modes: Discover the World, Free Play, and Challenges. In Discover the World mode, unlock and connect territories as you expand across the globe — but act fast, as you must unlock a new region every six minutes or you lose! In Challenges, take on unique scenarios with specific goals, such as surviving for a set period or earning a target amount of money. Each challenge offers something different: some require you to constantly unlock airports, while others might involve rebuilding your network after a coronavirus outbreak. Stay engaged with random events! Unexpected events — from investments to disasters that disrupt flights, to even humorous situations like a lawsuit over spilled coffee — keep the gameplay dynamic and unpredictable. Compete with other players! Face daily scenarios and climb the leaderboard in every challenge. Earn points for transporting passengers, generating revenue, and building infrastructure.

"","2025-04-23","Get ready to massacre monsters, race your rivals, and combat corpses of your fellow guards as you race to escape Black Iron Prison in the critically acclaimed roguelike, [REDACTED]. Black Iron, a state-of-the-art penitentiary located on Jupiter’s icy moon Callisto, is overrun with hordes of infected inmates. As a modest prison guard your job is simple – get to the last escape pod and get out alive! Fight through dozens of unique enemies and challenging environmental hazards as you battle your way out of the prison. But you aren’t the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals – a deranged custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more – can’t wait to step over your corpse and save themselves. Only one of you can make it off the moon – make sure it’s you! FIGHT/DIE/ADAPT Each death is a learning experience. Starting fresh each run, build up your loadout with powerful experiments, weapon schematics, and buffs to battle through Black Iron. When you die (and you will die), use your hard-earned loot to purchase new permanent weapons, suits, and skills. Get stronger, experiment with your strategy, and get out! ROUT YOUR RIVALS You're not the only person to survive the initial outbreak or willing to use a bit of violence to get to the last escape pod. Some prisoners and even your correctional services colleagues are just as eager to escape and will make escaping harder by attacking you remotely or challenging you to a one-on-one duel. Race them, attack them back remotely, and fight them to the death to make it out in one piece. FIGHT YOUR LAST CORPSE When you die, you leave more than a coverall-clad carcass. Defeat the reanimated corpse of the last guard to succumb to the prison’s dangers to earn a powerful experiment. But beware, it’s not going to be an easy fight. The semi-alive guard has the same loadout they had when they met an untimely end and a few extra tricks up its sleeve to keep things spicy. DO OR DIE You’ve made the perfect build, battled through bosses, ran through rivals, killed your corpse, found all the files, and now you’re standing in front of that last escape pod. Sure, you could leave it all behind for the sweet taste of freedom… or risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the prison. Fail and you lose all your purchased gear, skills, suits, and weapons. But IF you succeed, you’ll unlock new powerful permanent gear. FUTURE PUNK An irreverent attitude, unique presentation, vivid graphic novel style, and a 180bpm original arcade-punk soundtrack by Mutato Muzika enhance [REDACTED]’s sci-fi setting and fast white-knuckle action.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202408/0304/03184e9f61ecf26dcd322f65376f4f79b29ca8d2242a6560.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1970-PPSA13647_00-00000BIRDPS5SIEE","30%","0","Action","612.5","null","null","[REDACTED]","TRD","KRAFTON, Inc.","2024-10-27","redacted-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","0","612.50","0","",

"","2025-04-23","About Mokoko X was inspired from the arcade games from 1980s and 1990s, a popular gaming style back in the time. Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the unlucky girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay The main goal is conquering the bigger portion of the screen. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield depletes. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and the required conquered area percentage for the victory. Key Features - 8 unlucky girls in need of help - 32 levels with unique bosses and minions - Absurd stories that will reveal details about the bosses and the girls - Fully animated, Japanese and English voice overs for all the characters! - Lovely graphics! - Traps, towers, crates and bonus effects - Arcade Mode - Live high scores displayed for hardcore players - Nostalgia remastered! Stories Have you ever asked these questions to yourself: How do you stop a heartless but not soulless emperor? Can someone be a gyroscope and a guard dog at the same time? Why do those ducks attack us? Are there really demonic headphones in the world? Why do lizardmen need a plastic toy for summoning their god? How do you become a villain after revolting against the ant queen? What do scientists want from Albert the wonderful sea creature?

The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE INFECTED Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202501/3116/28d7764d5b63480bbda55a6c368eeaebed3afb9bcff95d51.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2DIGITALEXTRAS","67%","0","Action, Horror, Adventure","577.17","null","null","Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Digital Extras Edition","TRD","TECHLAND SP.

"","2025-04-23","Road Defense: Outsiders is a game that combines elements of the 'roguelike' and 'tower defense' genres. Upgrade the towers and your own skills to be able to annihilate all the life around you! During the game, every time a driver reaches the end of the road, he pays a fee. Well, maybe this is not completely legal, but use the money received to buy new weapons for the towers or upgrade the ones already installed. This money received from the drivers is not going to solve all your problems, and if you depended on it alone, you would already be dead. For this reason, each enemy killed can release an orb that raises your experience bar. Every time this experience bar fills up, you level up and can temporarily improve your skills. In this way, the more enemies you kill during a wave, the more orbs you collect and the stronger you get. Not everything may go as planned and sooner or later you will end up being killed by these gangs. When this happens, don't despair, because the total number of enemies you have killed during the match is also converted into money! And it is at this point that you can improve your skills permanently, starting the next match stronger and with more advantages.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202408/1921/49d72097b6b4346eb582413f303f1565e82ca9d099d17515.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0546-CUSA49999_00-ROADDEFENSEPS4EU","20%","0","Shooter","140.0","null","null","Road Defense: Outsiders","TRD","QUBYTE","2024-09-12","road-defense-outsiders-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","175.00","0","140.00","1","",

"","2025-04-23","Dustborn is a single-player, story-driven action-adventure game about hope, love, friendships, robots…and the power of words. You play Pax: exile, con-artist, Anomal — with the ability to weaponize language. Looking for a new life and a way out, Pax has been hired to transport an important package from Pacifica to Nova Scotia, across the Justice-controlled American Republic. Sounds like a legit reason for a road-trip, right? So pack your bags, assemble a crew with their own peculiar powers, and get ready to travel the country! Explore the stunning Neo-Western landscapes of an alternate history America on a robot-driven tour bus, and stop at a dozen locations along the road to build your crew, manage relationships, complete missions, and face increasingly difficult challenges. But the people you stole the package from want it back, and the authoritarian Justice is hot on your heels, so don’t forget to pack your baseball bat! (And, oh yeah, you’re travelling undercover as a punk-rock band, so you’ll definitely need to brush up on your musical skills before your next gig.) At the end of the road lies salvation…but to get there, you’ll need to cross an entire continent. Visit WeAreDustborn.com to get the latest news about the game. THE POWER OF WORDS Words have power. Like, actual power. Fight with Shouts and use Vox in conversations to manipulate people and talk your way out of hairy situations. Craft new words, and learn to wield a lingual arsenal against enemies...and friends. A ROAD TRIP ACROSS A DIVIDED CONTINENT. On the road across an alternate history America, you’ll stop at iconic locations, take on unexpected assignments, meet a colorful cast of characters, enlist new crew members, and evade (or fight) your pursuers. See beautiful sights along the highway, rendered in a colorful graphic-novel-inspired art style that brings stunning 2D illustrations to 3D life. A DIVERSE CAST OF CHARACTERS Your crew is your (found) family. Round up, manage and lean on a motley mob of misfits with peculiar powers, compelling stories and clashing personalities. Branching dialogues lead to choices that shape relationships and change how your crew feels about themselves and others. GAMEPLAY AS VARIED AS THE LANDSCAPE In each location you’ll explore, investigate and chat with the people you meet, use the crew to overcome challenges, craft new Shouts and Vox, and rehearse with your band. You might also find yourself throwing Molotov cocktails from a motorbike, swing a baseball bat to take down helicopters…and more. You know, just normal everyday stuff.","2025-04-08","/game/79898","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202307/2814/0fbbff24e736b46d52b42d3cf76b61b8d97be5abab5f23aa.png?w=200","15","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1628-PPSA08051_00-DUSTBORN00000001","60%","0","Action, Adventure","367.15","null","null","DUSTBORN","TRD","QUANTIC DREAM SA","2024-08-20","dustborn-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","17","419.60","1","",

In the year 2049, the once-promising lunar research base, named ""AstroGenica Lunar Nexus,"" has become a haunting beacon in the desolate expanses of the Moon. Serving as humanity's gateway to the cosmos, it now stands as a chilling testament to an experiment gone wrong. As the protagonist, you awaken in the cold sterility of the medical bay, disoriented and alone. The eerie silence is broken only by the hum of malfunctioning machinery. An unsettling darkness envelops the lunar base, casting shadows that seem to writhe and pulse with malevolence. Exploring the abandoned corridors and chambers, you discover cryptic remnants of the crew's activities – hasty recordings, fragmented logs, and ominous experiments conducted in the name of advancing human knowledge. It becomes clear that the crew's scientific pursuits unleashed an ancient extraterrestrial force, one that feeds on fear and has twisted reality within the confines of AstroGenica Lunar Nexus. The nightmare deepens as you encounter grotesque manifestations of the crew's worst fears brought to life by the insidious lunar entity. Each step forward reveals more about the base's descent into madness, and the horrifying fate that befell those who once called it home. Armed with only a flickering flashlight and your wits, you must navigate the increasingly nightmarish lunar landscape, solving puzzles, avoiding otherworldly threats, and piecing together the fragments of a dark cosmic secret. The lunar base holds the key to your survival, but it also harbors the eldritch horrors spawned by humanity's reckless curiosity. As you inch closer to the heart of the lunar nightmare, the line between reality and delusion blurs, and the chilling truth awaits discovery. Will you unravel the mystery, or become another victim of the lunar entity's insatiable hunger for fear? The fate of AstroGenica Lunar Nexus rests in your hands, and the lunar nightmare may leave scars that transcend the boundaries of space and time.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202407/1418/454e3ac129e5e82b982f558ad5e92591ea3860606b1d757a.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8070-PPSA20935_00-0726458907238881","30%","0","Horror","90.35","null","null","Lunar Nightmare","TRD","Playstige Interactive","2024-08-15","lunar-nightmare-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","139.00","0","97.30","0","",

Together, they’re the Freelance Police—an irreverent comedy duo whose esoteric crime-fighting style has been entertaining comic book and video game fans for more than thirty five years. In 2006–2010, Sam & Max starred in a series of episodic adventures created by Telltale Games. Now you can play their first three seasons (Sixteen episodes altogether!) in these remastered versions, which have been lovingly updated with gorgeous HD graphics, overhauled lighting and lip-sync, finessed cinematography, remastered audio, and several all-new musical tracks featuring live jazz musicians. SAM & MAX SAVE THE WORLD It's just another day at the office when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam & Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the ""spinny thing"" they do with their eyes.) Who's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds. SAM & MAX: BEYOND TIME AND SPACE The Freelance Police are back on the crime beat in a showdown with Santa Claus, a race to subdue a giant volcano, and a face-off with a Eurotrash vampire… and then things get even weirder. Is paranoid shopkeeper Bosco on to something with his talk of a grand conspiracy? Is diner proprietress Stinky hiding the truth about what happened to her grandfather (also named Stinky)? Will flaky neighbor Sybil Pandemik ever find true love? Did someone say… BIRTHDAY?! Zombies will dance. Mariachis will sing. A giant battle robot will trash the streets. And when their friends’ lives are on the line, Sam & Max will risk their very souls to set things right. SAM & MAX: THE DEVIL’S PLAYHOUSE Max has always been the more unhinged member of the Freelance Police—a lovable lunatic with a knack for spreading chaos wherever he goes.

"","2025-04-23","Purchasing this digital product includes both PS4 and PS5 versions of the game. The Return of the (Vi)king More than a decade after Volgarr the Viking’s chaotic, challenging debut, the barbarian king’s story continues in an uncompromising new form. Volgarr the Viking II is a hardcore, 2D action-platformer where precision is everything and one false move can spell a brutal death. Players of the original game will feel right at home on this relentless voyage, even with the addition of new power-ups, new forms of magic, new enemy types, and a chest-thumping new soundtrack. While the sequel delivers the same unforgiving 1980s-arcade level of difficulty as the original, Volgarr the Viking II also (mercifully, begrudgingly) offers modern quality-of-life options such as checkpoints, save states, and an undead mode.

"","2025-04-23","Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. Airstrip DLC It is more story-driven than what we did in the past and it allows you to build a small airstrip close to your gas station. Meet Joe Joe is an old pilot flying an old single engine plane. He is a bit strange and one day approaches you to help him with his endeavours. For that he needs a place to land in the middle of nowhere to make a stop halfway to his destination. In return he is willing to cut you in on his deals. The Airstrip You have plenty of space and as it turned out, there used to be an old military landing strip during WWII close to your gas station. Should be that hard to make it work again, right? You might even go a step further, order some aviation fuel and some parts for planes. A windsock wouldn’t probably hurt and some lights might turn out to be useful, since you will on occasion also need to help him land. Let’s see how things develop and what Joe is up to... The Plane Joe’s plane is like its pilot: old. It’s also simple. The most advanced technology on this thing is the LED reading light Joe uses to find his way on the chart. How hard can it be to fix some simple things on a small plane? And it’s not like you are doing it for free. The Gameplay The Airstrip DLC brings new game mechanics and content to Gas Station Simulator based on events. Unlike the content we introduced in the past, it does not require your constant attention, it is more something that happens every now and then.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/0811/b8f13605c8c28858ee9edb0a090601b63229b7a90f139710.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-0529173475105583","30%","0","Simulation","545.35","null","null","Gas Station Simulator and Airstrip DLC Bundle","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2024-05-16","gas-station-simulator-and-airstrip-dlc-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","839.00","0","587.30","1","",

"","2025-04-23","Insurmountable is an adventure roguelike with permadeath, in which the player has to overcome huge mountains. Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don't get into the critical range. This task is made more difficult by a dynamic weather system, day/night changes and a multitude of randomly generated events, where you never know in advance how they will end. Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last. Choose one of three characters with different skills and background stories and start by climbing the first mountain. Search crates, caves and ancient ruins for equipment from past adventurers. You'll need it, because even the first mountain will demand everything from you. But don't worry. As time goes by, you'll become stronger and stronger. Take advantage of a sophisticated skill system to determine which strengths your climber should have. In the course of each of the three mysterious stories, you will meet dangerous animals, overcome deadly abysses, encounter sinister and well-meaning characters, who do not always have to be human. Here, too, each of your decisions decides the following events. Three mountains have to be conquered at the end. One higher and deadlier than the previous one. Divide your forces and your equipment correctly, because you don't have a second attempt and you can forget about learning a route. In Insurmountable you have to cope with unknown dangers, react spontaneously to unpredictable events and realize in the end that, as in life, you can't always know the consequences of your decisions, but you have to cope with them anyway and in the end, it often turns out differently than you thought. Face the challenge of ever new and changing dangers, face snowstorms and the sheer force of nature, always keep your eyes on the summit and overcome the insurmountable. Keyfeatures -no two climbs are alike -procedurally generated mountains -dynamic world with different weather effects -hundreds of events with ever-changing outcomes -strategic gameplay in path finding, stat and equipment management -3 characters with different abilities","2025-04-08","/game/91814","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202304/2513/1de9436b3c7b6a4ffedfa5ec11bb95a433a398ae44513825.png?w=200","6","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8923-PPSA15021_00-0358891004897229","35%","13","Simulation, Adventure","454.35","null","null","Insurmountable","TRD","Daedalic Entertainment GmbH","2024-04-24","insurmountable-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","9","454.35","1","",

"","2025-04-23","Dock, split, and form up! Pilot 3 fighters and take back the sun from the clutches of evil! Get the SOL CRESTA Complete Set at a great new price that offers the slick and speedy gameplay of the main game's Arcade Mode, the densely woven story of the Dramatic DLC, and the Legendary Fighters DLC that includes the legendary fighters from the CRESTA series. What you get in the SOL CRESTA Complete Set: - SOL CRESTA main game - SOL CRESTA Dramatic DLC - SOL CRESTA ""Legendary Fighters"" DLC Set (CR47, Wing Galiber, Wing Galiber II included) Note: The SOL CRESTA Complete Set consists of the SOL CRESTA main game and all DLC packs that are currently available to purchase, with no exclusive content. Be careful of duplicate purchases. PlatinumGames’ NEO-CLASSIC ARCADE series carries on the spirit and fun of classic gaming using modern technology, and the first project in this endeavor is SOL CRESTA. SOL CRESTA takes the docking and formation strategies of classic shooting games Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta and elevates them with the “free-form docking” system. The flagship Yamato, composed of the fighters Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susano can utilize various attacks depending on how the three ships are aligned. Docking, splitting, and reforming the ships as needed is the key to defeating the invading armies of Mega Zofer. Story Humanity faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Mandler Army during their last invasion of the solar system. Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune. With the last of their hope, they formed the solar recovery squad SOL CRESTA, and placed the fate of the solar system with the Yamato, a cutting-edge docking ship. - Free-Form Docking The Yamato, standing against the evil of Mega Zofer, is composed of 3 fighters. You’ll scramble with only one fighter at first, but pick up the right item and friendly fighters will appear for a power-up! Dock and split to change your attack properties and use different formations to access an amazing arsenal. - Classic 80s-Style Excitement SOL CRESTA’s music is provided by legendary chiptune composer Yuzo Koshiro, and the game pays homage to the sound and visuals of the earlier Cresta series games, bringing back that arcade fever while taking it beyond mere nostalgia. There’s even a time limit, high score Caravan Mode, and online leaderboards. - PlatinumGames' New Challenge What would happen if PlatinumGames, developers of satisfying and jam-packed action games like Bayonetta, NieR:Automata, and ASTRAL CHAIN tried their hand at shooting? This is the answer. The visuals are classic, but the originality and depth of the systems and gameplay provide a fresh and deep shooting experience that grows each time you play. Note: The SOL CRESTA Complete Set consists of the main game and all DLC packs. The Dramatic DLC adds the Dramatic Mode to the game, which presents a dramatic storyline featuring an array of unique characters. The ""Legendary Fighters"" DLC adds three additional playable fighters in the form of CR47, Wing Galiber and Wing Galiber II. See the store pages for each DLC for more details, being careful of duplicate purchases.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202403/1111/a36b914af0ecd972719a44b5e7874078dd49f603b76d3ca1.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2385-CUSA26895_00-SOLCRESTACOMPSET","50%","0","Shooter","395.0","null","null","SOL CRESTA Complete Set","TRD","PLATINUMGAMES INC.","2024-04-03","sol-cresta-complete-set-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","790.00","0","395.00","1","",

It's time to dive into the world of Solasta! Roll for initiative, take attacks of opportunity, manage player location and the verticality of the battle field. Set yourself up for the finishing strike and possibly roll a natural 20 at that key moment of a battle. In Solasta, you take control of four heroes, each with unique skills that complement one another. Every hero expresses themselves in the adventure, making each action and dialogue choice a dynamic part of the story. Players will create their heroes just as they would in a pen-and-paper game by choosing their race, class, personality, and rolling for their stats. You make the choices, dice decide your destiny. An Epic Team Adventure Discover the shattered world of Solasta. Explore ruins and dungeons for legendary treasures, learn the truth of an age-old cataclysm—and stop it from happening again. Create your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. Tailor your squad to your preferred strategy and maximize your party's abilities. The choice is yours. Online Multiplayer Co-op Play any campaign with up to 4 players for more fun and shenanigans! The best part? The host shares all their DLC with the other players! Time to fireball some friends. Discover a Mysterious & Dynamic World Delve into long-forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. Fight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over—on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground. Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. Size also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though—the monsters are also thinking vertically. Custom Campaigns In Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the official campaign is over.

"","2025-04-23","You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? A PSYCHEDELIC SCI-FI JOURNEY ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in both an eccentric art style from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami, and a mystical soundtrack composed and performed by Ratvader – Oscar Rydelius. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling. A WORLD OF CONTRAST Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths. A MYSTERIOUS, LAYERED LOOP The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree. Experiment with and master your own specific fighting style as you explore the world of ULTROS.

The unsettling news revolves around a chilling incident from several months ago: a maniacal psychopath brutally murdered two teenagers within the hotel's walls. In response, the management abruptly shut down the motel, citing ""renovations"" as a cover. During the supposed renovations, a wave of eerie occurrences unfolded. Construction workers reported encountering apparitions, and some even suffered severe mental distress, compelling them to abandon their work at the site. The enigma shrouding Crimson Motel piqued my curiosity; it's precisely the kind of mystery I thrive on. Armed with my investigative prowess, I am determined to gather concrete evidence within the hotel's haunting confines. Backed by my comprehensive computer setup in the van, I will meticulously process all the information I collect. My ultimate goal is to capture undeniable proof of these spectral entities on video camera. If I manage to record any ghostly apparitions, that would be my invaluable contribution to unraveling the secrets veiled within the Crimson Motel.","2025-04-08","/game/145294","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/2513/c5dc20197474a343e661b5a98c01bb8382a8b104b868563f.png?w=200","3","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8070-PPSA19909_00-0395415848382488","30%","0","Horror","44.85","null","null","Death Motel","TRD","Playstige Interactive","2024-01-18","death-motel-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","69.00","0","48.30","0","",

"","2025-04-23","In this single-player board game-inspired strategy game, solve puzzles and use dice and cards to successfully run your private security agency. Advise your agents as they deal with security, fugitive recovery, repossession cases, and more. Agents Hire freelance agents to help complete cases! Every case has different requirements and with a wide variety of agents to choose from, finding the right agent for the case is essential. Expand your roster to accommodate more agents by completing caseloads and receiving rewards. Cases Whether it's security, repossession, fugitive recovery, or moonlighting, careful reading and planning are the keys to success. Ascertain the specific case requirements and bring your A-game to the table by sending the right agent to get the job done. Dice Each agent has 5 stats with different values, ranging from 0 to 5. The value corresponds to the number of dice allocated when performing a stat roll. Puzzles Some cases offer diverse and immersive gameplay with genre and era-specific puzzles (read: mini-games). They are a mixture of cryptograms, digital and analog mechanics: reflex-based as well as mathematical challenges. Gear Cards By using cards, stat values are temporarily increased for dice rolls. Gear Cards have a tier value which indicates the rarity of the card, as well as a durability factor, indicating the total amount of uses the card has before it is removed from the inventory. Mean Streets To root out the cancer gnawing at the city, use all the power and resources available to you: from your agents and era-accurate surveillance technology to friends in high places.

The great grandpappy of adventure games will test you and tickle your problem-solving skills as you unearth its plot and secrets. Through cunning trial-and-error you will crawl through tight squeezes, encounter impressive caverns, collect inventory, locate treasure, thwart dwarf attacks, all while keeping your eye on the score before your lamp goes out. Dust off your vintage Colossal Cave maps from the 70s, they'll still work like a charm. This is a faithful tribute to the original game design. Developed in the mid-1970’s by amateur cave spelunker, this classic text-adventure was originally crafted as a way for a father to entertain his two young daughters. Will Crowther based his design on detailed cave maps he’d made with his wife, Patricia, of the Bedquilt section of Kentucky’s Mammoth cave. Family cave exploration is at the heart of this game. Shortly thereafter, the code-prankster, Don Woods, discovered the game on the ARPANET and expanded the cave. He layered in more fun, fantasy, puzzles, and a vexing 350-point system. Years later, Don’s expansion became the most accessible and the definitive version of Colossal Cave Adventure. Enter Roberta Williams. She first played the game in 1979 and was instantly hooked. She spent weeks playing, taking notes and mapping out the cave, as it was revealed through the textual descriptions in game. Her mind filled with imaginary neon mushrooms, misty underground lakes, a snappy bivalve mollusk, and a noticeably absent giant. After achieving all 350 points, she was ready for another adventure – a dilemma in 1979. If it was another adventure she wanted, she’d have to make her own... In 1980 she designed and developed the world’s first graphic computer game, Mystery House. This groundbreaking game is considered one of the most influential in history, establishing conventions that have become standard in the adventure genre. It has been ported to just about every computer and console, played by millions, and inspired many other games, books, movies, and TV series. Relive the golden age of adventure gaming. Immerse yourself in a timeless, sprawling cave system filled with treasures, creatures, and brain-teasing puzzles. Transport back to a more innocent time.

"","2025-04-23","Venatrix is a unique hybrid of action-packed and stealth-based horror game. We choose to play as either Matthew Kolth, an occult obsessed paranormal investigator, into nightmarish scenes to fight perturbing monsters from ghastly realms, or as Della Hartfort, as she slithers her way stealthy to avoid the same monsters Matthew is emptying his bullets upon. Join either Mr. Kolth or Mrs.Hartfort as they both try to make sense of a hellish adventure that leads them into the depths of their own psyche and back again. Live through their difference of reality-gaze which merges fiction and ethereal dream sequences and go on to fight against evil in this dimension…and the next. Matthew Kolth is a paranormal investigator at the turn of the century that takes on a new case at Hartford Mansion. There he meets Della, the wife of a rich businessman that believes her house to be haunted. She sees visions of demons and beasts of other dimensions. As a player, we have two deliberate choices: We either pick Matthew or Della, and both alternatives offer completely different play styles and adventures. Matthew must journey through the dream-like yet horror filled halls of the Hartford mansion before heading to Carcosa Asylum in pursuit of Della and the answers she holds. You must guide him from the bone chilling depths of his own psyche and back into stability all the while fighting terrifying monsters and trying to solve mind bending puzzles to progress through the game. Matthew must fight with enemies from outer space, other dimensions, and from the depths of his own soul to avail victorious from this mysterious and blood curdling case. Matthew must overcome his inner demons in a story that twists and turns as you must follow your instincts to find evidence – whether this evidence tells more about the case or about Matthew himself, is to be found out. Alternatively, you can play as Della and befriend with shadows. She will embark on the same path Matthew has ventured, however she would only have her stealth-wise skills to confront or avoid those monsters. Inevitably, her version of this dangerous undertaking will also trigger her soul to face her own inner demons as well, but perhaps she has a different spectrum of opinions on the same worldly matters of which Matthew has a “male-gaze” upon, her own interpretation, as an audacious Victorian-lady... *Two different playstyles…Third-person action/horror and first-person stealth/horror *More than 20 types of enemies to encounter, or to avoid, depending on your playstyle *Two different story-lines *Enigmatic puzzles and vast variety of locations from Victorian mansions to mysterious fantasy landscapes *Ominous dynamic soundtrack. *4K Resolution and Ray-Tracing","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/2913/1bb775393341fe2872c932d7f7f1f7292269be34ed73f367.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8070-PPSA17930_00-0337079664242141","80%","0","Unique","78.75","null","null","VENATRIX","TRD","Playstige Interactive","2023-09-21","venatrix-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","105.00","0","",

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0318/6e4c1a9bea5d06b549bdd4e0ed67c3ab9837c643da774614.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2333-PPSA15802_00-KRZPS5SIEE000000","60%","0","Unique, Adventure","307.6","null","null","Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition","TRD","Annapurna Interactive","2023-08-17","kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","769.00","0","307.60","1","",

"","2025-04-23","Iron Danger is a tactical combat game with a unique time manipulation mechanic—a never before seen combination that blends the tactical depth of turn-based games with the exciting action of real-time games. Tackle challenging encounters with your party of two characters, using a variety of skills and highly interactive environments. Maybe you'll light an enemy on fire and kick them into a grain field for a proper barbeque, or set up a trap and fell a tree on top of them. The options are endless, and you're the one in charge! You have control over time The core of Iron Danger is its unique time control mechanic. You can rewind time up to 5 seconds whenever you want, trying different strategies and combinations of moves until you find the right one for the task at hand. The time manipulation allows us to combine real-time combat gameplay with controls from more traditional, tactical turn-based combat games. This gives tactical combat a puzzle-like element, as you can keep trying new approaches to turn impossible odds to your advantage and synchronize the actions of your characters for the perfect outcome. You will die, but you will not fail! Iron Danger is set in a world of lofty fells, primeval forest, and placid lakes...as well as living gods and monsters of steel. The city of Kalevala, home of the humans who rebelled against the gods and forsook their protection, shines in the middle of this world, surrounded by towns, sea lanes and woodlands under its protection. But from the frozen north, a witch queen is leading her army on a quest for vengeance against the lords of Kalevala. Ancient ruins from the days when gods dwelled on the earth are opening to unleash forgotten powers, tempting humans and striving to overtake the world.

"","2025-04-23","Play with friends co-operatively or form hostile factions In this open-world galactic sandbox, how you play is up to you! Bring your friends into the frontier in your own private server, or make new friends (and enemies) in large public multiplayer servers. Play peacefully in co-op, or use the dynamic multiplayer faction system to band together and split apart dynamically as allegiances change. Build ships from scratch and travel to new planets Your first planet is where you’ll learn to survive, but that’s just the start. Build your very own starship and use it to colonise new worlds. It won’t be easy, and only the most successful colonies will be able to pool the resources and knowledge necessary to break orbit. Once you launch, the stars hold brand-new planets, new biomes, bosses and challenges. Craft, research, loot and exploit your environment You’ll need to prepare to take on this hostile part of the galaxy. Get mining, farming, growing, developing, researching, and building hundreds of different items, from winter combat gear to advanced laboratories. Find something you can’t work out for yourself. Strap on your handcrafted laser rifle and venture out into the unknown to explore dungeons, procedural bases, NPC stores and much more. Defend what you’ve built, or take on the galaxy Defend your colony with fast-paced combat that utilizes physics like bullet drop, projectile speed and spread. Thwart enemy raids on your base with your stock of handcrafted grenades. Tired of just defending? Lay waste to enemy bases with destructible terrain as you wield everything from rusty old carbines to nuke launchers and energy weapons that harness the power of lightning! Develop and construct advanced bases for protection Grow from a tiny outpost into an advanced, nuclear-powered fortress. Manage resources carefully and choose research paths based on the items and challenges you encounter on each planet. Watch out, though: the bigger your colony gets, the more of a target it becomes for raiders (and jealous friends). Automate work and train up a team Even out here, you’re not alone. Save AI survivors and build a colony together. A range of unique stats, perks and flaws mean every colonist has something different to contribute. As your AI colonists complete tasks they’ll level up and get smarter, stronger and faster. Best of all, you can assign tasks and orders to NPCs to do the grunt work for you and prioritize their roles based on those skills. Want to take a break from mining to destroy an underground alien nest? Let your colonists handle that for you! And Remember Your ship may be in ruins, your ammunition running low, and your teammates scattered across the surface, but remember this: You’re more than just another adventurous spirit. You’re a Farworld Pioneer.","2025-04-08","/game/129509","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202307/2411/012099a6712612b2484a81e41a52f849b5443060a681acfa.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-PPSA13377_00-0134071212675868","60%","0","Adventure, Simulation, Action","183.75","null","null","Farworld Pioneers","TRD","tinyBuild LLC","2023-08-15","farworld-pioneers-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","28","210.00","1","",

The Prince rolled the katamari and made the katamari bigger and bigger, rolling up all the things on the earth. The katamari that he created floated in space, sparkling, and brought back the lost starry sky. As the starry sky was restored, the King's fans gradually grew in number all over the world. The King wanted to respond to the wishes of his fans for his success, and the Prince kept rolling the katamari to make everyone's dreams come true. • We Love Katamari Damacy has been powered up! We Love Katamari Damacy, the second title in the Katamari series released in 2005, has been remastered. The graphics have been completely redesigned, and the in-game UI has been revamped to make it even easier to play. • New additional features such as Royal Reverie are also available! In his youth, the King received a strict education from his father, the Great King. New challenges have been added where you can roll around as the King in his boyhood! The days of hard study and intense training can all be rolled through in 5 all-new challenges. Will the young King be able to clear the tough challenges? In addition, a selfie mode has been added, allowing the Prince and his cousins to take quick photos while rolling through the stages! • A simple but very deep game! Roll the katamari, roll up objects, and make the katamari bigger. You can roll up anything from paper clips and snacks in the house, to telephone poles and buildings in the town, to even living creatures such as people and animals.

"","2025-04-23","Built from the ground-up for Virtual Reality, Budget Cuts Ultimate is an action-adventure stealth game where you zip, sneak, and stab your way through enemy-filled offices, trains, warehouses, and skyscrapers to take down the evil efficiency robots at TransCorp. Bringing together the complete Budget Cuts 1 and Budget Cuts 2 games, this epic includes all previously released Budget Cuts content; weapons and enemy variety, arcade levels, game modes, and modifiers into one seamless adventure. In Budget Cuts Ultimate, your very important paper pushing job is being taken over by robots. TransCorp is an expert in the business of manufacturing cost-cutting robots, and now you are about to be “fired”. Is humanity being optimized out of existence altogether? Budget Cuts Ultimate is an action-adventure stealth game set in a dystopian office-scape with tons of evil robots and even more knives (for throwing and stabbing them with!) Use your TransLocator to teleport through the offices, trains, factories, rooftops, and other secret departments of TransCorp. Find weapons to throw at unsuspecting robots, or to take down a guard that has spotted the “intruder”, or avoid combat entirely by finding sneaky alternate routes and clever hiding spots. Solve puzzles with the help of tools and clues, and befriend sarcastic characters in this tongue-in-cheek adventure. How you approach each combat situation is entirely up to you, your imagination, and the number of knives you can hold in your hands","2025-04-08","/game/140821","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/1114/058f4a4126553401c634c3f301ecaee3986b7cd853ffee02.png?w=200","6","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5210-PPSA08266_00-1901385599201244","35%","0","Action, Action, Adventure","614.25","null","null","Budget Cuts Ultimate","TRD","NECO SOFTWARE","2023-05-31","budget-cuts-ultimate-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","945.00","0","614.25","0","",

It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and travelling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller.

Choose the shots, censor any “troublesome” content, and steer the narrative as your country tumbles into totalitarianism. No pressure, right? Hand-pick the Headlines Not For Broadcast drops you into the heart of a darkly-comedic tale of televised chaos, where your every decision helps shape the fate of a nation. From ego-fueled celebrities to deceptive politicians and enigmatic advertisers - you control the public’s perception. As long as you can hold the audience’s fickle attention, it’ll be your choice whether to toe the party line or hype up the scandal. Will you make that sportsman seem like a national treasure, or an alcoholic disgrace? What about those scientists trapped in Dante’s Taint? Or that new boss at multinational giant Rymmington-Svist who seems to live a double life? Most importantly, will you help the brand-new government look benevolent, or is there something untoward about them that the public need to see? The power is in your hands to change everything, but you’ll have to decide quickly - the news goes out live! Craft the Narrative (and the Nation's Fate) You are in the driving seat of a multi-level tale about both an entire country and a single family. Being the architect of the nation’s future is a challenge, to be sure, but so is trying to hold your household together through the dark times. With multiple branching narratives, every choice you make resonates into the future. Will you help your spouse’s sibling flee the country... even if it involves breaking the law? Who are ‘Disrupt’ - concerned citizens or something more revolutionary? And how do you feel about your son spending more and more time with them? And then there’s Grandma... Can you afford her life-saving treatment, or should you and your spouse be taking advantage of one of the Government’s brand-new Transition Centres? After all, granny, there’s nothing more noble than unburdening your children! And then there’s your broadcast room - when it’s not overheating, it seems to be trying to electrocute you. Keep the plates spinning as best you can, but remember, whether it’s a newsreader who just won’t take it any more, naked streakers at the Sportsboard Final, or the ever growing threat of nuclear war... this show MUST go on. Cue the Ads Select your ads carefully to mould the public’s opinion. Why not choose to show only adverts for the companies you have shares in? Maybe that extra cash will help with the difficult decisions at home. Or maybe you’ll be selling dangerous toys to the nation’s children…With more than 50 hilarious ads to choose from there’s never a dull moment - even during the breaks. Endure the Unthinkable and Laugh in the Face of Adversity There will be smiles, there will be tears, even as the world falls apart around your ears. So grit your teeth, close your eyes and keep those cameras rolling - the people are counting on you. Long live the National Nightly News.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0614/4bae72a32b61a34c6f3ee140dbb6c1a517668e8b79c861c8.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-CUSA30757_00-0742719842801524","75%","0","Simulation","175.0","null","null","Not For Broadcast","TRD","tinyBuild LLC","2023-03-23","not-for-broadcast-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","875.00","0","218.75","1","",

He progresses on his journey, raiding trading convoys, upgrading the ships and, of course, always keeping an eye on the morale of the crew. While doing so, he tries to persuade fellow pirate captains to join his fleet, all with with their own ships and individual abilities. With even bigger prizes in his sights, he will not stop until he is undisputedly the greatest pirate of the Caribbean. BECOME THE PIRATE OF ALL PIRATES • You are not born a great pirate, but we give you the tools to make you THE great pirate. Customize your own Flag under which your fleet will sail. As you gain experience, your notoriety and skills will improve. Roleplay with more than 35 distinct pirate’s skills on your way to claim your pirate throne.

ENGAGE IN TACTICAL NAVAL BATTLES • A ship is safe in a harbor, but that’s not what ships are made for. Fight in tactical turn-based naval battles on a hexagonal grid of epic proportions. Use your wits when raiding a convoy or a settlement. Victory is determined by a clever combination of your ship’s distinct armament with the varying and rough conditions of the sea.

Combining distinct upgrades of your ship’s basic gear, such as weaponry, hull, mast, or figurehead allows for more than 360 unique loadouts. MEET YOUR CREW’S NEEDS • As an elected captain of the ship, it is your responsibility to split the spoils and riches with your crew. Agreeing on so-called ‘articles of capture’ clearly define the objectives you embark on before leaving port. Remember the whispers of mutiny below the decks can lead to nasty outcome. After all, you are an elected captain and not placed by the grace of the Lord. PARLEY WITH INFAMOUS PIRATE LEGENDS • On your journey to become the most fearsome, most glorious pirate captain, you will have the opportunity to get to know several historic pirates. Choose your foes and companions wisely… COMMAND HISTORICAL SHIPS • Featuring 18 unique types of ships such as Ship of the Line, Frigate, War Galleon and many more.

"","2025-04-23","Your squad has crash-landed behind enemy lines in the heart of an alternate history Eastern Europe. With no intel or leadership to support them, these soldiers must fight their way back home before the horrors of war break them. Teamwork and strategy are paramount... Each soldier has their own personality and ideas on what needs to happen next. Some want to investigate what caused the crash that left them in hostile territory, while others want to lay low and wait for rescue. There are even whispers of desertion. You are the “unseen hand” that guides this ragtag group of soldiers to safety and possible rescue. Whether it’s as simple a choice as to which way to go next, or something as serious as how to engage their mysterious foes, every decision you make is serious and significant. Story-Driven Gameplay As your soldiers battle the mental strain of war, you’ll need to command them in combat— will they avoid the enemy, or go head to head with their foes? Unique Turn-Based System Combat is similar to that of a turn-based tactical RPG. Plan your turn in pause mode and watch your soldiers move when action phase starts. However, when new enemies and hazards appear, the game pauses to allow you to plan your reaction to this new change. Will you continue to charge forward or back off and seek cover? Choices Matter Choices you make will shape the story to your liking leading to different campaign endings. Choose wisely as your progression through the game will affect not only soldiers you command but also a whole region and everyone who happens to live here. But you should also keep in mind that your soldiers have their own opinions on what is good for the squad so you have to maintain balance between what you want them to do and what is good for keeping the squad in high spirits.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/3007/rjoeDGW2fbfZ2WXzfLgOugjs.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5733-PPSA05008_00-9319449668698946","80%","0","Strategy","69.9","null","null","Broken Lines","TRD","Blowfish Studios Pty Ltd","2022-12-13","broken-lines-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","139.80","1","",

"","2025-04-23","Play out a Kaiju movie as the mayor of Floatio city, tasked with holding off the overwhelming strength of a Kaiju attack with (hopelessly) outclassed military. Defend your city as five unique and devastating Kaiju grow in power with every attack. Unfortunately, they can't be killed, but can be slowed down and forced to fall back... for now. Monsters move towards the nearest building, and the scientists have mathed the exact odds of where they might go next. Build sacrificial army bases and airfields to distract the Kaiju. If standard methods aren't enough, deploy experimental weapons such as freeze rays and transforming mechas to keep them at bay. Or you can always park tanks and jets in the monsters’ path to slow them down (don't worry, we have a good insurance policy). If all your efforts fail, don't be ashamed and run away! Be prepared to evacuate the laboratory using transport trucks, boats, or planes when the Kaiju get too close. Play missions from all over the world as you progress through the fight against Kaiju in a 15+ hour story-based campaign. Throughout the campaign, you’ll have the chance to gain an advantage with upgradeable ACE units and Project Deck customization. Test your wits in tactical puzzles, command dozens of units in large-scale scenarios, and fend off repeated attacks in defense missions while developing your city economically. And if you’re hungry for more, test your command skills in weekly challenges! Features: Protect your city in a tactical battle with cannon-fodder tanks, jets, and more... unusual firepower. Face five different Kaiju - each with unique skills and potential for mutation. Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Do everything to stop the monsters, including sacrificing your units and buildings. Remember that you can’t kill Kaiju - you can only slow them down. Defend cities around the world in 15+ hours of campaign mode. Prove your command capabilities in weekly challenges.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202210/2807/qKQTy99C8tVFIPvaZKYkrQyV.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA33612_00-0734877255523884","65%","0","Strategy, Strategy","230.7","null","null","Kaiju Wars Deluxe Edition OST Combo","TRD","Klabater","2022-11-10","kaiju-wars-deluxe-edition-ost-combo-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","769.00","0","269.15","1","",

Colorful pixel art aesthetics: each tree, bush or rock is hand-drawn, each enemy has dozens of carefully crafted animation frames to create a one-of-a-kind visual experience; Mind-bending science fiction story: Several multidimensional versions of Earth were suddenly merged together, shattering one another in a cataclysmic event known as the Great Shift.

"","2025-04-23","Sam is a six-foot canine detective with a love of justice. Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they're the Freelance Police. And they're about to save the world. It's just another day at the office when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the ""spinny thing"" they do with their eyes.) Who's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds. ABOUT THIS REMASTER In 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within. Now everyone's favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell. Return to the adventure game that was once called ""gaming's first sitcom"" and is today known as ""the remaster you didn't know you were waiting for."" With enhanced graphics, five new musical tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN's Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that you'll love to play—or play again.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1517/6cR3MxF0nOi0WQxWQO4wa6FO.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5966-CUSA30837_00-8594065719104065","50%","0","Adventure","349.5","null","null","Sam & Max Save the World","TRD","SKUNKAPE GAMES","2022-09-28","sam-max-save-the-world-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","349.50","1","",

What Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of strange tales about a family in Washington state. As Edith, you’ll explore the colossal Finch house, searching for stories as she explores her family history and tries to figure out why she's the last one in her family left alive.

RIMWORLD IS A STORY GENERATOR It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and travelling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. BUILD. DEFEND. EXPLORE The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. The challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. ENDLESS COLONIST INTERACTION Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side. So your colony will always be a motley crew.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202206/0114/nn77e9mMsmevQfHbOU0Jdv1Z.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4415-CUSA31489_00-RIMWORLDDELUXE02","25%","0","Simulation","1443.75","null","null","RimWorld Console Edition - Digital Deluxe","TRD","Double Eleven Limited","2022-07-25","rimworld-console-edition-digital-deluxe-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1925.00","0","1443.75","1","",

When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.

Return to the world of Shadowrun, with this cult-classic turn-based tactical RPG finally ported to consoles.

With the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities. Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there!

The Shadowrun Trilogy comprises 3 cult tactical RPG games taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which magic has re-awakened, bringing back to life creatures of high fantasy. Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades. Shadowrun Returns The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Nearly 10 years ago, creator Jordan Weisman returned to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return… Shadowrun Hong Kong - Extended Edition HONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world’s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. As an ex-con living in Seattle, you try to make an honest living but when your foster begs you to meet him in China, things turn grim and you find out the police are trying to arrest you. And by arrest, they mean to kill you on sight! Build your team of Shadowrunners, mercenaries with big personalities who can fight using mystical or technical powers, and turn the tables on the elite corporate and the police.

Recruit a company of up to three mortal heroes and guide them in spirit on a desperate journey from Albion to Jerusalem. Explore a richly-imagined medieval setting on the brink of apocalypse. Trade with merchants, improve your heroes and unearth ancient relics. Search for the lost fragments of your soul, scattered across the multiverse - and save as many worlds as you can. KEY FEATURES: A Roguelike Experience Carve a path across the lands of Albion, Marca Hispanica and Al-Andalus. Will you take a dangerous route, risking life and limb in pursuit of a legendary relic? Or will you choose a safer path? Plan and prepare. Negotiate, barter, fight. Tackle challenges. Suffer losses. Recruit new Heroes. Earn Gold, Supplies and Renown. Be careful: your choices are permanent, as is death. But don't tarry - evil never rests. Tactical Turn-Based Combat Master the tactics of squad-based and turn-based combat to conquer both human and demonic foes. Your enemies will be tough and ruthless; make use of high ground and cover, set up ambushes and coordinated attacks, harness synergies between different Hero classes and skills. Non-Linear Narrative Enjoy a compelling story inspired by Arthurian legend, the Matter of France, and the history of Al-Andalus - with an unusual twist. Make choices in interactive encounters that change every time you play. Written by Jonas Kyratzes (The Talos Principle, Serious Sam 4) and Verena Kyratzes (The Lands of Dream, Serious Sam 4). Hard Mode Suited for only the bravest adventurers. Experience an even greater challenge with complex resource management and tougher enemies. Earn Essence with each run that can be exchanged for Blessings and Curses, adding temporary benefits and burden in equal measure to your next run. Dynamic Leveling Use Renown to level up your Heroes, and choose between a randomized set of new skills or improved attributes. But choose wisely! Select skills with great synergy and balance your party for the road ahead. Equipment Upgrades Seek out towns to improve your arms and armor, or stumble upon hermit artisans in the wild. With every day that passes, the world plunges deeper into darkness, and you will need all the equipment gold can buy. Relics From a peasant's humble luck charm to the legendary sword wielded by Arthur himself, items imbued with magical power are scattered about the world. Some you will be able to purchase from merchants and collectors, but others will have to be earned through acts of heroism - or displays of wit. Spells Rain thunder and brimstone upon your foes! Seek out and gather Soulstones to restore your power and unlock new Spells. Even if defeated, your spirit will retain all of your collected arcane knowledge as you jump into the next dimension. Alternate Dimensions As you jump from one parallel dimension to the next, history is reshaped. Different kings rule the land, changing the encounters, characters, and events. No two worlds are ever quite the same, and each journey will be unique. And should your heroes fall, remember: defeat is not the end, only a new beginning. There are as many worlds as there are stars in the sky. In each stands Camelot; in each there is a Grail. But there is only one Merlin, and his eternal burden is to stand against the horror from beyond. Each world that is saved is saved forever; each world that is lost is lost for good.","2025-04-08","/game/92277","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0131-PPSA04468_00-THEHANDMERLINPS5","75%","0","Role-Playing","209.8","null","null","The Hand of Merlin","TRD","tinyBuild LLC","2022-06-14","the-hand-of-merlin-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","22","262.25","1","",

"","2025-04-23","Neo-Classic shooting strikes back! Dock, split, and form up! Pilot 3 fighters and take back the sun from the clutches of evil in this free-form shooting game with the spirit of 80s shooting classics Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta. PlatinumGames’ NEO-CLASSIC ARCADE series carries on the spirit and fun of classic gaming using modern technology, and the first project in this endeavor is SOL CRESTA. SOL CRESTA takes the docking and formation strategies of classic shooting games Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta and elevates them with the “free-form docking” system. The flagship Yamato, composed of the fighters Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susano can utilize various attacks depending on how the three ships are aligned. Docking, splitting, and reforming the ships as needed is the key to defeating the invading armies of Mega Zofer. Story Humanity faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Mandler Army during their last invasion of the solar system. Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune. With the last of their hope, they formed the solar recovery squad SOL CRESTA, and placed the fate of the solar system with the Yamato, a cutting-edge docking ship. -Free-Form Docking The Yamato, standing against the evil of Mega Zofer, is composed of 3 fighters. You’ll scramble with only one fighter at first, but pick up the right item and friendly fighters will appear for a power-up! Dock and split to change your attack properties and use different formations to access an amazing arsenal. -Classic 80s-Style Excitement SOL CRESTA’s music is provided by legendary chiptune composer Yuzo Koshiro, and the game pays homage to the sound and visuals of the earlier Cresta series games, bringing back that arcade fever while taking it beyond mere nostalgia. There’s even a time limit, high score Caravan Mode, and online leaderboards. -PlatinumGames' New Challenge What would happen if PlatinumGames, developers of satisfying and jam-packed action games like Bayonetta, NieR:Automata, and ASTRAL CHAIN tried their hand at shooting? This is the answer. The visuals are classic, but the originality and depth of the systems and gameplay provide a fresh and deep shooting experience that grows each time you play.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202201/2607/dnlQ8xBV74eHY6V60C3J35ZF.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2385-CUSA26895_00-PGNCA01SOLCRESTA","50%","0","Shooter","384.5","null","null","SOL CRESTA","TRD","PLATINUMGAMES INC.","2022-02-21","sol-cresta-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","769.00","0","384.50","1","",

Sin Slayers: Enhanced Edition is an expanded version of Sin Slayers that includes all of the previously released expansions that include new locations, enemies, heroes, items, new storyline and many additional quests. Create, equip and lead a team of heroes. Each unit will have its own abilities and weaknesses, so plan your combat strategy accordingly. You’ll journey through stinking primeval forests, boneyards riddled with crypts and the graves of fallen warriors, and other places even the bravest adventurer would fear to tread. Battles, traps, and bizarre enemies... Everything and everyone wishes to take your life, but don't succumb to despair. Between fights your party can take their rest at a fountain, or while on the road in an old church which leaves its doors open to the weary and wounded. Travel every path and byway of the Valley, obtain new weapons on the field of battle or by fulfilling quests, gather ingredients for magical elixirs and resources to craft armor and amulets. If a certain item is beyond your crafting ability, ask the blacksmith in the Old Church for help. The best gear will allow you to challenge the deadliest monsters. The souls of many heroes were cursed upon death, leaving them to wander a dark and uncharted world, an afterlife reserved for sinners. Is this the end, or..? Gather your team. Equip them with weapons, armor, and amulets. Level up your abilities as you move forward. The Sin Lords must be slain. Sin Slayers features a classic turn-based combat system in the tradition of the best JRPGs, giving you free rein to pit your tactical skills against the wretched inhabitants of the Valley of Fallen Sinners. Steel yourself. Enemies are everywhere and you will need to make difficult decisions and face dire peril to prevail. Depending on your choices, the sinfulness of your team will go up or down. If it's high — expect tougher enemies. Whatever might be buried there, is it wise to desecrate those graves? Every decision you make matters, and on the road to the next Sin Lord you will have many opportunities to choose poorly. Every crusade against a Sin Lord will be unique as every location is randomly generated. Think you know everything there is to know about a fetid swamp? We promise there are new lessons to learn, though they may not be to your liking! Legends tell of a place betwixt worlds, a region outside time and space called the Valley of Fallen Sinners. A dense, preternatural fog lays like stinking breath over black woods. What cursed hordes await? Vicious beasts, damned warriors, the undead, and worse chthonian horrors, all with an unslakable craving for new souls to perpetuate their own unnatural life. This region is for the most contemptible cowards, those who died because of their sins and the darkness weighing down their souls. At one time, they lived as brave heroes across a multitude of worlds, and bards composed ballads to their noble deeds. Until the day darkness flooded their hearts and killed them. Now regret consumes them, but their souls will find no rest. They are doomed to wander the Valley endlessly, searching for rest, respite, an end to their torture. But they will know no peace until someone destroys the seven seals of the Portal of the Worlds. Only then will the gates open and the damned finally escape their prison... Truth be told, no one has attempted this before.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/2410/05qiDsHGdwFR9NYctpc0t1mP.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6216-CUSA25429_00-7873955240527144","45%","0","Role Playing Games, Strategy, Role Playing Games","349.5","null","null","Sin Slayers","TRD","Artem Korovkin","2021-09-02","sin-slayers-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","384.45","1","",

The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2520-CUSA23292_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","90%","0","Role-Playing","62.9","null","null","Disjunction - Digital Deluxe Edition","TRD","Fireshine Games","2021-01-27","disjunction-digital-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","629.00","0","62.90","1","",

As an unpaid intern in the dystopian city of Neo-Cascadia, you’ll wield office junk as weaponry as you make your way through the offbeat procedural dungeons beneath your company campus. [The Future is Wack] Failed businesses no longer just cease to exist--they sink beneath the earth, and their employees are cursed to wander the halls for eternity as monsters. It’s your duty to put these monsters out of their misery and repossess their assets--so that your boss can afford a new car, or something. [Not All Heroes Get Paychecks] Battle through the remains of failed startups themed off of gig workers, dating sites, and cryptocurrency. Uncover the true motives of your employer, a carbonated drink startup known as Fizzle, and their parent company, a subscription box manufacturer with an army of helpful shipping drones. Make friends with your co-workers! Hire a freelance goblin! Date a slime! Invest in crypto! Set a rideshare on fire! [Fight Flexibly] In the dungeons of Going Under, almost everything can be used as a weapon, from laptops to brooms to body pillows. Proper weapons can be found as well, but even they can break at a moment’s notice if you aren’t careful. Playing cautiously and picking the right weapon for the situation are musts if you intend on surviving your internship. [Horrible Bosses] And you thought your boss was a monster. At the bottom of the dungeons lurk the founders of the cursed startups, getting rich off of investments while their employees fight amongst themselves. Defeat them and return to the surface with their enchanted relics to empower the company you work for. [Get Paid in Experience] As you explore, you’ll encounter powerful Skills that change the way you play. Learn them at the Cafe and they’ll show up in future runs. Use a Skill often enough, and you’ll get it “endorsed” and available to start your expeditions with. Combine multiple Skills for crazy synergies, and you’ll be cleaning house in no time. [A World of Characters] Complete Tasks for your co-workers to gain Clout with them and unlock their unique bonuses. Learn more about Neo-Cascadia, the origins of Fizzle, and how the drone shipping empire known as Cubicle came to dominate the city. Can you save your company and yourself from going under for good?","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/1114/7dQYlqwdXzOaWtHhDlsh6uwV.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4064-CUSA19050_00-GOINGUNDER000000","75%","0","Action","174.75","null","null","Going Under","TRD","Team 17 Digital LTD","2020-09-23","going-under-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","174.75","1","",

On her first day at Dudsdale Elementary, 10-year old Jess accidentally gets everybody's favorite collectible card game banned, forcing the kids to take their card battles underground. Troubles arise when mutants from the game invade the real world, and it's up to Jess and friends to stop them. From the award-winning indie game studio, Gambrinous, creators of Guild of Dungeoneering, comes an RPG where battles are played with an epic collectible card game. Cardpocalypse takes you back to the 1990's, a time when computers used floppy disks, and people read magazines for video game cheat codes. You will explore Dudsdale Elementary on a mission to build killer card decks in an effort to defeat the mutants. You will have to trade, earn, wager, change rules and permanently alter cards on your way to victory. • BE A CHAMPION: Build your decks around the ultra rare Champion cards you earn.

"","2025-04-23","PLAY FROSTPUNK: CONSOLE EDITION This version of the award-winning game from 11 bit studios is tailored to give console players the full Frostpunk experience: • Thanks to the special, dedicated controller scheme all important features of the game are quickly within your reach. • The Console Edition of the game already includes all the updates that have been released since its premiere on PC. THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.","2025-04-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000","80%","0","Strategy, Strategy, Simulation","0.0","null","null","Frostpunk: Console Edition","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2019-10-10","frostpunk-console-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","209.80","1","",

In order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through the use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.

"","2025-04-23","Welcome to ChromaTec’s test lab! You’re here to test our newest, state-of-the-art military-grade color-technology: The ChromaGun (patent pending)! Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.

"","2025-04-23","Drive!Drive!Drive! is a racing game unlike any other, where players must drive their cars to victory across multiple tracks at the same time. Let us explain how this brain-melting idea works: You are able to switch between the different tracks of a race any time you like. When you switch away from a track, a computer racer takes over driving on that track for you. Unfortunately, the AI racers aren’t very competent. In other words, to place well in every track you're racing on, you’re going to have to hop track-to-track on a regular basis to account for the subversively cretinous computer cars.
