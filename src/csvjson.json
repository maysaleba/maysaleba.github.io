On top of that, you\u2019ll have to utilise the wackiest kinds of blocks (magnets, rockets and even nuclear fusion are no strangers for a well-trained astronaut like yourself), and work in exotic and not-quite-monkey-friendly places.

Guide the Moorhuhn through the jungle in his first jump and run platformer for Nintendo Switch™! The Quest for the WHATSIT An amulet lost 1000 years ago, the WHATSIT, has always been the Holy Grail of treasure hunters. Well, actually the Holy Grail is the treasure hunters' Holy Grail, but the WHATSIT comes right after it. And even Moorhuhn, the greatest adventurer among treasure hunters, cannot resist a hint as to the whereabouts of this relic. And so, he unceremoniously drops himself above the dense jungle and plunges headlong into the adventure. In the depths of the dense jungle, the Moorhuhn follows the legend of an ancient, lost temple complex. Legendary treasures are said to lie hidden there, but above all a priceless treasure: the sacred amulet of WHATSIT! Hidden traps, bad-tempered gorillas, aggressive crocodiles, strange shamans, forest spirits, temple guards, bats, warriors of the dead and stranded aliens require all the courage and skill of a real treasure hunter. As you would expect from a proper jump and run platformer, you need to use all your physical strength, courage, and skill.

Foxes are known as a mythical spirit in Japan as the tricking humans by turning into a human being. □Story When the stars and the moon appeared in the sky\u2015\u2015. You went to visit the concert hall where the lower note echoes rhythmically with vibration. Tonight, the one playing music is the Visual-Kei band \u201cFOX EAR\u201d. All 5 unique members are wearing a fox ear. Once you hear their voices, the magatama (comma-shaped beads) that you have on your neck beams out the light. This dazzling light made me lose my consciousness and taken back to \u201cFOX EAR\u201d \u2019s dressing room. As they pressure you to give them the magatama, but as magatama seems out the light again as if to protect you\u2026\u2026。 Although the 5 members noticed that they can\u2019t take it by force, they tried to make you fall for them to get magatama\u2015\u2015. □Characters Ak!to(暁仁) / CV : Mamoru Miyano (宮野真守) KASUM!
