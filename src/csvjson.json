AN EPIC ADVENTURE STORY Mark and his brother Don are flung into a futuristic era ruled by highly advanced technologies both revered and reviled. The inhabitants of this African apocalyptic world will help or hinder you as you make new discoveries and navigate the spectacular landscape. Negotiate your passage with local leaders, healers and warriors, or find yourself embroiled in a battle against nanite swarms, enormous scorpions and rocket-equipped robots. From thriving villages to crumbling cities, petrified forests and bone-dry ocean beds, this strange new world holds a multitude of terrains to uncover, beautifully rendered in 2D isometric art. Explore, solve puzzles and be prepared to face many tough choices that will shape this land long after you complete your journey. UNFORGETTABLE FACES Humanity as you know it has been totally reforged, and that is most evident by the characters in BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION. Technology and mortality have become blurred. Sentient religious robots run rife. Trans-humanistic tribes and leaders have emerged to claim power, and ruthless hunter mercenaries roam the plains. All have adapted to this powerful unknown, and are often at odds with each other. Meet and interact with over forty unique characters, each fully voiced by African voice actors, with thousands of lines of dialogue and multiple conversation paths.

When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park. It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece. · LOCAL CO-OP · 39 Days to Mars is a two player co-operative game.

The more the neurons are charged, the healthier the brain becomes. The healthier the brain becomes, the more of a fully-fledged life the person will live. It may seem simple, but it won't be as simple as it seems. To choose the direction of movement, the power of thought should be at rest, so it is important for you to correctly use the obstacles presented on every level.

At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout. It's a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. When the game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life. Playable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede.

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"1.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8Vlv9L9VM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"3","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.80","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"32.40","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"7.60","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"19.99","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-16","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-25","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

This 2D pixel arcade game lets you run left and right as much as your little heart pleases, but that's not all! It has other, more important features as well. - Collect chickens and produce energy using a special, non-violent method to upgrade the city and unlock abilities. The city gives you NPC assistants and squad members, and abilities let Vladimir take down opponents in increasingly showy ways, like summoning a pink worm to slow your enemies then using a giant wrench to deal a devastating blow. - Each stage you complete earns you VladCoins, which you can spend to upgrade Vladimir's skills and abilities, making him stronger. - Gigantic chickens with crates will grant you new abilities - the faster you catch up\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DrawChilly_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/draw-chilly-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"0","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"33%","Completionist":"0","genre":"Arcade,Action","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"1.80","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DrawChilly.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"19.60","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"DRAW CHILLY","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"HYPETRAIN DIGITAL","ReleaseDate":"2019-11-12","Slug":"draw-chilly-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"4","ChilePrice":"","Price":"2.99","MexicoPrice":"9.80","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.50","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-10","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-22","description":"Life went on as usual in the Inkland\u2026 until the Tower fell straight from the sky!

The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles. Leveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area. Players are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far. The type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animus-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"4.5","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"65%","Completionist":"0","genre":"Action,Role-Playing,Arcade,Fighting","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"4.54","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"45.50","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"ANIMUS","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"TROOOZE","ReleaseDate":"2019-01-03","Slug":"animus-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"13.29","ChilePrice":"","Price":"7.99","MexicoPrice":"52.15","MainExtra":"5","SalePrice":"2.79"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.84","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-12","LowestPrice":"2.79","SaleStarted":"2022-04-21","description":"These are the days before Ire: Blood Memory, the days when Kerr the Breaker\u2019s evil slipped its way into Cadmeia.

Inspired by long travel and the stream of consciousness it fosters, Glitchhikers asks you to look inward. Find the answers to your questions and question the answers you receive. Ruminate on life, the universe, our place and purpose in it.
