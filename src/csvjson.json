Experience the yet-untold story of Jason and Eve after defeating Earth's mutant scourge as they venture into the depths of space in their new battle tank, \"GAIA-SOPHIA\"! The story of Blaster Master Zero 2 begins a few months after the events of the first game (released on March 9, 2017), where the main protagonist Jason saves planet Earth from the mutants. Eve has been infected by mutant cells that are slowly corrupting her body, so together with Jason and Fred, they board G-SOPHIA and begin an intergalactic journey to Eve's home planet, Sophia, in hopes of finding a cure for the mutant infection. A perfect blend of action-adventure through outer space and the signature Blaster Master gameplay creates a formula for a fun new experience. ●G-SOPHIA's Gaea System is the key to maximum mutant blasting efficiency! The Gaea System converts the energy created by the impact of falling from tall heights or taking damage, then turns that energy into SP. By making good use of the terrain, more and more SP can be recovered, allowing Jason to use more of G-SOPHIA's sub-weapons. Mastering the Gaia System brings out G-SOPHIA's full potential, allowing players to traverse stages in an ultra-satisfying way. ●Get familiar with Jason's new technique, the BLAST COUNTER.

Everything in the world of Geodia is tied together by Sparklite... it's the life force of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned how to channel it safely. The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed providing a low-level, rechargeable power source. Or, for those brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of power with grave consequences.

Rife with dark humor, sarcastic quips, and the absurdity of the system. Seemingly built overnight, The Wall has divided both a country in two and a man from his family. To see them again, our ginger-haired protagonist has decided to become a contestant on \u201cThe Wall Show\u201d, a Regime-organized TV show allowing competitors the opportunity to escape to freedom on the other side. However, as he progresses through the camp, our contestant soon realizes exactly how the Regime and the show operate. The promise of freedom is not exactly what it seems. FEATURES * Cinematic platformer: Run, jump, crash, and climb your way through each Arena as the narrative unfolds around you. Much of the story is unveiled via smoothly integrated animation sequences, within the environment, or from NPCs muttering bits of dialogue as you dive and dodge around them. * Environmental HUD: Rather than having a screen cluttered with overlaid indicators, HP bars, and minimaps, any information the player will need is incorporated into the environment. Hints and clues are meshed into the game\u2019s art, subtle and specific, players will need a keen eye if they want to survive each Arena without breaking their legs. * Puzzle-solving: Use your wits, and at times a dash of ruthlessness, to advance through the Arenas. You\u2019ll have to interact with the environment itself to solve most of the puzzles: use the protagonist\u2019s momentum to move platforms, flip the occasional lever, and\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_MinistryOfBroadcast_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ministry-of-broadcast-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_cM3lKUK9Q","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"67%","genre":"Platformer,Adventure,Action,Puzzle","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_MinistryOfBroadcast.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"80","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/109633/ministry-of-broadcast-switch","RussiaPrice":"380","Title":"Ministry of Broadcast","ESRBRating":"Mature","Publisher":"Hitcents","ReleaseDate":"2020-04-30","Slug":"ministry-of-broadcast-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"20","ChilePrice":"","Price":"14.99","MexicoPrice":"99.99","SalePrice":"4.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.99","SCORE":"64","SaleEnds":"2022-03-17","LowestPrice":"3.19","SaleStarted":"2022-02-24","description":"Join a young t-rex Borti on his quest to find the best replacement for his tiny hands and arms.

Well, actually the Holy Grail is the treasure hunters' Holy Grail, but the WHATSIT comes right after it. And even Moorhuhn, the greatest adventurer among treasure hunters, cannot resist a hint as to the whereabouts of this relic.

Legendary treasures are said to lie hidden there, but above all a priceless treasure: the sacred amulet of WHATSIT! Hidden traps, bad-tempered gorillas, aggressive crocodiles, strange shamans, forest spirits, temple guards, bats, warriors of the dead and stranded aliens require all the courage and skill of a real treasure hunter.

The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles. Leveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area. Players are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far. The type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animus-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"63%","genre":"Action,Role-Playing,Arcade,Fighting","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"4.80","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"48.10","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"221","Title":"ANIMUS","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"TROOOZE","ReleaseDate":"2019-01-03","Slug":"animus-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"14.05","ChilePrice":"","Price":"7.99","MexicoPrice":"55.13","SalePrice":"2.95"},{"CanadaPrice":"4.06","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-03-03","LowestPrice":"2.95","SaleStarted":"2022-02-10","description":"These are the days before Ire: Blood Memory, the days when Kerr the Breaker\u2019s evil slipped its way into Cadmeia.

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality. In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.
