Take your time, explore and soak up every word. Two extraordinary strangers Frank and Drake are two extraordinary strangers brought together by unknown forces in a conspiracy that threatens them both. Sharing the same apartment, though destined never to meet, they must work together to uncover the mystery shrouding both their existences. Frank is the super of a run-down apartment block in Oriole City, worried he is losing his mind and what little remains of his connection to the world around him. Drake is allergic to sunlight and operates by night. Both experience visions and have unanswered questions about their pasts. Could the answers they seek be in these mysterious experiences? Their split existence means they must communicate via sticky notes left around the apartment. Despite this separation they must forge a relationship, uncover the mystery and survive. One compelling conspiracy Play both characters alternately: Frank during the day, Drake at night. What choices they make will affect what the other can do in the future. Though they must work separately, their fates are intertwined and depend on the trust and friendship they forge together. The game is set in Oriole City, a richly detailed and beautifully illustrated setting, full of mystery, remarkable characters, and secrets to unearth. Frank and Drake must explore these surroundings, solve puzzles and discover clues that will help them find the answers they desperately seek, to their respective troubled pasts. What choices will you make? The mystery unfolds via a branching narrative, where the choices you make will have a profound impact on the events Frank and Drake experience.

Alongside this, 6 classic cabinets have been enhanced for VR including favorites such as UFO Assault, Smoke \u2018Em and more. From Rags to Arcade Riches Convert a derelict family-run laundromat in the rundown town of Grindstone into a thriving arcade business. Manually pick up gum, clean the toilet, do the laundry, throw out the trash and manage profits to use your hard-earned coin to flip the family laundromat business into an Arcade Paradise. Genre-Bending Gameplay Featuring a wide range of gameplay, from the fully gamified laundry chores to each of the 39 cabinets you can purchase in-game, Arcade Paradise is a fully immersive simulation game. Test out your basketball skills by throwing out the trash, before taking a shot on the \u2018Basketball Blast\u2019 cabinet. Each cabinet features its own gameplay, stories, missions and high scores to set with competition online leaderboards - from full RPG campaigns, beat \u2018em ups, and physical sports games, all inspired by 3 decades of gaming. Coming of Age Storytelling A love letter to the 1990\u2019s, Arcade Paradise lets you step into the role of Ashley, a rebel teenager going against your berating father\u2019s wishes to continue in his footsteps in running the family-run laundromat business. Whilst your father, Gerald (voiced by Doug Cockle), is away in the Riviera, you take this as an opportunity to prove yourself by transforming his laundromat into the ultimate arcade. A Boundary Breaking Soundtrack From the individual games to choosing what song to put on the jukebox inspired by some of the great records of the early 90s, with 11 new tracks exclusive to VR, the soundtrack captures the heart of a bygone era.","SaleStarted":"2025-01-14","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202406/1013/bfd1f6950be97b523de147ded0e36c04601ef5a6081d5dde.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4382-PPSA20309_00-ARCADEPARADISEVR","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Unique, Simulation, Arcade","id":"EP4382-PPSA20309_00-ARCADEPARADISEVR","PlusPrice":384.45,"Popularity":"","Title":"Arcade Paradise VR","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"WIRED PRODUCTIONS LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2024-08-08","Slug":"arcade-paradise-vr-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"384.45","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-01-29","LowestPrice":"","description":"Space Surveyor is an arcade-style UFO surveying and landing game.

As long as you find a way to steal them. Know that a thief\u2019s trade is not a piece of cake. In order to get some practice, you\u2019ll start with petty theft. This is how you\u2019ll gain the experience required to access more and more risky \u2013 and most importantly, more profitable \u2013 jobs. Gain levels and unlock new possibilities. Get useful tools. Together with newly acquired skills, they will pave the way to expensive items, which you can then sell on the black market. The tools of your trade include a crowbar and binoculars, as well as advanced equipment that becomes available as you progress, such as a laptop for hacking through security systems. The creators of Thief Simulator 2 have prepared two unique locations with houses, banks, restaurants, and other special places that you\u2019ll get to strip of money, valuables, and other items. But before you do, examine the surroundings: find out when the building empties out, learn the tenants\u2019 or the employees\u2019 schedule. Then you just need to prepare a strategy and it\u2019s gone time. Just be quick and efficient. You don\u2019t have much time, so you\u2019ll need to immediately assess which item to take and which one to leave. Can you handle the pressure, or will you panic? Make sure to work on cars between robbing buildings. Start with small family sedans and make gradual steps towards mastery, which will allow you to steal the coolest sports cars. Remember to keep your eyes around your head. Even the best plan can fall apart, and the local police are just waiting for a chance to put you in handcuffs. Don\u2019t get caught. Always be one step ahead of law enforcement. Feature list: -Two neighbourhoods, with over 20 houses to break into. Learn tenant's routines, pick the right time to break in, and then rob them -Three heists, each with a unique location. Make your way into a resort with 6 houses full of loot, a warehouse crawling with guards, and a central bank with gold waiting to be snatched from the vault. -Get better and better tools, ranging from a crowbar or binoculars to hacking laptops, stethoscopes, etc. -Make your way into houses undetected, or run in welding a baton and knock everyone out. Alternatively, put them to sleep using sleeping gas or a tranquilizer gun. The choice is up to you. -Payphone missions - rob certain locations in a specified amount of time -Over 15 contracts requiring you to steal unique items -Level up your thief and acquire new skills, which allow a number of new possibilities. Learn special skills, and activate unique abilities. -Escape the police - intense chases with police cars and helicopters.

My six-year-old Daughter is a massive gamer just like I was at her age but most of the more suitable popular titles were just too difficult for her. So we teamed up to create a simple yet fun Battle royal game that can be enjoyed by all ages. The Fitzgerald's family is a fun loving bunch. Drop into the land where you will find a cool array of weapons to knock out your opponents with. From small snowball guns to epic ice blasters or electric zappers, rocket launchers, slime bomb guns, and paintball guns there are so many fun ways to play be sure to grab a cake or two and splatter your opponents right in the face. Pick up and eat beans to land smelly pumps. For quick getaways get your hands on a jetpack to fly away if you're finding yourself in trouble. The battle is played out on the Fitzgerald land and there can be only one king or queen of the land. There are handy level shops around the land to buy your favourite weapons by simply collecting as many coins and diamonds from the wide range of chests scattered around the land and if you are lucky enough to pick up some x-ray glasses you can seek out your opponents much easier. The safe zone will shrink in fast making matches quick and fun. Oh by the way watch out for Bruce the zombie and the ghost of posh aunt's mansion they think they own the Fitzgerald's land too.

It is impossible not to note the severity of this word because this action is associated with pain, loss, the need to choose difficult routes, and sometimes taking risks so as not to make new mistakes and not to fall off the set path. But is it worth enduring the pain? What happens if we simply go with the flow? How will our lives turn out then? The French philosopher Albert Camus asked similar questions in his famous essay \"The Myth of Sisyphus. In brief, the ancient Greek myth is as follows: the gods condemned Sisyphus, because he was too arrogant and too dodgy, to roll a huge stone up the mountain, which kept falling and had to start all over again. It would seem that what could be worse than this useless work? What was Sisyphus thinking as he climbed to the top of the mountain? And what do we care about him? Maybe we should admit that our lives are a bit like this Sisyphus? Approach Albert Camus's thoughts and feelings, his philosophy. Perhaps you will find some answers to these difficult questions. \u2022 Explore the world around you and find philosophical notes. \u2022 Take the stone to the top, higher and higher, and if it falls, well, start over, that's your punishment. \u2022 Choose your path correctly. Your decisions will determine the end of the game. \u2022 Discover the philosophy of Albert Camus. Don't try to understand every word, just let it pass through you. \u2022 Enjoy the abstract game world, and find different ways of passing. \u2022 And also listen to atmospheric music and sound effects.","SaleStarted":"2025-01-14","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/1720/2ec7923b93669974f8483c69eb15b79f726c80c93b2ed5f8.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2029-CUSA44262_00-0936199158514762","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP2029-CUSA44262_00-0936199158514762","PlusPrice":52.35,"Popularity":"","Title":"Heavy Burden","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Whale Rock Games OOO","ReleaseDate":"2024-01-23","Slug":"heavy-burden-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"349.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"69.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-01-29","LowestPrice":"/game/93973","description":"Marissa Marcel would have been a star.

Construct buildings to strengthen your village, train your army and equip your allies. Look for key-assistance in other villages, such as dwarves, amazons, and witches. With their help and the strengthening of your army, lead missions, defeat the invaders and make the region a safe place again. We are stronger together! Unlike regular Tower Defense games, Warstone TD has a unique method of summoning defenders (towers represented by player\u2019s allies and army). You start a mission with a fairly empty map and a few stones where you can place defenders. As the level progresses, more stones appear and some even drop from enemies, allowing you to place them in any valid position on the map. Powerful warstones also occasionally appear, which give significant bonuses to specific defenders when placed on them. You can summon any of the basic army classes on the stones. Each class has its own specialization path, damage type, gold cost, and special abilities. With such a variety of defenders and game classes there is a huge amount of tactics , increasing replayability even further! This is Warstone TD Gold Edition, a rare jewel of the game that will take you through the complete experience, including the Astral Voyage expansion with new battles and challenging enemies in even harder modes.

Reluctantly, Riley Poverly returns to her hometown to investigate the mystery, but what she finds is more than she bargained for. OXENFREE II: Lost Signals is the mind-bending follow-up to the critically-acclaimed narrative adventure game OXENFREE from Night School Studio. Play it as a standalone story or dive deeper by playing the original \u2013 it's up to you. As you play, you'll shape every step of the story through your choices. How you choose to deal with the supernatural events at hand will forever alter the future. Your choices matter. Shape everything through your conversations and dialogue choices. Forge a deep friendship with an old acquaintance from high school or opt to ignore a lost fisherman in need. Your choices impact who Riley becomes, your relationships, and the story options available to you at every turn. Start chatter from anywhere. Use an all-new walkie talkie conversation system to chat with contacts and uncover useful insights about the mysteries of Camena. Ask for info, check in with the locals, or completely ignore them. It's your call to make. And, it has consequences. Stop Parentage. Five years ago on nearby Edwards Island, a few teenagers unwittingly opened a portal, creating a rift between realities and timelines. Now, members of a mysterious cult-like group called Parentage are deliberately trying to open a new portal to pull something out. Who are they? What do they want? Are they trying to contact ghosts? Tune in to the radio. Ghostly signals are piercing through the frequencies of Camena. Tap into the eerie sounds and static using OXENFREE's signature radio mechanic. You\u2019ll communicate with the supernatural, manipulate the world, and travel to the past by tuning into time tears: unnatural fissures in the time-space continuum. Save everyone and everything. Your future was on the line in OXENFREE and those stakes are even higher in OXENFREE II. Explore, climb, and rappel across Camena\u2019s beautifully treacherous landscape. Take risks and see where it takes you. It might be dangerous. But it could also save the future. Not only for Riley but for everyone.

Additional characters can be purchased separately, so please be wary of purchasing the same character multiple times. A legendary arcade game developed by Dimps in 2005. This fighting game gained popularity for its smooth visuals powered by S.M.A as well as the high level of strategy driven by its 2-gauges system. And with the addition of new current-gen features it's even easier to play. - Battle Mechanics Polished to a Shine by a Legendary Studio Known for Fighters: The first original fighting game from Dimps, known for being involved in a number of other fighting games. It has continued to attract fighting game fans since its release in 2005 with mechanics that use 2 gauges--one for offense and one for defense--and slick 2D visuals powered by S.M.A. (Smooth Model Animation). - New Features for Console Provide a Modern Gameplay Experience: The console version contains new features such as an Online Versus Mode--a first for the series. It uses Rollback Netcode, which corrects lag between players, making for a streamlined experience online. And with 16:9 wide-screen support, AI and a training mode, you can fully enjoy this game in the comfort of your own home. - Main Game Modes: ・Arcade ・Survival ・Time Attack ・Local Multiplay ・Online Multiplay with rollback netcode ・Training ・Gallery Added features: Spectator mode, rematch, match recording, combat range and match time settings, assist mode, new character colors, button assignment for Boost Dive, and an updated training mode including character-specific gauge and enemy attack/dodge/ground recovery settings, as well as adjustments to enemy auto recovery timing. - The Story: It is the end of the 20th century... A large-scale natural disaster struck the eastern area of a nation. It wiped out the financial sector and resulted in a staggering loss of life. At the dawn of the 21st century, the conglomerate PROBE-NEXUS, commonly known as Probe, began reconstruction efforts in that eastern area. Colossal capital and cutting-edge technology was poured into rebuilding it. Skyscrapers that put the old high-rises to shame along with the world's biggest shopping mall and recreational facilities. This was the dazzling birth of a symbol for the new century. It was christened Zone Prime. And now, in an undeveloped sector of its western block, there was an area known as the slums... - Additional Characters: ・Greed A survivor of the illegal fighting organization \"Valor\". He joined the tournament \"F.F.S.\" again in order to fight against a yet-to-be-seen strong fighter. ・Hazama A new president of the PROBE-NEXUS, ostensibly to support the new chairman, Beatrice. But behind the scenes, he is working in the dark to extend his own power. ・Beatrice A granddaughter of Mr. Brad. And after his retirement, she succeeded him as Chairman of PROBE-NEXUS.

Micro Challenge brings an entire new take on the unique puzzle series by adding new player movement options and new terrain tiles. Whether you are a fan of the series or a first time player, this is the perfect place to start. Micro Challenge is a uniquely set up movement based puzzle game, and your goal is to examine each level and determine the most efficient route possible to collect all items before reaching the move limit. Like in previous entries your Player Tile can Move, Double Slide, Diagonal Slide, Tilt, and Teleport. Micro Challenge also adds the ability to change sizes. Shrink your tile down to fit through narrow hallways and corridors. Be careful when you are small as there are now towers filled with holes, and if you try to traverse them while in the shrunken state, you will fall to your demise! It costs 1 energy unit to shrink or to grow. This creates an entire new style of puzzle design in which you must determine when it's most beneficial to change sizes in your route planning. Micro Challenge features the ability for the Tile to become \"micro\" but it is ALSO a \"micro\" sized Tilting Tiles game. Micro Challenge is designed to be a perfect starting point for the franchise. It features 20 unique levels and 5 creative multiplayer maps! Not only does Micro Challenge feature a focused and unique single player puzzle set, it also contains a series first, with the all new Tilting Tiles Multiplayer Mode. Grab a friend and solve your way through Tilting Tiles Maps together. Both players share a move count, so you must examine the level together and determine who can collect which items more efficiently.

Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

The grass here is lush and green, and the sunsets are golden. Enjoy the idyllic countryside and relax to the sounds of the atmospheric soundtrack. On your farm, there\u2019s something to do every day. Give your plants and animals plenty of love and care! They\u2019ll reward you with a bountiful harvest.

With the action point locomotion system, no artificial movement is done! * Each action point is designed carefully to have everything you need within the reach of your hands. * Like: Everything you need to shear a sheep is right at the shearing station within your hand\u2019s reach. * Or: Everything you need to work on the fields is at the tool spot. All tools are in reach of your hands. * You can get to an action point with just a blink of an eye. No button learning: * Do everything with your own hands. No extensive button learning is needed. * To dig up a field, take a shovel with you and grab it with two hands.

Automatic Micro Games: * Instead of typical minigames that interrupt the game, Across the Valley automatically starts and stops a microgame when you perform an action. * An example: Sowing out seeds will automatically start a \u201cseeding\u201d micro-game when the first seed hits the field. The better you distribute the seeds, the more plants grow. Once the seed basket is empty, the microgame finishes and your plants start growing. Stay busy: * 36 tasks (quests) guide you from the basics of seeding to going on a truffle hunt with your pigs. * Infinite orders keep you busy, even after the main game. Cozy mood: * Carefully composed art style that lets you enter a comic-style world. * A well balanced mix of hand-drawn 4k textures and programmed effects create the illusion of a hand-drawn VR world. * Relaxing, exclusive soundtrack that puts you in the right mood. * Upgrade your house to make it look nice and cozy.

In doing so, you will maintain a fragile balance between both and benefit from the gratitude of both parties, - become the exemplary prison guard in campaign mode.

WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF DARKNESS What if vampires were real? What if these bloodthirsty predators lived hidden among us in complex societies and had been hatching conspiracies for thousands of years? And what if you became one of them? In Vampire: The Masquerade, you play as these alluring monsters in a sophisticated world where the lines between the real and supernatural are always blurred. A HEART-POUNDING THRILLER Hazel Iversen, the Swan, is the new Prince of the Boston Camarilla. An iron hand in a velvet glove, she intends to assert her power and respect the Masquerade, the vampiric law designed to ensure humans never learn of the existence of these creatures of the night. But nothing works as planned. With rumours of plots, murders and power struggles, you must work in the shadows to protect your Sect in a pulsating investigation that plunges Boston into chaos. PLAY AS 3 ORIGINAL VAMPIRES Play as 3 vampires who are over a hundred years old. Progress in the game through their intertwined destinies, deal with their different points of view and use their character sheets to try to separate the truth from the lies. Each character has their own vampiric abilities and disciplines that you can upgrade individually to suit your preferred approach. Will you choose intimidation, seduction or stealth? It's your decision, as long as you can sate your Hunger for blood. GAMEPLAY WITH CONSEQUENCES With its unique gameplay, Swansong puts emphasis on the consequences of your actions in both the investigation and your social interactions with other characters. Analyse each situation carefully because your decisions can have huge consequences on your heroes' lives and the fate of the Boston Camarilla.","SaleStarted":"2025-01-14","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202212/1909/GU3bzP9bkZFHI1tILcvaUsOS.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA07302_00-4424074468437360","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"85%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP6665-PPSA07302_00-4424074468437360","PlusPrice":374.85,"Popularity":"","Title":"Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong PRIMOGEN EDITION","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2022-05-19","Slug":"vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-primogen-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"2499.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"374.85","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-01-29","LowestPrice":"","description":"Horror Run is a Runner style arcade game where the user leaps and dashes through obstacles to get to the finish line.

The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won\u2019t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King\u2019s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter\u2019s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King\u2019s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose. \u2022 The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty.

When these horrors begin to bleed into the real world, Ai must accept that she has only three choices: hide, run, or die. ◆Evolving gameplay Test your courage in a dangerous game of hide and seek before initiating a terrifyingly twisted version of tag with abominations not of this world. Use the items you\u2019ve gathered to flee your sunset hell, but be sure to remember the paths you\u2019ve taken or risk being trapped there forever. ◆Japanese locations ablaze with a haunting, beautiful sunset Experience an unnerving mix of beauty, fear and nostalgia in a mysterious world where a Japanese house, school and hospital are all inexplicably connected. Explore corridors dyed twilight crimson, witness the ethereal glow of -amber through paper walls of a traditional Japanese house and escape creeping black shadows in hospital rooms where the power is somehow always out. ◆Hide or die 10-year-old Ai has no defensive measures to defeat the enemies you face; instead, you must take advantage of each spirit\u2019s weaknesses to survive. Hold your breath to sneak past blind foes or dash past deaf ones as quick as your little legs can carry you. And if you can\u2019t get away in time, prepare to suffer a dire fate at the hands of unimaginable forces. ◆A tragic tale of friendship, betrayal and facing your demons Mute and anxious, Ai is grateful when she makes a group of friends to play with. But it turns out that the ghostly apparitions trapped in the world of dusk aren't the only things she has to contend with; ghosts can be cruel, but children even more so. Your classmates harbour dark thoughts and harrowing secrets that you must uncover to progress. Throughout the game, Ai will learn more about her new friends than perhaps she'd care to know... ◆If only there were another way\u2026 Upon clearing the game, another ending will become available to you.

Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive? If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode! Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play. You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type. The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it.

Like the games that inspired it, Petal Crash features a variety of single player challenges in addition to an intense head-to-head versus mode. The rules are simple - push a block in any direction, and it'll keep going until it hits a wall or another block. If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage! Enter the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire. Eons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia. Each of them has their own wish, and their own story to tell. Challenge the Story Mode to take your chosen character through their tale, challenging all the others in fierce puzzle battles to assemble all seven Sacred Blossoms! Shoot for high scores in Solo Play, racing the clock or rationing limited moves to get the highest rank you can!

Barely. Take on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. If you can survive long enough to find it.","SaleStarted":"2025-01-14","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/2309/XEozUpmOCdLB940sqK9hCvS5.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3999-CUSA19091_00-NOWHEREPROPHETEU","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy","id":"EP3999-CUSA19091_00-NOWHEREPROPHETEU","PlusPrice":153.8,"Popularity":"","Title":"Nowhere Prophet","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NO MORE ROBOTS","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-30","Slug":"nowhere-prophet-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"769.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"153.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-01-29","LowestPrice":"","description":"\"Water Balloon Mania\" is an addictive puzzle game.

THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you\u2019re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you\u2019re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you\u2019ll discover choices in this world aren\u2019t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment \u2013 the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small \u2013 like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction \u2013 but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don\u2019t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society\u2019s population.
