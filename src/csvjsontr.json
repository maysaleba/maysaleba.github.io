In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane’s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","MainStory":16,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":35,"genre":"Action","id":"EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","PlusPrice":499.8,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/deathloop","Popularity":"1","Title":"DEATHLOOP","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Bethesda","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-13","Slug":"deathloop-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"2499.00","MainExtra":24,"SalePrice":"499.80","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"88","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"Being a mute, Otus struggles living up to the expectations of owl-hood.

You and your prime mates will be tasked with raising all sorts of quirky constructions on distant planets, by stacking blocks so they fit a given outline. To do so, you will have to team up with other space faring animals and master the use of your trusty apequipment - a banana-fuelled jetpack and a powerful robo-arm. On top of that, you’ll have to utilize the wackiest kinds of blocks (magnets, rockets and even nuclear fusion are no strangers for a well-trained astronaut like yourself), and work in exotic and not-quite-monkey-friendly places. Who said space construction was going to be easy? Monkey around with your friends! Moving heavy blocks is no small feat. Fortunately, up to 4 friends can join forces together to carry this burden (or drop it on each other's heads). Monkey around by yourself Waiting for friends to join you? Don’t worry! You can have fun in the single player campaign! Fancy blocks for every occasion To make the job more interesting, you’ll find some rather unusual blocks at your disposal. If you thought this would all be easy, wait until you have to try and catch a stray rocket block flying around, or handle an explosive nuclear fusion cube.

Welcome to Jeff Minter’s Akka Arrh. This modern take from the fine developers at Llamasoft combines the intrigue of an incredibly rare Atari arcade prototype with a unique creative vision that delivers a wave shooter that is insanely addictive. Akka Arrh drips with Minter’s sense of humor, love of psychedelic color, and ability to create games that are a joy to play. Key Features: Pure arcade bliss! You'll be thrown directly into the action where combos, high scores, and survival are your only goals. Create massive chains of enemy explosions and rack up ammo for precision shots to keep a combo and your rings (or life force) protected. Lose them all, and it’s game over. Start from the beginning of the 50 unique levels, or pick up where you left off to power through to the end. Accessibility! Sensitive to flashing lights or just not a fan?

Defeat waves of enemies using your ship to circle around them and create a punishing deadzone.

This Recharged release expands on the classic gameplay with a wider variety of deadly enemies and some new moves to even the odds. Accelerate to make some distance between you and a stalking Neutron and use your dodge to avoid the Quarks’ deadly laser attacks. With two modes of play, you can chase for high scores in both the endless arcade mode or 25 curated levels designed to push your reflexes to the limits. And, of course, it wouldn’t be a Recharged title without some new beats from Megan McDuffee. Hear the music build in real time as your combo multiplier grows higher and higher. Try not to get hit! Arcade Mode: Survive as long as you can against progressively dangerous enemies until you’re out of lives. Challenge Mode: 25 hand-crafted levels with unique challenges such as defeating a certain number of enemies within a period of time, each designed to make you think of new strategies to conquer them.

Defeat waves of enemies using your ship to circle around them and create a punishing deadzone. By removing the traditional ability to shoot enemies, this title challenges players to avoid taking damage and progress through increasingly difficult levels. This Recharged release expands on the classic gameplay with a wider variety of deadly enemies and some new moves to even the odds. Accelerate to make some distance between you and a stalking Neutron and use your dodge to avoid the Quarks’ deadly laser attacks. With two modes of play, you can chase for high scores in both the endless arcade mode or 25 curated levels designed to push your reflexes to the limits. And, of course, it wouldn’t be a Recharged title without some new beats from Megan McDuffee. Hear the music build in real time as your combo multiplier grows higher and higher. Try not to get hit! Arcade Mode: Survive as long as you can against progressively dangerous enemies until you’re out of lives. Challenge Mode: 25 hand-crafted levels with unique challenges such as defeating a certain number of enemies within a period of time, each designed to make you think of new strategies to conquer them. Power Ups: Unlimited dodges, freezing enemies, and the critical extra life will spawn to help you turn the tables on your enemies.

Near the end of Western Han rule, the powerful prime minister of China superseded his Emperor, promising an era of peace and prosperity. But ten years later, that promise has never been fulfilled. Instead, a decade of war and famine has left China in ruin, and its salvation seems to lie in the hands of a Mohist swordsman who gains control of a fabled artifact called the Elysium Scroll. Can the science-seeking Mohists revive their former glory, or will they fade into the pages of forgotten history?

Navigate by boat, discover islands, find new allies to help battle foes, and experience a humorous tale about friendship in this melancholic and atmospheric escape. Rich, Story-Driven Adventure Earth may be flooded, but it’s one heck of a view on the water. With a sense of humor, determination, and some great tunes, Nikos and friends will work together to explore the water-filled environment around them and embark on an adventure to evacuate to Mars and start a new life. 3D Exploration & Discovery Float along the vast waterways freely in your boat and explore the many different islands of a beautiful world where you’ll encounter danger, interact with fellow citizens, gather resources, and fight for a chance to escape to a new life. Turn-Based Combat With A Twist Take on your enemies in a classic turn-based combat system where careful tactics and puzzle solving will help you come out alive. Interact with the environment and items around you: knock down a tree, push a shopping cart into an enemy, or duck behind a turned over car to gain the advantage. Original Radio Tunes The world may be ending, but there's still time to enjoy some good tunes. As you cruise along the water, Highwater Pirate Radio is the key source not only of unique and original music, but also for commentary on your ticket to survival. Amid the Great Climate Catastrophe, the flooded region of Hightower has become a kind of safe zone between the two dry regions: the nearly global ravaged land of the War Zone, and the fortified city of Alphaville, where the ultra-rich live behind giant walls. With life on Earth becoming untenable for humans, and rumors of an escape to Mars floating around, Nikos begins a risky journey, picking up friends along the way. First to Hightower, then beyond to cross the impenetrable border of Alphaville, battling insurgents and stealing food along the way. Will Nikos and his friends manage to sneak onto the rocket in time?","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2818/2642f3f7a786aa51e18c79260ae3ca0d7648779bf1d7a05e.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6162-PPSA14282_00-0796569729505678","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":24,"genre":"Action, Adventure","id":"EP6162-PPSA14282_00-0796569729505678","PlusPrice":157.25,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/highwater","Popularity":"","Title":"Highwater","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Rogue Games, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2024-03-14","Slug":"highwater-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":7,"SalePrice":"188.70","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"70","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"/game/145793","description":"Control a Pong ball aching to break free of its life stuck between two paddles.

Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable.

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. The game centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a shockingly enjoyable sci-fi action running game where the player uses techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action bundle and with it re-invents the running game genre.

Penetrate the realm of the Hours, and win a place in their service. Perhaps - if you are very cunning - you may even glimpse the Mansus. - Outwit rivals, investigators and the increasingly suspicious Authorities. Your own altered Appetites may force you to act abominably, but your Cause must not be stopped. - Transcend death with a story-driven legacy system. Perhaps your inheritors will complete the Rite of the Crucible Soul. Perhaps they'll find peace in a pleasing career. Perhaps they'll bring the Dawn. CULTIST SIMULATOR: INITIATE EDITION includes the first three DLCs with new legacies, mechanics, characters and endings: The DANCER In the occult cabaret that calls itself the Ecdysis Club, the distinction between pleasure and pain is as delicate and essential as the human skin. It is all that keeps us from making the very worst mistakes. Pursue a career as a Dancer at the Club. Determine which parts of yourself to surrender. Cross oceans in pursuit of the ancient rites that beat in the Wood. Consider the ascensions that open to you. Choose carefully. The PRIEST A quiet suburban parish needs a new priest. Perhaps this might finally be the one who shows them the Way. Though their doctrines might be considered peculiar, their faith cannot be denied. Follow the path of Knock and serve your Disciples, both master and mastered. What is mortification of the flesh, set against those glorious visions of St Agnes? What the pain of this fleeting world against immortality as Martyr of the Keys? The GHOUL A disgraced medium. A gallery without windows. An elixir which permits the most final of feasts. A gnawing hunger which cannot be denied. All reflected in the snow-coloured eyes of Miss Naenia, gentlest of the Elegiast's Names. Dig in cemeteries. Desecrate tombs. Consume the dead to unearth their secrets or commemorate them. Comfort or betray the living. Eternize the lost Hours in the Palest of Paintings. Just be careful to feed your hunger before it grows beyond you.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202407/1813/d1db2d789b301e53868a2350d1b28d6761e7e6488c4e3a83.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/UP4713-PPSA24128_00-0519863325343393","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Simulation","id":"UP4713-PPSA24128_00-0519863325343393","PlusPrice":656.25,"Popularity":"","Title":"Cultist Simulator: Initiate Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Klabater","ReleaseDate":"2024-08-08","Slug":"cultist-simulator-initiate-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"875.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"700.00","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"HoneyLand, is a charming puzzle with a turn-based strategy.

You're the first operative to be recruited to the experimental Deadlink project. Pilot an autonomous combat shell, fighting your way through cramped slums, twisted labs, grimy warehouses, and sleek office buildings on a mission to thwart the schemes of the most powerful corporations in the world. Wield a deadly arsenal, upgrade your skills and tech, devastate destructible environments, and slash corporate profit margins — all at the same time. You are the Corporate Security Agency’s greatest weapon, and it's your job to make sure the corporations and their shady deals are anything but secure. With the team at HQ backing you up, you're tossed headfirst into the fray, where a military operation with plausible deniability can fix things for a fraction of the cost of a hopeless court case. Every randomized run will be different, but one thing never changes: you will be outnumbered. Get ready to think on your feet as you dash, jump, and use the environment to your advantage. You can't still, not even for a second. Equip your shell with powerful weapon loadouts. Try out various combinations as you blaze a path of destruction. Want to snipe your foes from a distance, debilitate them with status effects, or just go in guns blazing? Whatever your playstyle, you can find the right kit for the job. Your enemies have no shortage of bullets and bodies to throw at you. But you're no slouch either. Sure, you might lose a combat shell here and there, but your next one will be even tougher.

You are selling automated fabrication tools across the galaxy when your spacecraft crashes into a hostile planet where you'll have to build the strongest defenses if you wish to live to escape from it. But be warned... this planet is merciless. Use the tools you sell and the local resources to build up all of what you'll need to survive and eventually be able to escape the planet. Explore, fight, craft and build your defenses! Enjoy a unique and innovative game: - Strategy: survive massive attacks each night by building strong walls and placing turrets wisely. - Physics: build wisely or your structures will collapse! And you will need them to defend your base, or build bridges and high towers to access remote locations. - Water cycle: rain, infiltration, underground rivers and lakes... be careful during the heavy rains, or you could be surprised by a sudden water level rise! - Play classic or try the custom game modes: Under the Sea (start in a cave under a huge ocean!), Sky World (a random world composed of hundreds of flying islands), or Base Defense (no exploration, only base building and defense). - Activate the Hazardous Events option to trigger various surprises like Meteor Shower, Rain Flood, Earthquake, Volcano Eruption or even a Sharkstorm! - Enjoy Creative Mode and produce all items for free. This includes cheated items and tools to modify terrain or even create water and lava! Gameplay: - Fun from the start: no awfully slow digging, so you can concentrate on the exploration, fights and strategy. - Game's final objective: you must build a rocket ship to escape the planet. - Strategy survival: the game is a survival game in a strategic meaning. No hunger needs, the whole point of the game is to survive to the massive attacks each night. And to do that, you will have to explore the world to gather resources and craft your defenses. Fights: - No swords, magic or flying clown monsters here! It's a consistent science-fiction world, with fast and fun laser guns fights! - Intelligent monsters: they will find the best path to attack your defenses. And be careful: even if they can't move through walls, they can still destroy them! - Difficulty progression: only the species of monsters you have already killed before attack during the night (they probably took it badly). So you can progress at your own pace and choose when you are ready to move forward and fight stronger monsters. - AI companion: your crashed ship contains an AI that survived and will give you useful advices (or not!). Build him a drone so he can follow you and even help you fight the monsters! World Simulation: - Huge world with global real-time simulation of the environment, physics, water cycle and lighting. - Electricity: build solar panels or functional hydroelectric generators to power your base’s most advanced items! - Plants simulation: plants naturally grow and spread if their life-conditions are met. Create some farms with artificial sun lamps and irrigation. - Procedurally generated world: Major areas locations are specific to benefit from a logical game progression, but detailed layout of surface, caverns, ores, etc. are unique at each playthrough. Crafting and Building: - Crafting: You dig minerals, harvest plants and kill some monsters and bosses in order to craft better items and defenses. But the digging is really fast, your inventory space is infinite and all crafting recipes are displayed, so you don’t waste all your time on grinding or wikis and can concentrate on setting up better defenses. - Base construction: You build a fortress, not a holiday house.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2308/6e56d24f2550a77bee5a652a33655c45836d672e31c9d890.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0958-PPSA06478_00-DIGORDIEPS5EU000","MainStory":13,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":35,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP0958-PPSA06478_00-DIGORDIEPS5EU000","PlusPrice":244.3,"Popularity":"","Title":"Dig or Die","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BLITWORKS SL","ReleaseDate":"2024-06-05","Slug":"dig-or-die-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"349.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"244.30","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"Cross-save: Continue playing on the PlayStationÂ®5 exactly where you left off on the PlayStationÂ®4 at any time by simply importing the savegame from the PlayStationÂ®4 version!

Play solo or with up to four players in tons of sports & brawl games and fight to become king of the party. Customize your pool ball – choose your favorite color and design - and go head-to-head with your friends. Have a splashing good time! These pool balls are not just adorable, but also surprisingly athletic. They reach ridiculous speeds as they roll and bounce around the arena in no-time! Plus, these balls can kick each other around because they're balls after all! You'll be amazed by the sheer power of a perfectly aimed kick, propelling a rival ball all over the stage. Grab a cue and join the party! Features: • Chaotic physics-based sports & brawl games • Play with up to 4 players in local multiplayer or solo • Add bots to fill out teams or practice your skills • Easy to learn, hard to master. Anyone can join the fun! • Various game modes like Pool, Idol, Sumo and Free-for-all Game modes: • Pool: Score by kicking balls of your color into the open holes, but be careful not to fall in yourself! • Tennis: Either solo or in doubles, kick the ball across the court to score! • Sumo: No kicking allowed! Push the other players into the water by rolling into them. It’s push or be pushed! • Football: With one or two players on each team, shoot your ball in the opposing goal to score – or kick your opponents way to clear your path to the goal. • Idol: Compete to pick up and hold on to a small idol. Gain points by holding the idol – but beware: holding the idol means you can’t roll, while your opponents chase you down to knock the idol out of your hands. • Jinxed: One of the players is cursed! Kick, push or hit the other players to pass the curse onto them. When the timer runs out, the cursed player loses and the curse finds a new target. The last one standing wins! • Free-for-all: Knock your opponents into the holes and try to be the last one standing. • Tournament: Play a mix of all of different game modes and become the ultimate Pool Party champion!","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/2222/6951a9af799574a59913a4614345ad0a810e1f88818f27f6.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3945-PPSA19380_00-0072579820631109","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Family, Party, Sport","id":"EP3945-PPSA19380_00-0072579820631109","PlusPrice":349.5,"Popularity":"","Title":"Pool Party","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"MINDSCAPE BV","ReleaseDate":"2024-05-16","Slug":"pool-party-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"349.50","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"Gather people accross the city and beat your opponents with your excellent leadership.

Water post-apocalypse The ocean destroyed a once great civilization, but people survived and adapted. They built settlements on the roofs of tall buildings and the tops of other man-made structures. People travel across the ocean in tiny boats and huge combat vessels. The ocean provides everything they need, including extractable resources on the seabed. And yet, the dream of real land is still alive. True open world Explore the world at your own pace, discover new settlements and meet their inhabitants. Complete tasks, search for and extract valuable resources from the bottom of the ocean, earn money on trade or simply sell the artifacts you have obtained, and when you get the idea of how this world works, build your own base. Hundreds of unique ships Build boats from scratch or modify existing ones. Players have access to dozens of hulls and hundreds of parts, from which they can assemble anything ranging from a small boat to a hefty vessel 30 meters long, and then install equipment, armor and weapons. It’s important not to forget to gather a team of good crewmembers so that there is someone to stand behind machine guns and cannons or do other work on board. Fierce naval battles Pirates are always waiting for you at sea, and in some cases more aggressive players even start to chase you, so do not forget to install enough guns on your deck. You can destroy an enemy vessel, or you can capture it in battle and take it for yourself forever. Adventures might also get you into storming enemy fortresses and defending allied settlements! Personal naval base This shelter is reliably protected from enemies, and it allows a player to organize the production of everything that the captain may need on it. Build factories for the production of equipment, weapons, hulls for boats of all sizes, as well as the necessary resources. Flexible balance between PvE and PvP At first, you will only meet computer opponents, but later you can challenge other players if you are confident enough in your skills and gear. Always be on the lookout: if your task is to transport illegal goods, then other players may well take the quest to hunt smugglers. In Age of Water, everyone decides for themself who they are today - a peaceful traveler or a bloodthirsty pirate.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/2712/64a9e21da3c4db72405365f95b48edcdf4bcee5d25e206df.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4432-PPSA18593_00-0147816346325685","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action","id":"EP4432-PPSA18593_00-0147816346325685","PlusPrice":734.3,"Popularity":"","Title":"Age of Water","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Gaijin Distribution KFT","ReleaseDate":"2024-04-25","Slug":"age-of-water-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"734.30","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"Includes in-game currency (3000 Corks and 250 000 Medallions).

Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction. Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons. Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race. Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war. Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura. Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene! Every corner of the game’s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games. Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next. For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored.

Discover the Story Your path will lead you to the Worldwound, where the opening of a rift to the Abyss has unleashed all-consuming terror across the land. For over a century, the neighboring nations have fought fearlessly, trying to drive the enemy back — but to little avail. Now, you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel, backed by noble paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else entirely? Lead your army and challenge mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will leave you — and the world itself — forever changed. PLAY YOUR HERO, YOUR WAY Create any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset. Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle. FOR EVERY CHOICE, A CONSEQUENCE Your decisions have more weight than ever before. Your goal is clear, but you must forge your own path to it. Who will die, and who will live? Who will stay, and who will go? Make your choices, and watch the world around you change. A NEW WAY TO FIGHT Enjoy two combat modes as you slay your enemies – real-time with pause or turn-based. Switch between them on the fly, so you can always take things as slowly — or as quickly — as you like. The unique Pathfinder ruleset also allows you to perform advanced combat maneuvers, like mounted combat. Use them wisely!

And if you get on their bad side, well… Maybe it’s time to part ways. LEAD THE CRUSADE You will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of its demonic scourge. Take command of the crusaders and lead them to victory – both as a strategist, controlling the battle from above, and as a field commander, in a new tactical combat mode.

Reach impossible speeds in exciting futuristic races along an extensive championship campaign and the time attack mode to beat your own records. Extreme speed competitions through the dystopian wastelands where up becomes down and the horizontal plane becomes vertical. Each race is different because there are objectives to be met, from surviving a time trial, competing hard with more than 22 pilots simultaneously, or the original game of catching the runaway hare. Along the way we will find jumps with impossible flights and different types of obstacles and traps. But without losing the main focus that are the hypervelocity races that test the reflexes and driving to the limit. Take command among the 24 unique machine with their own characteristics and configurations. Plan well the turbo boost and help yourself to overtake the opponents and dominate the circuits. Or if you prefer to use the great novelty of the 'DESTRUCTOR WHIRLWIND', strategy to knock out your fastest and most dangerous rivals.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202403/0520/4992aaf4deb226e30a8530e62906de239ccb98d2f52bc01f.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8311-PPSA21521_00-0371740132371009","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Driving/Racing","id":"EP8311-PPSA21521_00-0371740132371009","PlusPrice":146.58,"Popularity":"","Title":"Hyper Turbo Boost","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"e-llusiontertainment","ReleaseDate":"2024-03-14","Slug":"hyper-turbo-boost-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"349.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"174.50","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"Juicy Realm is a roguelike game in which players must square off against bizarre fruits all across the world.

The award-winning darkly comedic game of televised chaos that critics have called a “Bizarre masterpiece” and “Quite possibly the best FMV game ever\"\" is now available in VR! Not For Broadcast VR takes the gameplay, story, and gripping dark comedy of the original award-winning FMV adventure and brings you closer to the news than ever. Get a full view of the entire newsroom, interact with your equipment and punch, slap and grab anything that dares to get between you and the truth. We promise it’s so immersive you’ll feel like you’re really being electrocuted by your poorly maintained equipment! Egotistical celebrities, dishonest politicians, and strange sponsors clash on the airwaves. You’re in the chair to ensure that the show goes on uninterrupted. Or at least, that’s what you’re getting paid for. There’s now nothing stopping you from spending all day hitting yourself on the head with VHS tapes, we suppose. Hand-pick the headlines… with your ACTUAL hands! Experience the lost art of inserting a VHS tape into a deck through the magic of virtual reality. Carefully position your “air-conditioning” so the news doesn’t overheat and turn spin wildly around your desk during the adverts (watch the cables, though). Plus, shake your fist in rage at whatever political ideology you don’t agree with (Or at everyone, it’s OK, they can’t see you). Frame the picture; frame the debate Keep the general public entertained with your editing skills, and keep an eye on those ratings. Make politicians look greedy or brave, make resistance leaders look noble or violent, and make news anchors look charming or unhinged. Who and what you decide to show on screen might change the course of history. No pressure. Keep it PG If VR was invented for anything, it was the simulation of pushing important-looking red buttons. Smash it (or gently tap it; it’ll work fine either way) to keep rude words (and other sensitive information) off the air. Keep the news safe for children and oppressive political regimes alike. Tune out the chaos, load up the ads, crank up the volume and immerse yourself in the dreams, fears, hopes and neurosis of an entire nation, all while sitting on your floor.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/2109/bb4ffdb077e6352c3af40a553e17db31b97e201c4617cb81.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-PPSA08716_00-9490505870769070","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adult, Simulation, Casual","id":"EP0096-PPSA08716_00-9490505870769070","PlusPrice":999999,"Popularity":"","Title":"Not For Broadcast: VR","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"tinyBuild LLC","ReleaseDate":"2023-12-14","Slug":"not-for-broadcast-vr-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"875.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"437.50","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"/game/86775","description":"You wake up in a spaceship with no memories.

You defend against the pathogenic microbes, attacking a single, infected organism. A key feature of Listeria Wars is the parallel viewing experience. In addition to the main game process, you can view the life of the human whose body has become the pathogenic battlefield. The action in Listeria Wars takes place within the hero's body. You can see everything that happens to the host’s body in real-time. You manage various types of immune system cells, to protect the body and fend off attacks, from deadly contagions. The body’s immune system develops antibodies, as the action takes place. The game illustrates a person’s ability to be his own worst enemy: by neglecting personal hygiene, or ingesting rotten food, or failing to follow “social distancing”. You can also view the body’s use of involuntary immune system responses, such as vomiting and diarrhea. The goal is to protect and defend the infected body, from the deadly pathogens. Key features: FUNNY ADVENTURES OF THE HERO: Watch the effects of malicious pathogens and influence the immune system’s response. CONVENIENT MANAGEMENT: Leukocytes attack intuitively, depending on the situation. Gamers can place these cells strategically and monitor the overall course of defense. PATHOGEN DIVERSITY: Realistic infections, microbes, viruses, bacteria, and other harmful pathogens. TACTICS: Manage unique leukocytes using their tactical advantages against the various pathogens, infecting the host.

Born into a new world where biological humanity is extinct but human culture lives on in a city of robots, you find yourself swept up in a mind-bending adventure involving a mysterious megastructure hiding enormous powers. The more you discover, the more you will be confronted with questions about the nature of the cosmos and the purpose of civilization. The broken promise of a better tomorrow, the fear of repeating humankind’s mistakes, faith in reason or renouncing humanity altogether - the choices you make and the sides you take will determine the course of events. A New Generation of Puzzles Solve a wide array of puzzles with varying difficulty levels, including clever metapuzzles and highly challenging Gold puzzles. Finish the game without solving every puzzle, or pursue the rewards of complete mastery. A variety of new abilities, such as gravity manipulation and mind transference, join the established mechanics of the original Talos Principle, creating a fresh but familiar experience. A Philosophical Odyssey Take the next step forward in the story of The Talos Principle in a thought-provoking, character-driven interactive story with multiple endings penned by returning writers Jonas Kyratzes (The Eternal Cylinder, Clash: Artifacts of Chaos) and Tom Jubert (The Swapper, Subnautica), joined by Verena Kyratzes (The Hand of Merlin, Serious Sam 4).

The story revolves around Rust and his sister, roaming empty lands and searching desperately for other humans alive. All other humans have supposedly fallen victim to the disease which causes those inflicted to suffer from insanity, sensory illusions, and uncontrollable self-destructive urges.

Within the game exists a whole new world full of people and monsters. A world in which wearing a game device allows players to utilize powerful memories and corresponding avatars to fight each other.

GAMEPLAY FEATURES COHESIVE “LIVED-IN” WORLD Scorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions.

Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement. The Tightest Crew The legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. They've been ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake. In order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan. Give In to Your Greed Give your greed an outlet and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash, jewelry, and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics, and accolades.

Gain experience, unlock new skills, and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges. The Art of the Heist A professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work, and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist; do you sneak or go in guns blazing? Do you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns? Do you go it alone or bring friends? The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays out. Thrive in Co-op Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends, whether you bring them along from your childhood or make them along the road.

If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"Contraptions\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style. Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels. Features + Solve over 200 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds. + Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it. + Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs. + Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like. Gameplay On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a “contraption” which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. When the level starts “time is frozen”, gravity doesn’t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again. Gadgets Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car. Objectives There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc. The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/1409/d420f69e4c70a643d3d47533dee33229f71a0db22c22613c.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4358-CUSA43722_00-CONTRAPTIONS3EUR","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Puzzle","id":"EP4358-CUSA43722_00-CONTRAPTIONS3EUR","PlusPrice":49,"Popularity":"","Title":"Contraptions 3","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FUNBOX MEDIA LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2023-07-20","Slug":"contraptions-3-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"245.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"61.25","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"The boys are back and ready for some arcade-style action in Otoko Cross: Pretty Boys Breakup!

There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work.

You will progress through main missions, you’ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises...

From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there’ll be a pesky agent who’ll want to work with you, and there’ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You’re a free man, after all. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies.

The bell tower that comes out of the lake is the last memento of the old village of Curon, flooded by the waters of Lake Reschen in 1950 due to the construction of a dam, despite the protest of the citizens. The plans for the dam started during the Fascist era, opposing the interests of a big industrial group to the wellbeing of the villagers, who were forced to leave their homes and pastures.

It’s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance. Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection! Dogs need a place to call home, and it’s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you’d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most! The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects. Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it’s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that’s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space. These dogs try their best, but sometimes they need a bit of extra help!","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/0814/u8g6usyPNiBjzh3KNk6Y5KWv.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7072-CUSA35705_00-WOBBLEDOGSWOBBLE","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"65%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Simulation, Casual, Unique","id":"EP7072-CUSA35705_00-WOBBLEDOGSWOBBLE","PlusPrice":244.65,"Popularity":"","Title":"Wobbledogs Console Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Secret Mode Limited","ReleaseDate":"2023-05-23","Slug":"wobbledogs-console-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"244.65","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"The game tells the story of a little man named Degroid, who was caught by Mad Doctor.

It features a team of skilled warriors from all over the world who have been sent on a mission to defeat the ever-growing numbers of Ink Beasts. A World Blackened By The Ink Of Ruin The story is set in Ido, city of the morning moon, which continues to fight against the disaster known as the ‘Ink of Ruin.’ The city has a very traditional culture similar to medieval Japan and is essentially a fortress, with its protection coming from a strong magical technology boundary. This boundary resonates directly below the moon shining overhead, keeping everyone safe from being tainted. Will You Take Up This Quest? Tokinokuni, the city's leader, has commissioned a quest for carefully selected individuals from all over the world, known as ‘Ink Destroyers’, to go to the most dangerous areas. They will use their unique powers to conquer the various ‘Ink Beasts’ that are so feared by the people still left wandering at large. Investigate the labyrinths surrounding Ido and use your strength and strategy to guide your team to victory and ultimately conquer this nightmarish darkness. The Enemies You Must Overcome The Ink Beasts are born from the Ink of Ruin's taint. If the living encounter it, they will go mad, become demons or perish, and if the dead encounter it then they will be resurrected to roam and increase their numbers. Their only goal is to destroy and envelop the land with darkness, so you must overcome their stain to free this world once and for all from their destruction. These Ink Beasts will take on the form of many frightening demons and yokai from Japanese folklore and also raise the dead for their dark army, so be sure to strengthen your will before facing this enemy. Key Features -Uniquely illustrated visuals with hand drawn, jet-black ink brush strokes, very reminiscent of traditional Japanese calligraphy. -6 playable heroes pre-programmed into the game, plus the option to create your own heroes with unique individual stats and abilities. -Frightening enemies based off traditional Japanese folklore and Yokai (ghosts, ghouls and demons). -Turn-based battles with various Ink Beasts in the most dangerous areas. 3 ‘front’ characters to engage and attack and 3 ‘back’ characters to defend, support and parry. -Engaging narrative and overarching story to enjoy the successes of your gameplay and reflect upon your losses too. -Immersive and atmospheric soundtrack based on traditional Japanese music, helping to create a captivating story.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/2414/6Z6MbyGsm7MZF0yxW3Q5wF9h.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4293-CUSA32780_00-LABYPS4SIEE00000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP4293-CUSA32780_00-LABYPS4SIEE00000","PlusPrice":419.6,"Popularity":"","Title":"Labyrinth of Zangetsu","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PQube Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2023-04-19","Slug":"labyrinth-of-zangetsu-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"419.60","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"The open skies await as you take the role of a wandering dragon rider in search of a lost civilization!

Lend a hand — literally — so that everything can grow and thrive. Sow, water and harvest your own plants. Raise adorable baby animals. Milk the cows, shear the sheep and go on a truffle hunt with the pigs — all in fun mini- and micro-games. The graphics in Across the Valley have a fantastic hand-drawn style. The grass here is lush and green, and the sunsets are golden. Enjoy the idyllic countryside and relax to the sounds of the atmospheric soundtrack. On your farm, there’s something to do every day. Give your plants and animals plenty of love and care! They’ll reward you with a bountiful harvest. You can use your profits to expand your farm — your planning table will let you see it all easily. Features: Action Point Locomotion System: * No Motion Sickness! With the action point locomotion system, no artificial movement is done! * Each action point is designed carefully to have everything you need within the reach of your hands. * Like: Everything you need to shear a sheep is right at the shearing station within your hand’s reach. * Or: Everything you need to work on the fields is at the tool spot. All tools are in reach of your hands. * You can get to an action point with just a blink of an eye. No button learning: * Do everything with your own hands. No extensive button learning is needed. * To dig up a field, take a shovel with you and grab it with two hands. Then dig the field up like you would in the real world. * To sow out seeds, just grab a seed bowl, grab some seeds from it and throw them on the field. Automatic Micro Games: * Instead of typical minigames that interrupt the game, Across the Valley automatically starts and stops a microgame when you perform an action. * An example: Sowing out seeds will automatically start a “seeding” micro-game when the first seed hits the field. The better you distribute the seeds, the more plants grow. Once the seed basket is empty, the microgame finishes and your plants start growing. Stay busy: * 36 tasks (quests) guide you from the basics of seeding to going on a truffle hunt with your pigs. * Infinite orders keep you busy, even after the main game.

If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"Contraptions\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style. Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels. Features + Solve over 200 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds. + Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it. + Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs. + Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like. Gameplay On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a “contraption” which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. When the level starts “time is frozen”, gravity doesn’t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again. Gadgets Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car. Objectives There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc. The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1611/903ac3051a1c8b056dfb990b0e323721f39ab8674bbbc7c9.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4358-CUSA40925_00-CONTRAPTIONS2EUR","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Puzzle","id":"EP4358-CUSA40925_00-CONTRAPTIONS2EUR","PlusPrice":49,"Popularity":"","Title":"Contraptions 2","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FUNBOX MEDIA LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2023-04-05","Slug":"contraptions-2-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"245.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"61.25","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"/game/109022","description":"Curse of the Sea Rats is a ‘ratoidvania’ platform adventure with lovingly crafted, hand-drawn animations.

Is it a plane? It's falling too fast to be either of those. It's McPixel! A wanna-be hero who keeps getting mixed up in the most unbelievable situations you can imagine. Levels One moment you're stuck in a speeding train headed towards the cliff; the other, you're in a falling plane. Sometimes you need to win an impossible-to-win soccer match, and the other, you're a dinosaur trying to hide from a meteorite. Stuck in a flaming house? Sandwiched between two battling armies? Certainly not a problem for McPixel! 100 levels of fast-paced action are waiting for you! Minigames Sometimes, the usual adventure style will get interrupted by genre-bending minigames. Ranging from racing, shooting, fighting, and sports to even platforming or FPS! The game offers over 20 minigames scattered around the world of McPixel! Coins and stamps McPixel is not all about just saving the day but having fun trying to come up with the craziest possible solutions. And for every solution, you will be rewarded with coins! Find all solutions in a level to get the gold prize and some extra coins! You can use them to unlock new levels! Also, everyone loves coins, right? They're shiny and golden and spinning! No reason not to have some more! McBurg The game takes place in the city of McBurg. Explore the city and find different adventures! Some of the paths in the city are blocked and will require you to spend coins to move forward and access new levels! The city will get populated with characters and items from the levels you already visited as you play. You will also be able to don some of the costumes you found while playing. On the edge of the city upon a grassy hill, you can see a Devolver vault, full of gold, looming over McBurg. So, if you ever need a lot of coins, maybe it's time to pay Fork Parker a visit? Steve Sometimes, during your adventures, you will find Steve. Steve can be in the weirdest and most unexpected of places, and finding him will transport you to the Steve level. Steve is not like McPixel and doesn't specialize in saving the day. He's just some guy, doing stuff. Like fishing, cooking, driving a car, or summoning demons.

With no intel or leadership to support them, these soldiers must fight their way back home before the horrors of war break them. Teamwork and strategy are paramount... Each soldier has their own personality and ideas on what needs to happen next. Some want to investigate what caused the crash that left them in hostile territory, while others want to lay low and wait for rescue. There are even whispers of desertion. You are the “unseen hand” that guides this ragtag group of soldiers to safety and possible rescue. Whether it’s as simple a choice as to which way to go next, or something as serious as how to engage their mysterious foes, every decision you make is serious and significant. Story-Driven Gameplay As your soldiers battle the mental strain of war, you’ll need to command them in combat— will they avoid the enemy, or go head to head with their foes? Unique Turn-Based System Combat is similar to that of a turn-based tactical RPG. Plan your turn in pause mode and watch your soldiers move when action phase starts. However, when new enemies and hazards appear, the game pauses to allow you to plan your reaction to this new change. Will you continue to charge forward or back off and seek cover? Choices Matter Choices you make will shape the story to your liking leading to different campaign endings. Choose wisely as your progression through the game will affect not only soldiers you command but also a whole region and everyone who happens to live here. But you should also keep in mind that your soldiers have their own opinions on what is good for the squad so you have to maintain balance between what you want them to do and what is good for keeping the squad in high spirits.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/3007/rjoeDGW2fbfZ2WXzfLgOugjs.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5733-PPSA05008_00-9319449668698946","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy","id":"EP5733-PPSA05008_00-9319449668698946","PlusPrice":69.9,"Popularity":"","Title":"Broken Lines","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Blowfish Studios Pty Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2022-12-13","Slug":"broken-lines-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"139.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"Take the role of Stella, a teenage girl who moves to a small town only to discover that it’s a secret community of cryptids.

The game adds a layer of tactical combat to the genre by introducing the weapon of choice of musketeers: the musket.

This event damaged the fabric of time and space itself, seemingly beyond reconstruction. You, a Herald, will join a secret interdimensional organization — Herald's Undercover Bay, or simply H.U.B., created by Dharma to remedy the aftermath of the catastrophe; Heated real-time battles: control a Herald — almighty hero created by God. Combine his powerful melee and ranged attacks to vanquish your enemies. Heal carefully so that foes don’t steal your remedy, use movement, various buffs, and debuffs to gain the advantage and defeat your rivals; Customizable hero: implant different organs into the body of your Herald to acquire unique combat enhancers and passive abilities. Gather and equip nodes and runes to make your Herald godlike. Express yourself, create a build that fits your playstyle perfectly, be it companions, throwable weapons, critical or DoT damage and much more; Crafting system: deep crafting systems that allow you to disassemble basic materials and create from received resources unique organs, weapons, gear and consumables that will help you to define your unique playthrough; Vast open world: explore distant lands beyond belief and meet their exotic inhabitants — merchants and bandits going about their lives regardless of where you go.

You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies. Possible alternate history flow - what would have happened if the Allies followed the ideas of Operation Unthinkable and went to war against the USSR in 1946? Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Advanced army manager - choose the composition of your forces. Acquire new units, upgrade or dismiss the outdated ones. Make sure that your forces have all the necessary tools for the upcoming battle. Real WW2 heroes - assign historical personalities to your armies and get access to special skills. Realistic 3D graphics - study the battle map and take advantage of 3D graphics, featuring volumetric terrain and physically-simulated movement of units. Attention to detail - game created by a team passionate about WW2 history.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0910/r28qdLdXatQ9aY1ux0GGRoQl.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA34476_00-8237173962609670","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy","id":"EP4886-CUSA34476_00-8237173962609670","PlusPrice":524.5,"Popularity":"","Title":"Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Klabater","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-22","Slug":"strategic-mind-fight-for-freedom-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"576.95","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"Join BIG I on his exciting journey through the kitchen and make him jump!

Our game gives you the opportunity to set up mirrors and glass pieces to reflect and refract a light beam as you wish. - Our puzzles are open-ended. We give you the rules and the tools, you show us how to solve the problem. We assigned a number of possible solutions to each level but don’t let those numbers fool you - we’re only waiting for the players to find solutions we haven't thought of. - Visuals threading on the thin line between cartoony and realistic. Good pacing. Relaxing music, which lets you zone in. All of that creates a unique, mysterious but warm atmosphere. - When light hits a mirror and it reflects, it hits glass and it bends. That’s all. And yet, it offers thousands of possibilities, which means each of our levels is different and unique. - LIT is extremely intuitive. Testing the game on multiple gaming events proved that it works for all age groups and all types of players. You want to find every solution and beyond? Searching for a game for your 5-year-old?

Live a summer of dysfunctional love through branching storylines, twists, sudden changes, and a special mechanic where you choose which senses to use with your boyfriend. In these moments, you will learn about him, his personality, and his past, making you question everything. Milky Way Prince is a semi-autobiographical story entirely designed, programmed, illustrated, and scored by a young author, Lorenzo Redaelli. \"During my experience with a borderline partner, I thought that falling in love with him was like becoming part of a binary star system. It’s the rarest, most precious thing in the universe – but the closer they get the more unstable they become.\" \"My idea was to create an immersive experience where the player is asked to try to understand the dynamics of this unusual relationship. The character you interact with adapts their behavior to yours – using academic terminology, they could set up “rage tests”, “love bombing\", or otherwise guilt trip you. The plot's branching storyline is guided by variables such as “submission” and \"interest” that fluctuate at each interaction.\"","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/3109/LkJfZKSVEhP8H7WVTwUzyOAx.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4977-PPSA06752_00-1147686809756156","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP4977-PPSA06752_00-1147686809756156","PlusPrice":183.75,"Popularity":"","Title":"Milky Way Prince – The Vampire Star","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FANTASTICO STUDIO SRL","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-20","Slug":"milky-way-prince-the-vampire-star-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"525.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"210.00","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"Join BIG H on his exciting journey through the kitchen and make him jump!

Recruit a company of up to three mortal heroes and guide them in spirit on a desperate journey from Albion to Jerusalem. Explore a richly-imagined medieval setting on the brink of apocalypse. Trade with merchants, improve your heroes and unearth ancient relics. Search for the lost fragments of your soul, scattered across the multiverse - and save as many worlds as you can. KEY FEATURES: A Roguelike Experience Carve a path across the lands of Albion, Marca Hispanica and Al-Andalus. Will you take a dangerous route, risking life and limb in pursuit of a legendary relic? Or will you choose a safer path? Plan and prepare. Negotiate, barter, fight. Tackle challenges. Suffer losses. Recruit new Heroes. Earn Gold, Supplies and Renown. Be careful: your choices are permanent, as is death. But don't tarry - evil never rests. Tactical Turn-Based Combat Master the tactics of squad-based and turn-based combat to conquer both human and demonic foes. Your enemies will be tough and ruthless; make use of high ground and cover, set up ambushes and coordinated attacks, harness synergies between different Hero classes and skills. Non-Linear Narrative Enjoy a compelling story inspired by Arthurian legend, the Matter of France, and the history of Al-Andalus - with an unusual twist. Make choices in interactive encounters that change every time you play. Written by Jonas Kyratzes (The Talos Principle, Serious Sam 4) and Verena Kyratzes (The Lands of Dream, Serious Sam 4). Hard Mode Suited for only the bravest adventurers. Experience an even greater challenge with complex resource management and tougher enemies. Earn Essence with each run that can be exchanged for Blessings and Curses, adding temporary benefits and burden in equal measure to your next run. Dynamic Leveling Use Renown to level up your Heroes, and choose between a randomized set of new skills or improved attributes. But choose wisely! Select skills with great synergy and balance your party for the road ahead. Equipment Upgrades Seek out towns to improve your arms and armor, or stumble upon hermit artisans in the wild. With every day that passes, the world plunges deeper into darkness, and you will need all the equipment gold can buy. Relics From a peasant's humble luck charm to the legendary sword wielded by Arthur himself, items imbued with magical power are scattered about the world. Some you will be able to purchase from merchants and collectors, but others will have to be earned through acts of heroism - or displays of wit. Spells Rain thunder and brimstone upon your foes! Seek out and gather Soulstones to restore your power and unlock new Spells. Even if defeated, your spirit will retain all of your collected arcane knowledge as you jump into the next dimension. Alternate Dimensions As you jump from one parallel dimension to the next, history is reshaped. Different kings rule the land, changing the encounters, characters, and events. No two worlds are ever quite the same, and each journey will be unique. And should your heroes fall, remember: defeat is not the end, only a new beginning. There are as many worlds as there are stars in the sky. In each stands Camelot; in each there is a Grail. But there is only one Merlin, and his eternal burden is to stand against the horror from beyond. Each world that is saved is saved forever; each world that is lost is lost for good.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0131-PPSA04468_00-THEHANDMERLINPS5","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP0131-PPSA04468_00-THEHANDMERLINPS5","PlusPrice":209.8,"Popularity":"","Title":"The Hand of Merlin","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"tinyBuild LLC","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-14","Slug":"the-hand-of-merlin-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":22,"SalePrice":"262.25","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"/game/57479","description":"If you already own the PS4â„¢ version of this game, you can get the PS5â„¢ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

The normal route of business can be, however, disrupted by a number of disruptions: from hacker attacks to error and malfunctions each module and its system entail in your management of the station. Your production may also simply overload, given the production strain - so plan, execute and design to perfection!

Built with a background narrative, each of these missions enable you to focus on the two game modes in order to build your station in such a way as to successfully fulfill their objectives. Are you going to be the most efficient, the most industrious or have the most graphically appealing modules set-up? Anything goes as long as the mission is successful!

Enjoy both the tried-and-true bullet hell experience of the original game and the added features of the twin-stick Over Power mode. You can even compete for high scores online for the very first time. In Rolling Gunner, you are humanity’s last hope in the defence against the now-sentient computer system BAC that is powering and controlling nearly all of the world’s engines and the planet’s population has been reduced by half. Take flight in the space craft RF-42R STORK which carries the Rolling Gun, a special weapon that was built in secret to fight against BAC in the event of a crisis. Rolling Gunner is a tough but rewarding bullet hell Shoot ‘em Up where precise play lets you climb the leaderboards. In addition, you can refine your skills in practice mode and save replays to truly analyse and master the game. Features: • Pick one of three STORK spaceships, each with unique attributes and firing patterns • Navigate across six stages blanketed in a hail of bullets from an unceasing onslaught of enemies and screen-filling bosses • Varied difficulty modes offer the best experience for every skill level • Climb the global online leaderboards and keep the challenge going, even after beating the highest difficulty • The Replay feature lets you analyze your last attempts and Training Mode helps you master the Rolling Gun and the different stages • Beautifully animated cutscenes and a superior, energetic soundtrack by COSIO marry the gameplay and story perfectly The Over Power DLC can best be described as a super expansion, turning the bullet-hell shooter into an even more frantic twin-stick shooter, with a new control scheme and even a new soundtrack, creating a completely different experience that can be selected from the main menu. The titular Rolling Gun can now be moved independently from the ship with the right stick to destroy enemies and projectiles with more precision and a buster beam gun and rechargeable plasma shield are added to the arsenal. Much needed upgrades to the STORK spacecraft as players will find themselves confronted with a ton of additional enemies and projectiles in Over Power.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/0109/yuajld0KunPj9bWcg3Ca0Zb7.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8204-CUSA29459_00-ROLLINGGUNNERXEU","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Shooter","id":"EP8204-CUSA29459_00-ROLLINGGUNNERXEU","PlusPrice":314.7,"Popularity":"","Title":"Rolling Gunner + Over Power","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"ININ","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-31","Slug":"rolling-gunner-+-over-power-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"314.70","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-25","LowestPrice":"","description":"Princess Farmer is a match3 puzzle and visual novel game with easy to learn action mechanics and different difficulty levels that let you breeze through the game or challenge you to earn more rewards.

Please note: DLC must be downloaded separately. It’s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE INFECTED Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/1512/35ead9b7fd1de13c76c33914969c350dc4149e5b7bb0e5d9.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2GAME0000000EU","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Unique","id":"EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2GAME0000000EU","PlusPrice":999999,"Popularity":"","Title":"Dying Light 2 Stay Human","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TECHLAND SP.

You’re not a hero. Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet. There is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective. ABOUT Tails Noir is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation. Tails Noir is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person. GAMEPLAY Tails Noir’s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you. As Howard, you will: • Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth • Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be • Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver • Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss • Be a raccoon FEATURES Post-noir dystopia Tails Noir’s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It’s a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better. Stunning visuals The breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic animals.

NOSTALGIC JOURNEY TO THE PAST When they were young, the Actress and the Director were full of dreams and ambitions. Decades later, the Actress returns to the theatre, to once more become the performer, the audience and the muse. The performances, the letters and the radio interviews - they are all meaningful, but will the Actress find what she's looking for? Attend the last show of a famous artist reflecting on his defining moments and your role in his life. VARIETY IN ARTSTYLE AND GAMEPLAY With each play you will explore a new, incredible scenography, fully painted in VR. Each performance tells the story of different characters, with individual gameplay mechanics and a unique closure. Be a robot escaping a factory or a little, boastful musketeer - every role you take is a medium for emotional experiences of the Director. GRAPHICS MADE WITH VR TECHNOLOGIES To separate the performances from the real world and put the stress on their artistic nature, we decided to reach for new, creative methods of graphic design. The plays’ segments of the game are painted using virtual reality technology.

A mix of retro graphics along with meta-narrative, stealth system and action combat with a high difficulty level. Timothy, a common child, wants to save his grandfather from certain death. The old man fell ill and he's now fighting for his life. Timothy, who loves his grandfather very much, decides to take a risky journey to the infamous Mysterious Forest. Legends speak of a magic mushroom able to cure any disease that grows into the forest. Timothy bravely begins his journey to find the magic mushroom. The game mixes elements from adventure/exploration games with puzzle and stealth: exploration, reading and keeping a slow pace is the best tactic. The high difficulty level is the base: Timothy is basically defenceless and dies with a single touch from enemies or traps. The world is full of ruins, graveyards and tombstones, caves, swamps and weird characters: every place is made to look wild, abandoned and dangerous. Except for Timothy's grandfather, most characters are often mean or clearly driven by not-so-nice feelings.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/1621/GxSFUAnK1bbIMBkNgWWsPRVc.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2696-CUSA25899_00-TIMOTHYPS4V10000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure, Action","id":"EP2696-CUSA25899_00-TIMOTHYPS4V10000","PlusPrice":41.85,"Popularity":"","Title":"Timothy and the Mysterious Forest","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"QUBICGAMES SP.

On her first day at Dudsdale Elementary, 10-year old Jess accidentally gets everybody's favorite collectible card game banned, forcing the kids to take their card battles underground. Troubles arise when mutants from the game invade the real world, and it's up to Jess and friends to stop them. From the award-winning indie game studio, Gambrinous, creators of Guild of Dungeoneering, comes an RPG where battles are played with an epic collectible card game. Cardpocalypse takes you back to the 1990's, a time when computers used floppy disks, and people read magazines for video game cheat codes. You will explore Dudsdale Elementary on a mission to build killer card decks in an effort to defeat the mutants. You will have to trade, earn, wager, change rules and permanently alter cards on your way to victory. • BE A CHAMPION: Build your decks around the ultra rare Champion cards you earn. Each Champion comes with unique abilities to tailor your deck around. First player to get their opponent's Champion card's health to zero wins the match. • GO MEGA: Champion cards evolve to their MEGA forms when their health halves, doing more attack damage and gaining new powers. • CHANGE THE GAME: The kids sometimes use house rules and who knows what the Mutants will change. Throughout the game you will choose the new rules and conditions as well as renaming your favorite cards and giving them upgrades using stickers. Create entirely new cards using the Mega Mutant Power Magazine. But be careful, these decisions are permanent. • GET SCRAPPY: Adventure throughout the school to unravel the strange occurrences at Dudsdale Elementary. Take on quests to earn cards, stickers, and candy which you can collect and trade with your classmates. Careful, there's no backsies! • YOU CAN'T COLLECT 'EM ALL: In the end, your decks and rules will be unique to you. Stickers are rare, choices matter, and sometimes you'll have to make a tough decision to get the best cards. • THE 1990's: Through its totally rad, choice-driven, interactive narrative, Cardpocalypse delivers the experience of being a 90's kid. Boo-ya! • Now featuring Gauntlet Mode! A roguelike mode where every run is unique. Pick your champion and fight your way through ever more difficult battles.

In order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through the use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.

THE GALACTIC WAR Capturing enemy planets, defending against invasions, and completing missions will contribute to our overall effort. This war will be won or lost depending on the actions of everyone involved. We stand together, or we fall apart.","SaleStarted":"2024-09-10","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/2117/3fe5f0891356f4c9988336e68bb9d2b6d29bed389e57cab4.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP9000-PPSA06016_00-HELLDIVERS2SCE00","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action","id":"EP9000-PPSA06016_00-HELLDIVERS2SCE00","PlusPrice":1679.2,"Popularity":"","Title":"HELLDIVERS™ 2 Super Citizen Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-08","Slug":"helldivers-2-super-citizen-edition-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"2099.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"1679.20","IsPS4":0}]
