In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-11","LowestPrice":"/game/68258","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","MainStory":15,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/HP1003-PPSA02532_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":33,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/deathloop","Title":"DEATHLOOP (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-13","Slug":"deathloop-simplified-chinese-english-korean-traditional-chinese-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":468,"MainExtra":22,"SalePrice":187.2,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"88","SaleEnds":"2022-10-26","description":"Reprise your role as a supernatural assassin in Dishonored 2 \u2013 the next chapter in the award-winning Dishonored saga by Arkane Studios.

A world filled with Remnants \u2014 mysterious artifacts from an ancient era. Who created the Remnant? How long ago? And for what purpose? With these questions left unanswered, the Remnants became beneficial tools used for the good of civilization. The world was at peace...or so it seemed. Who was to know such darkness lay in wait? The powers of the Remnants slowly began to change the world's balance. A rift slowly formed between those who ruled and those who obeyed. This was the dawning of a new era \u2014 an era of countless frays that would be brought upon the world by those enslaved by their own lust for power. A thousand years later, the journey of one young man begins. ■Unique Battle System Battle commands for ever changing battle situations. The game introduces a symbol encounter system in which the battle starts by approaching enemies in the dungeon. Giving orders depending on situations according to the conditions of your allies and enemies is of vast importance. With the \"Morale\" system, which displays the strength and morale of each character during the fight, the outcome of the battle will greatly change. Increasing attack power or reducing damage taken will provide beneficial effects to the battle. Besides formations and critical triggers, there are also several other elements in the battle system for you to enjoy. ■Additional Features ・Trophy and share function ・High speed moving function for Rush (protagonist) on the field ・Adjusted texture resolution and lighting via an update ・Changed menu font and facial graphics Copyright: ©2008, 2018 SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD.

We celebrate the lives we've been given, and offer up prayers for the next. It is grief of death which shackles the living, and causes the dead to stray. Indeed, there is no greater affront to reincarnation. So we turn our grief to joy as we send the dead off with smiles. But the souls of those who held back their tears in life still need salvation in death. A duty that falls to the Watchers. Their task is to guide the wandering souls known as the Lost, and serve as keepers of the Living World and the Beyond. The Watchers sever the bonds that tie the Lost to this world, and send them on to the next. They navigate the emotions of the living and the dead. They prize life above all else. This is the story of one Watcher. ◆Features The player takes the role of Kagachi, a Watcher, as he travels between the Living World, the world of the living, and the Beyond, the world of the dead, saving the Lost. To fulfill his duty as a Watcher, Kagachi (the player) battles monsters by allowing Daemons to possess him, giving him access to a variety of job skills and abilities. Kagachi can bind up to four Daemons at the same time and switch between them in real time during combat with one simple press of a button. Each Daemon has a distinctive set of skills, a unique weapon such as a katana, spear, axe or scythe, and a different play style. Switch Daemons in and out of combat strategically to gain an advantage over your foes. ONINAKI has a weapon and Daemon customization system inspired by hack-and-slash games and an incredible amount of replay value.

Mocker wasn't always like this, he just doesn't remember it. One day, he was found in the midst of the Wasteland: he had no armoured car, but he was in good spirits. He didn\u2019t know where he was, but he quickly learned to drive and shoot at the Engineers\u2019 camp. That\u2019s where he got his name and later, during one of the raids, he met the Lunatics. Similar to raiders, Mocker preferred to live for the moment, and the gang was glad to see fresh meat in their ranks. They gave the rookie an armoured car with spikes and shotguns, and then his nickname played with new, frightening colours. The unique armoured car presented in the pack is known for its balance of weapons, combination of modules and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the \u201cPacks\u201d tab, select the desired armoured car and click the \u201cAssemble\u201d button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases up to 57. Attention! Storage overflow is possible under certain conditions. Buying the pack also gives early access to several structural parts. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy. Unique portraits provide an excellent opportunity to stand out among the survivors. Paint cans are a way to make your armoured car different from the pack. Coins \u2014 is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention! When buying multiple packs, the acquired coins stack!","SaleStarted":"2022-10-11","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/1211/vQxBsQUWHoSYw4Hcb1NUat35.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/EP4432-CUSA06859_00-EB00910000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Simulation, Unique","PlusPrice":39,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/1211/vQxBsQUWHoSYw4Hcb1NUat35.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Crossout \u2013 Biter (English Ver.)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"Gaijin Distribution KFT","ReleaseDate":"2022-04-28","Slug":"crossout--biter-english-ver-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":78,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":39,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-10-26","description":"Will you be the Golf Champion?
