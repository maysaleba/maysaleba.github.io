In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness. The game\u2019s cutscenes, quirky cast of characters, and the majestic Pacific Northwest vistas have been enhanced for an experience that delivers as much on its visual impact as its unnerving atmosphere. If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

Players must make quick decisions and choose every action and attack they make, all the while considering their immediate cost and consequences. Featuring a unique blend of strategic time-based action, John Wick Hex captures the feel of the tactical combat from the films and blurs the line between the strategy and action video game genres.

Ammo is finite and realistically simulated, so time your reloads and make the most of weapons you scavenge on the job. Experience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game's eponymous villain 'Hex'.

Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to. Scale Massive Beasts ------------------------------- Overcome impossible odds to climb atop and defeat the massive beasts that are bound to this land. Climb, Glide, Swim ------------------------------- You can climb on virtually anything you can get your hands on, from ruins and mountains to the massive beasts that inhabit the land. Ascend to the tops of mountains and then glide over the open world to reach previously inaccessible locations. Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don't stay in too long or your swim could become your last. Explore, Craft, and Survive ------------------------------- You'll arrive on a frozen island with only the clothes on your back -- it's up to you to survive. Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn't the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait. Make Your Path ------------------------------- Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course. Unravel the Mystery ------------------------------- Why won't the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to. A Beautifully Frigid World ------------------------------- Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog. The remnants of an ancient civilization lie before you, but don't let awe turn into carelessness -- snow storms can crop up at any moment and bury you in a blizzard. Luckily, you can leave footprints in the snow and follow your footsteps back if you are lost.","Title":"PRAEY FOR THE GODS","SaleStarted":"2022-08-27","LowestPrice":"","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"No Matter Studios LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-12-14","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png?w=200","Slug":"praey-for-the-gods-playstation","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1880-PPSA02131_00-3768321134104813","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzDl2THyF4w","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":29.99,"PercentOff":"35%","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":19.49,"SalePrice":19.49,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"45","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/infinity-runner","SaleEnds":"2022-09-01","description":"The Infinity is the largest spaceship ever built by man-kind flung into the void of space to secure humanity a new home amongst the stars.

As well as these evasive elements there\u2019s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations.

Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed. In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.","Title":"Risk System  Bundle  Game + Theme","SaleStarted":"2022-08-27","LowestPrice":"","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"HIDDEN TRAP","ReleaseDate":"2022-07-22","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/2713/PGj2zMGK2iwwGRJVj2gmObRI.png?w=200","Slug":"risk-system--bundle--game--theme-playstation","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3686-CUSA18290_00-RISKSYSTEMBNDLNA","Trailer":"","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":10.99,"PercentOff":"40%","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":6.59,"SalePrice":6.59,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-01","description":"Hazel Sky is a heartfelt adventure about a young engineer facing his destiny and his desires.Sent to an island far from home in the flying city of Gideon, Shane must pass the trials and return as an Engineer or face banishment.

Use stealth and tactics to overcome the never-ending onslaught of monsters, the manifestations of your god's decay. DEFINITIVE UPDATE: ▪ 3 new enemy types. Prepare to fight swarms of feral bats, witches of the wood, and elder vampires. ▪ 30 new weapons with unique abilities to add to your arsenal. ▪ Overwatch added to ease up your ambushes. Snipe any foes running into your range. ▪ Tug of war mechanics. Push a beast into a trap or pull it into the range of ally's overwatch. ▪ Rebalance of corruption system. Cursed weapons and items give you immense power but at a cost of slowly losing yourself. ▪ New questline: uncover dark secrets of House Blackwell. ▪ New hunter skin - hunt in style. FEATURES: ▪ Stealth, ambush-based combat. Try to outsmart and outwit all the horrifying creatures you\u2019ll be facing, as they are way stronger and you don\u2019t stand a chance in a direct assault; ▪ Diverse, challenging opponents. From werewolves to vampires, all monsters have their unique attacks and skills and can easily see, hear or smell you from the distance. So be careful not to reveal your position too early; ▪ Stamina-based characters. Cautiously manage your energy level between attacking, moving and casting spells. In the end, you\u2019re only a human and running out of energy will seriously fatigue you; ▪ A grim world plunged in half-darkness. In this world, our god has finally turned his back on us and his corrupt presence can change the intensity of the battlefield. From summoning monsters, through changing the weather, to transforming one of the creatures into a powerful avatar of his will; ▪ A vagabond\u2019s exploration system. Travel the world bringing your mobile base along with you. Take shelter in and manage your camp, but be wary of enemy ambushes; ▪ A unique fusion of dark Victorian fantasy and wild west. Immerse yourself in a world so different from the one you know. The universe shaped by struggle, where mankind has not had the freedom to develop or advance any of its technology. Manage your scarce resources, venture out with your fellow companions and explore the remnants of the world in search of the means for mankind's survival. Monsters can detect a hunter's presence by their scent, they can then use this to track down where the hunters are. Observe the wind - keeping yourself downwind of your adversaries will aid you in your hunt. Although, hunters can use their scent to their advantage by preparing an ambush using traps, then luring the monsters towards it. Monsters are not the only threat the hunters will face on their hunts - the presence of the old god is growing ever stronger, changing everything it touches. The darkness can summon more enemies against the hunters, or even change them into an avatar of its will. Hunters can equip different weapons, heavy, more powerful ones that will drain their stamina when used. And smaller ones, better for stealth actions. Within their camp, our hunters can craft new items or get some rest. In addition, we can assign roles to hunters there, e.g. to make one of them guard the camp and protect it from ambushes, or to give them the role of a scavenger, who will collect resources in the region of the camp. Remember, this is not the world you know. This is a world that has been shaped by struggle, one where mankind has not had the freedom to develop and advance its technology. Your resources will be limited, and opportunities rare.","Title":"Alder's Blood: Definitive Edition","SaleStarted":"2022-08-27","LowestPrice":"","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"No Gravity Games S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2022-04-28","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202204/0811/3xDrQnV0UuO525rinrdlIOBH.png?w=200","Slug":"alders-blood-definitive-edition-playstation","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6673-CUSA30730_00-0957437476024690","Trailer":"","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"PercentOff":"30%","genre":"Role Playing Games, Strategy","PlusPrice":12.99,"SalePrice":13.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-01","description":"This collection of 2 Little Nightmares games will introduce you to a lovely, frightening, and iconic puzzle-platformer series, starting with the original.

Save your friends. Time is ticking. Alma is an Automaton that awakens to a world in ruin after the war with the humans. Anima, the resource that gives Automatons sentience, is running out and turning Alma\u2019s friends into mindless killing machines, the UNSIGHTED. Key Features: EXPLORE YOUR WAY - The world of Arcadia is massive and ripe for exploration, with many shortcuts to discover and maps both above and below the surface of the world. When one path seems too tricky, find new uses for familiar weapons and tools. RICH AND VARIED COMBAT - Build your perfect loadout to suit your playstyle. UNSIGHTED allows players to equip weapons in various ways, from dual-wielding swords to shuriken and shotgun combinations. Alma will need to use perfectly timed combat actions to trigger faster reload speeds or a massively damaging parry to survive in the city. CRAFT AND UPGRADE - Upgrade Alma through an extensive upgrade tree via chips you\u2019ll find throughout your journey. Chips can be crafted or discovered, and each offers different bonus effects. Experiment with nearly limitless builds from the fast and efficient to the powerful and stylish. CHOICES MATTER - Alma\u2019s withering life force ticks away in real-time and is the driving factor in the story of UNSIGHTED.

The core element of the game is large-scale naval battles with numerous carrier ships bringing so much more aircraft into the battle for seizing control over the ocean. Upon overtaking the sea you will have to set foot on hostile land through a series of costly landing operations. You will have to make your naval, aerial, and amphibious forces act as one flawless mechanism - a task only a truly strategic mind can achieve.

Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. If you can survive long enough to find it.","Title":"Nowhere Prophet","SaleStarted":"2022-08-27","LowestPrice":"","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"NO MORE ROBOTS","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-30","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/2309/XEozUpmOCdLB940sqK9hCvS5.png?w=200","Slug":"nowhere-prophet-playstation","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4256-CUSA19107_00-NOWHEREPROPHETUS","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IadayVADjTw","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":24.99,"PercentOff":"60%","genre":"Strategy","PlusPrice":9.99,"SalePrice":9.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-01","description":"Attention all Seaside Valley bus drivers!

You have an opportunity to participate in building a new village from the ground up and experience first-hand what it was like to create a new settlement. As a newly appointed bailiff, you must decide what buildings to erect and what people to bring in, and you must also settle disputes between the villagers. Each building is unique and comes with its own upgrades, material and labour requirements, so you will face some difficult decisions. A bailiff's lot is not an easy one, but he can still enjoy some fun after a hard day's work. Get yourself one of the new horses available and take it for a ride, throw a few dice against seasoned players in your new local tavern, match your skills against variously skilled opponents in your combat arena or just rest at home in your own comfortably furnished house. 1 player 1MB minimum save size DUALSHOCK®4 Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
