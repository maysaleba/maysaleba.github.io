In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane’s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","MainStory":16,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":35,"genre":"Action","id":"EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","PlusPrice":499.8,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/deathloop","Popularity":"","Title":"DEATHLOOP","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Bethesda","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-13","Slug":"deathloop-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"2499.00","MainExtra":24,"SalePrice":"499.80","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"88","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"Reprise your role as a supernatural assassin in Dishonored 2.

Take advantage of Lilac’s speed with her Dragon Boost, reach new heights with Carol’s Jump Disc or motorcycle, or take a more measured approach with Milla’s shield. And all-new playable character Neera won’t be left out in the cold, as she can use her powerful Frost Arts to punish foes. Like its predecessor, this high-speed platforming adventure delivers exhilarating momentum-based action, but advances the formula with new gameplay systems and enhancements. With 24 expertly designed stages, an ambitiously expanded Adventure mode, retro-but-refined 2D visuals, and the addition of the highly requested Boss Rush mode, Freedom Planet 2 is the indie darling grown up to become a true platforming power.

These weapons and abilities can radically alter the way you play, making each playthrough unique. You must defeat 7 bosses to reach the final boss. Each boss moves and attacks in a unique way that you must learn to exploit if you want to succeed.

Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment. DRIVE TO SURVIVE It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows. INVESTIGATE THE ZONE The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you. REPEAT Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0710/516003921755aa5cb8873cb08c22b172141e997a0d5cd075.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6847-PPSA17476_00-00000000000PS5EU","MainStory":20,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":46,"genre":"Driving/Racing, Action","id":"EP6847-PPSA17476_00-00000000000PS5EU","PlusPrice":629.4,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pacific-drive","Popularity":"","Title":"Pacific Drive","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Kepler Interactive Limited","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-21","Slug":"pacific-drive-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":30,"SalePrice":"629.40","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"77","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"/game/102756","description":"VR Skater is designed from the ground up for VR to give you the most authentic, challenging, and immersive skating game ever.

When you cross paths with the Boy, a small creature whose mysterious powers have attracted the attention of Gemini, the Mistress of the Artifacts, you decide to protect him, unaware that much greater forces are involved. EXPLORE ZENOZOIK Drawing upon both surreal and punk fantasy influences, the world and civilisations of Zenozoik are brimming with fascinating characters, creatures and landscapes. Roam this intriguing land and discover its paths, inhabitants and ancient secrets. CRUSH YOUR OPPONENTS Your fists and speed are your greatest weapons. Attack, dodge, stun, block, counter a parry to land a special attack, switch to first-person view to perform unique techniques: each time, it's up to you to seize the occasion to achieve victory and avoid mistakes that could quickly prove fatal. CUSTOMISE YOUR COMBAT STYLE Learn various martial arts during your adventure and alternate freely between them based on the situation, types of enemies and your preference. Victories will enable you to improve your characteristics and upgrade your attacks, so you can develop your own unique style. RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE RITUAL Before fighting, you can challenge your opponent to a game of dice, with the winner defining the rules of the encounter – often to their advantage. Summoning a monster as an ally, covering the area in fog, having shackles limit movement… far from determining the outcome of the combat, the Ritual represents an opportunity to exploit if you win it or a challenge to cleverly overcome if you lose. A RICH STORYLINE Your search for the Great Artifacts that will help you defeat Gemini will take you farther than you ever imagined. While taking on the mercenaries pursuing you and developing your friendship with the Boy, you must confront your past and delve into the sources of the chaotic society of Zenozoik. Clash: Artifacts of Chaos takes place in the same universe as Zeno Clash and Zeno Clash II, but the game is entirely independent.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0510/bKgCdDnqryZi1HUeYIWmIhXO.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA05057_00-CLASH00000000000","MainStory":11,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":19,"genre":"Fighting, Adventure, Action","id":"EP6665-PPSA05057_00-CLASH00000000000","PlusPrice":0,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/clash-artifacts-of-chaos","Popularity":"","Title":"Clash: Artifacts of Chaos","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2023-03-06","Slug":"clash-artifacts-of-chaos-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1399.00","MainExtra":18,"SalePrice":"349.75","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"77","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"The beloved 1998 RPG Classic, SaGa Frontier, is reborn with improved graphics, additional features, and a new main character!

The Big Boss Bundle brings thrilling DLC to Hotshot Racing for free!

Hotshot Racing is a blisteringly fast arcade-style racing game fusing drift handling, razor-sharp retro visuals and an incredible sense of speed to create an exhilarating driving experience. Developed by racing game veterans SUMO Nottingham and Lucky Mountain Games, Hotshot Racing is an all-new driving experience which revives the classic arcade gameplay of the 90s and thrusts it into the modern era. 16 racing circuits provide the twists, turns and straights conducive to searingly quick racing. Take in coastal, jungle, alpine and Las Vegas desert environments, with each course modelled with the most vivid colours and blue skies for miles. Time Trial and Grand Prix modes cater to those who like to compete in classic racing formats, while ‘Cops and Robbers’ and ‘Drive or Explode’ modes offer exhilarating new ways to play. Each mode is available in single-player, four-player split-screen and eight-player online, while Time Trial is single-player only.

Your hunters will find game to stalk but should beware of wild animals. In time you should begin to hire soldiers to defend against intruders and sinister pirates! On top of that you can use heavy artillery: A catapult can punch devastating gaps in the enemies' ranks! And should you run out of boulders, remember: everything you can lay your hands on can be used as ammo! Intuitive control of the environment helps you move about – you can literally crawl over the island or change your viewpoint like you would zoom on a smartphone. You'll get accustomed to ruling your empire very fast. The islands you visit during the campaign can be unlocked for the sandbox mode. You'll be able to choose whether you want to play entirely without constraints or accept challenges of your choice. Determine the number of townies you start the game with, defeat opponents or fight against thieving pirates – the various settings offer you enough freedom for your personal gaming experience!

Experience: Brush over trees, form clouds into dangerous thunderstorms, go fishing with your bare hands and talk to your townies. Interaction: Simply carry workers or resources directly to their destination to speed up the construction of buildings and production. Fight: Recruit brave soldiers, and build catapults, bows, and crossbows to protect your island from the Black Knight's raiding henchmen.

On the orders of the King, you are charged with striking out to make your mark on an untamed world—building and growing settlements in the face of resistance from raiders, monsters and more. Hold Your Ground is a wave defence custom scenario. Defend your gord against increasingly stronger waves of enemies.

If enemies penetrate your perimeter you need to zoom into close range combat and beat them back, adjusting to a completely different perspective in the blink of an eye. Welcome to Jeff Minter’s Akka Arrh. This modern take from the fine developers at Llamasoft combines the intrigue of an incredibly rare Atari arcade prototype with a unique creative vision that delivers a wave shooter that is insanely addictive. Akka Arrh drips with Minter’s sense of humor, love of psychedelic color, and ability to create games that are a joy to play. Key Features: Pure arcade bliss! You'll be thrown directly into the action where combos, high scores, and survival are your only goals. Create massive chains of enemy explosions and rack up ammo for precision shots to keep a combo and your rings (or life force) protected. Lose them all, and it’s game over. Start from the beginning of the 50 unique levels, or pick up where you left off to power through to the end. Accessibility! Sensitive to flashing lights or just not a fan? Not to worry, as there is an option to disable the more intense visual effects so that the experience can be enjoyed by a wider audience.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/2216/RR6HkCCpeYX65wLfl1vGsP6V.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0182-PPSA10084_00-3651066137094003","MainStory":1,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Shooter, Arcade","id":"EP0182-PPSA10084_00-3651066137094003","PlusPrice":139.6,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/akka-arrh","Popularity":"","Title":"Akka Arrh","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"ATARI EUROPE S.A.S.U.","ReleaseDate":"2024-03-07","Slug":"akka-arrh-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"349.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"139.60","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"73","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"/game/94132","description":"ENDLESSÃ¢„Â¢ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESSÃ¢„Â¢ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her \"unusual\" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESSÃ¢„Â¢ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again.

Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory? The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat. Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world. - Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries. - Permadeath. All characters that die in combat will stay dead – unless they return as the undead. - All characters come with their own background stories and traits. Want a stuttering ratcatcher, a greedy witch hunter or a drunkard disowned noble? - Character development without a restrictive class-system. Each Character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks. - Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills – split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer. - Diverse enemy roster. All enemies have unique equipment, skills and AI behavior. - A dynamic event system with atmospheric encounters and tough decisions outside of combat. - Three late game crises – a war between noble houses, a Greenskin invasion and an undead scourge – add a looming threat. - Two full hours of orchestral soundtrack.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/0114/duK8hFPWukslgpBlrUFQV6Me.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3736-CUSA28064_00-BATTLEBROTHERSEU","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Strategy","id":"EP3736-CUSA28064_00-BATTLEBROTHERSEU","PlusPrice":499.5,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/battle-brothers","Popularity":"","Title":"Battle Brothers","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"UKIYO PUBLISHING LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2022-01-13","Slug":"battle-brothers-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"999.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"499.50","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"71","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"Dive into a transformed vibrant post apocalyptic Hope County, Montana, 17 years after a global nuclear catastrophe.

Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable.

The message confounded Orochi scientists. Their analysts broke it down and determined it was of intelligent origin. Orochi management immediately concluded that the discovery was too sensitive for public knowledge and moved to keep it hidden. In secret, the corporation began construction of Trailblazer Alpha, a state-of-the-art Mars research outpost designed to identify the true nature of the message. You are Shane Newehart, an engineer stationed at Trailblazer Alpha and your security clearance means you are completely unaware of the existence of the mysterious signal. Your job is simply to keep the lights on until the transport ship Cyrano arrives bringing with it a new team to take over your duties. Soon you discover strange and unusual setbacks. Crucial systems are malfunctioning, the greenhouse is filled with a strange mist and the rest of your team has yet to return from their EVA mission. Things are starting to fall apart. You begin seeing and hearing things that aren’t there. Visions, hallucinations – or is that even what it is? Is this real… or are you slowly descending into madness? Experience true cosmic horror With your only hope of rescue hundreds of thousands of miles away, you will be forced to explore the real-world fears of isolation and paranoia, enhanced with supernatural elements and cosmic horror. Terrifying visions and monstrous apparitions will make you question what is real and what is not as the very fabric of reality threatens to tear at the seams.

IMPORTANT HEALTH WARNING ABOUT PLAYING VIDEO GAMES Photosensitive seizures A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these “photosensitive epileptic seizures” while watching video games. These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eyes or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects. Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms – children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures. The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions: sit farther from the screen, use a smaller screen, play in a well-lit room, do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued. If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1202/z5tGmstkqZ5YZ8U4DvKNcpbZ.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0700-CUSA11932_00-LOA0000000000001","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Unique","id":"EP0700-CUSA11932_00-LOA0000000000001","PlusPrice":209.8,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/twin-mirror","Popularity":"","Title":"Twin Mirror","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"DON'T NOD ENTERTAINMENT SARL","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-30","Slug":"twin-mirror-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"209.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"60","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"From the creators of SENRAN KAGURA, experience a fresh, colorful racing extravaganza with Kandagawa Jet Girls!

Airstrip DLC It is more story-driven than what we did in the past and it allows you to build a small airstrip close to your gas station. Meet Joe Joe is an old pilot flying an old single engine plane. He is a bit strange and one day approaches you to help him with his endeavours. For that he needs a place to land in the middle of nowhere to make a stop halfway to his destination. In return he is willing to cut you in on his deals. The Airstrip You have plenty of space and as it turned out, there used to be an old military landing strip during WWII close to your gas station. Should be that hard to make it work again, right? You might even go a step further, order some aviation fuel and some parts for planes. A windsock wouldn’t probably hurt and some lights might turn out to be useful, since you will on occasion also need to help him land. Let’s see how things develop and what Joe is up to... The Plane Joe’s plane is like its pilot: old. It’s also simple. The most advanced technology on this thing is the LED reading light Joe uses to find his way on the chart. How hard can it be to fix some simple things on a small plane? And it’s not like you are doing it for free. The Gameplay The Airstrip DLC brings new game mechanics and content to Gas Station Simulator based on events.

Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.","SaleStarted":"2025-01-28","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Adventure, Music/Rhythm","id":"EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","PlusPrice":105,"Popularity":"","Title":"ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Untold Tales S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-09","Slug":"atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"525.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"105.00","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-12","LowestPrice":"/game/99199","description":"What Lies in the Multiverse is a story-driven 2D adventure that one could call a dramatic comedy.

With help from your robot assistant, you will appraise, value, buy and sell a vast array of items. But remember: there are no umbrellas allowed. AVAC will be watching… No Umbrellas Allowed is set in a futuristic sci-fi dystopia where greed is a crime and the emotions of the populace are suppressed by a drug called 'Fixer', which is administered via rainfall. Through a series of strange events, you find yourself in the position of manager at a well known second-hand shop called Darcy's. By learning the tools and tricks of the trade - and with some help from a loud-mouthed robot assistant - you must earn money, raise the shop's reputation, and pay off your debts, all while trying to avoid any unwanted attention from AVAC (Association for Victims of Avarice Crimes). EVALUATE: Customers will bring you a wide variety of items they want to sell, from the mundane to the marvelous. Use tools to discover an item’s true value: worthless junk or precious rarity? HAGGLE: Once you’ve decided an item’s value, you can negotiate a price for it. Try to strike a balance between keeping the customer happy and ensuring a deal is as profitable as possible for Darcy's. PROFIT: Procured items can be displayed for sale in the shop’s showcase. The rule of Darcy’s is buy low, sell high. But don’t get too greedy. Ajik City is not the place for flagrant avarice. REPUTATION: Consistently offering good item appraisals, good recommendations, and good deals all positively raises the profile of Darcy’s and brings more customers into the shop. Be good at your job.

The methodical combat requires that you plan your attacks, dodges, blocks, and parries while considering your opponents and the environment. Death is permanent but you can improve your stats and purchase items to aid future lives. And if things get too tough then up to four local friends can grab controllers and aid the hero as player-controlled monsters, zombies, and bandits. The World Large, procedurally generated, and interconnected lands range from plains to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons, you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area’s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items. One must choose carefully though; every god has a different price and some become displeased when their rival is the subject of worship. Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians. Variety Scores of weapons, items, spells, and mementos are scattered throughout the world to find. One may acquire a powerful enchanted ballista early into one life, only for the next to yield nothing more than a couple of wooden clubs. Mementos represent objects remembered from past lives and change the rules of gameplay. You may discover a memento that summons spiders from enemy corpses, improves your stats while on fire, or reverses the effects of death. There are multiple paths to victory. One could be nimble and stealthy, charge in waving a hammer, raise an army of undead, harness a variety of spells, manipulate enemies into traps or flames, amass resources to acquire the most powerful items, or simply play it safe with a sword and a shield. The various characters simply offer different starting points, every decision is your own. Challenge No life is predetermined for success. The cheery graphics disguise a brutal and unyielding experience. Unforeseen obstacles will need to be dealt with in real time and even a regular enemy will be deadly if you’re not careful.

Snow Bros. Wonderland is the newest chapter—and boy, has a lot changed in the last couple of decades! For starters, the graphics aren’t two-dimensional anymore; the new game offers a gorgeous 3D isometric style. Armed with an endless supply of ice pellets, gamers can turn monsters into snowballs, which can be kicked to destroy whole hordes of foes! Attacks can be chained to take down multiple enemies at once, and your snowball skills will be put to the ultimate test against some truly massive bosses. Are you (snow)man enough to defend Snow Land from evil King Atchich? FOUR TIMES THE FUN Previously, Snow Bros. was always a two-player game (which makes perfect sense given the name), but this time, the number of players has doubled! Now, you can have up to four players at once, making the adventure even more fun to experience. After all, shared joy is double the joy, and quadrupled joy is even better! Oh, and did you know that you can also customize your snowy avatar with hats, goggles, scarves, and all kinds of fun stuff? Find your own style! THE HISTORY OF SNOW BROS The first game in the chilly, snowy Snow Bros. saga was released in 1990, featuring two snowman brothers, Nick and Tom, who rolled snowballs, jumped on platforms, and defeated enemies in a quest to rescue the princesses Puripuri and Puchipuchi. Four years later, the sequel, Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves—a game as quirky and bizarre as it was wonderfully entertaining—was released.

The corridor seems endless, but something is wrong—objects shift, things are not as they should be, and the deeper you go, the more unsettling the anomalies become. With every step, you feel an unsettling presence growing closer, as if the hospital itself is hiding something from you.

Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the unlucky girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay The main goal is conquering the bigger portion of the screen. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield depletes. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and the required conquered area percentage for the victory. Key Features - 8 unlucky girls in need of help - 32 levels with unique bosses and minions - Absurd stories that will reveal details about the bosses and the girls - Fully animated, Japanese and English voice overs for all the characters! - Lovely graphics! - Traps, towers, crates and bonus effects - Arcade Mode - Live high scores displayed for hardcore players - Nostalgia remastered! Stories Have you ever asked these questions to yourself: How do you stop a heartless but not soulless emperor? Can someone be a gyroscope and a guard dog at the same time? Why do those ducks attack us? Are there really demonic headphones in the world? Why do lizardmen need a plastic toy for summoning their god? How do you become a villain after revolting against the ant queen? What do scientists want from Albert the wonderful sea creature?

The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE INFECTED Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202501/3116/28d7764d5b63480bbda55a6c368eeaebed3afb9bcff95d51.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2DIGITALEXTRAS","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Horror, Adventure","id":"EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2DIGITALEXTRAS","PlusPrice":577.17,"Popularity":"","Title":"Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Digital Extras Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TECHLAND SP.

You assume the role of Stella, who was born on the ship 24 years ago and recently inherited her father's post as Chief of Security. Dive into the conspiracy behind the incident that threatens to disrupt the Zephyr's social order and foil its mission. Between Horizons is a modern 2.5D pixel art adventure that brings a branching narrative into a semi-open world. The team at DigiTales has applied numerous lessons from their first game Lacuna and proven solutions to detective game design problems to maximize player agency in the investigation process – all the while maintaining the tight pacing of a meaningful story that will ask you to reevaluate your moral compass and make increasingly tough decisions as the situation aboard the ship spirals out of control. - A New Kind of Experience: Between Horizons merges investigative-style gameplay with a branching sci-fi story in an ever-expanding Metroidvania-style environment. - Solving cases for yourself: The flexible evidence system lets players assign clues to cases, confront ship denizens about them, and submit any case with evidence players have connected to it. Everything found on the ship is connected, but figuring out how — that’s the challenge. - At What Cost?: Underneath the game's exciting and plausible sci-fi plot lies a number of thought-provoking problems inviting players to weigh intergenerational responsibility against personal freedom. - Getting New Perspective: Timeless pixel art mixed with 3D environments and compelling visual effects come together in Between Horizons, creating a unique, beautiful art style. - Failure is Very Much an Option: There are no second chances — submitting wrong solutions means the story will go on and players live with the consequences. A new and improved auto-save system will make sure there is no going back, as the story branches and endings are based on player decisions, none of which can be taken back.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202407/0514/c5f07a34575f40fad7c6d54220f7847bac634cdd0f34adbe.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5470-PPSA08031_00-2536471118846637","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP5470-PPSA08031_00-2536471118846637","PlusPrice":279.5,"Popularity":"","Title":"Between Horizons","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Assemble Entertainment GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2024-09-18","Slug":"between-horizons-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"559.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"279.50","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4Ã‚Â® version and the digital PS5Ã‚Â® version of this game.

Since then, they’ve created a dystopian city where developing super powers is a crime. Nobody has managed to slow them down, until now. Capes is a turn based superhero strategy game where you build a team of heroes and fight to take back the city. Played across a series of campaign and patrol missions, choose to push forward with the story or take the time to explore the side missions and unlock more heroes, earn skill points and complete challenges, and learn more about your heroes lives. BUILD YOUR TEAM Recruit new heroes with a range of unique powers and abilities. Every hero plays differently, and requires a fresh approach to their powers and abilities. Learning and exploiting each hero's unique play style will build their power in combat allowing them to unleash their personal tide turning Ultimates. TURN BASED TACTICS Exciting, heroic, turn based combat to test your strategic skills. Team ups and positioning matter, unlocking new ways to approach every enemy type and supervillain you encounter. Capes combat isn't based around random numbers or lurking behind cover. Power doesn't make you invulnerable, far from it. Your choices will make the difference between victory and defeat. TEAM UP! Take up to 4 heroes to work together in each mission. Each hero gains a unique team up ability from each of their allies, allowing them to work together to take advantage of their unique powers. UPGRADE YOUR POWERS Level up your heroes to gain access to new abilities and powerful upgrades. Use Skill Points acquired from completing objectives and challenges to unlock their powers. CHALLENGE YOUR HEROES Complete collections of hero specific challenges during missions to earn bonus Skill Points and unlock optional missions that give a deeper insight into each of the heroes.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/1010/baef23d0d984326120a46bdca7b8d0e885a24489a4d72a01.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8923-PPSA16244_00-CAPES000000EUPS5","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy","id":"EP8923-PPSA16244_00-CAPES000000EUPS5","PlusPrice":909.35,"Popularity":"","Title":"Capes","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Daedalic Entertainment GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2024-05-29","Slug":"capes-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1399.00","MainExtra":16,"SalePrice":"909.35","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"Dual Entitlement: F1Ã‚Â® 24 Champions Edition includes both F1Ã‚Â® 24 PS5 and F1Ã‚Â® 24 PS4 Buy* F1Ã‚Â® 24 Champions Edition and receive: Ã¢—ï¿½ 2x New My Team Icons: Juan-Pablo Montoya & James Hunt Ã¢—ï¿½ F1Ã‚Â® World Bumper Pack Ã¢—ï¿½ 18,000 PitCoin Be One of the 20 with EA SPORTSÃ¢„Â¢ F1Ã‚Â® 24, the official videogame of the 2024 FIA Formula One World ChampionshipÃ¢„Â¢.

Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don't get into the critical range. This task is made more difficult by a dynamic weather system, day/night changes and a multitude of randomly generated events, where you never know in advance how they will end. Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last. Choose one of three characters with different skills and background stories and start by climbing the first mountain. Search crates, caves and ancient ruins for equipment from past adventurers. You'll need it, because even the first mountain will demand everything from you. But don't worry. As time goes by, you'll become stronger and stronger. Take advantage of a sophisticated skill system to determine which strengths your climber should have. In the course of each of the three mysterious stories, you will meet dangerous animals, overcome deadly abysses, encounter sinister and well-meaning characters, who do not always have to be human. Here, too, each of your decisions decides the following events. Three mountains have to be conquered at the end. One higher and deadlier than the previous one. Divide your forces and your equipment correctly, because you don't have a second attempt and you can forget about learning a route. In Insurmountable you have to cope with unknown dangers, react spontaneously to unpredictable events and realize in the end that, as in life, you can't always know the consequences of your decisions, but you have to cope with them anyway and in the end, it often turns out differently than you thought. Face the challenge of ever new and changing dangers, face snowstorms and the sheer force of nature, always keep your eyes on the summit and overcome the insurmountable.

Slay hordes of creatures on the scorched sands of Purgatory and sell their gold-stained corpses to craven priests. Kill magnificent bosses and use the proceeds to gain entrance to Elysium, a place of cosmic revelations. You are amyetri, a corporeal spirit condemned to live a shadow life in the halfway realm of Purgatory. Bring an end to your suffering by initiating the Rites of Orpheus and defeat the chthonic deities that dominate your fractious path to Elysium. THE DEPRIVED INITIATE Begin your journey with nothing but a broken sword. Only danake, the blood-soaked currency of the underworld, will afford you equipment better suited to tackling the Dismal Lords that stand between you and Elysium. RISK VERSUS REWARD The revenant creatures of Purgatory are consumed by the same hunger for gold danake that motivates your own quest. Falling to your enemies will cause you to lose your acquired wealth. Deposit your danake in the Pantheon before you die, or continue your run to Elysium and risk losing it all. STRENGTH IN ASSEMBLY The underworld is a lonely place. Muster up to three friends and carve a gold-soaked path to Elysium together. Deploy co-op specific gear and gadgetry to support, defend and revive each other on the perilous path towards eternal oblivion.

As you play, you'll feel yourself reaching for your dice and miniatures. It's time to dive into the world of Solasta! Roll for initiative, take attacks of opportunity, manage player location and the verticality of the battle field. Set yourself up for the finishing strike and possibly roll a natural 20 at that key moment of a battle. In Solasta, you take control of four heroes, each with unique skills that complement one another. Every hero expresses themselves in the adventure, making each action and dialogue choice a dynamic part of the story. Players will create their heroes just as they would in a pen-and-paper game by choosing their race, class, personality, and rolling for their stats. You make the choices, dice decide your destiny. An Epic Team Adventure Discover the shattered world of Solasta. Explore ruins and dungeons for legendary treasures, learn the truth of an age-old cataclysm—and stop it from happening again. Create your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. Tailor your squad to your preferred strategy and maximize your party's abilities. The choice is yours. Online Multiplayer Co-op Play any campaign with up to 4 players for more fun and shenanigans! The best part? The host shares all their DLC with the other players! Time to fireball some friends. Discover a Mysterious & Dynamic World Delve into long-forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. Fight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over—on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground. Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. Size also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though—the monsters are also thinking vertically. Custom Campaigns In Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the official campaign is over. Download and play new Custom Campaigns with friends, made by the community with a push of a button! From the room layout, monster composition, and treasure the party will find, down to the decoration and lighting of each room or the music track playing—everything is handcrafted with love and care.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0816/adcba6a68e07cdb12b1a1dd453cb29a6ad6a6a368464a899.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5789-PPSA17744_00-0141723598888133","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP5789-PPSA17744_00-0141723598888133","PlusPrice":314.7,"Popularity":"","Title":"Solasta: Crown of the Magister","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TACTICAL ADVENTURES","ReleaseDate":"2024-03-06","Slug":"solasta-crown-of-the-magister-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"419.60","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"Grab your torches and jump into the World of Solasta with the Lightbringers Edition!

In this dark fantasy adventure you solve intricate cases and unveil abysmal secrets as Inquistor Mordimer Madderdin. The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality, inspired by the bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Konigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation. Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy’s weak points against them.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/2214/ULouZNFHNgrQorotB3Zre4sC.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA10961_00-000THEINQUISITOR","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP4365-PPSA10961_00-000THEINQUISITOR","PlusPrice":524.3,"Popularity":"","Title":"The Inquisitor","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Kalypso Media GMBH","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-08","Slug":"the-inquisitor-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"749.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"524.30","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"Dead Hook is an explosive mix of rogue-like and shooter genre with brutal combat and captivating storytelling.

But what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart. Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic EvilnessÃ¢„Â¢. Features: • Everything is better with DwarvesÃ¢„Â¢: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources. • It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! • Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. • New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. • Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. • Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. • Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. • Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together. All maps from the skirmish mode and the campaign are playable in co-op.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0312/cc9b9859c73692c8ddbb19f5d922c0598070db16cb0b86de.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA07937_00-DUNGEONS40000000","MainStory":25,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":34,"genre":"Strategy","id":"EP4365-PPSA07937_00-DUNGEONS40000000","PlusPrice":1224.3,"Popularity":"","Title":"Dungeons 4","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Kalypso Media GMBH","ReleaseDate":"2023-11-08","Slug":"dungeons-4-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1749.00","MainExtra":34,"SalePrice":"1224.30","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4Ã‚Â® version and the digital PS5Ã‚Â® version of this game.

Your adventure begins on a distant island, deep in a tropical Archipelago. What was once a prosperous tourist destination is now a shade of its former glory: and it’s your job to bring it back to life! Explore the Archipelago, meet the locals, and lend them a hand to restore the tourist paradise… while you try to uncover the mysteries of your past! SETTLING IN A NEW PLACE Your tropical life will be a busy one, so grab your tools and let’s get started! First things first: you’ll need a source of food, a place to spend the night in, and some resources to build a farm and kickstart your tropical journey. So what are you waiting for — time to explore your lands! A PLETHORA OF ACTIVITIES There’s plenty to do in Spirit of the Island! No matter how you choose to spend your time, you will gain experience and improve your skills, unlock new recipes, and become more efficient at everything you do, which will make your new life easier. Spirit of the Island features 10 unique skills, such as farming, mining, foraging, social, and even fishing, which comes as its own special mini-game. Will you become a true master of all? YOUR JOURNEY TO A TOURIST PARADISE Make your island not only a welcoming home but also a booming tourist paradise, with fancy shops and landmarks. The more tourists you get, the better your economy will be, which is a crucial step to fund your journeys to the faraway Islands. But how do you please them all, and what do you sell in your stores? That’s where your skills will come in handy! Sell local produce; open museums to display the treasure and secrets you uncover on your adventures. We bet some of your visitors could even buy a couple of quality wooden planks, so do your best to improvise! THE BEST TRIP EVER Each tourist will have a chance to love your Island so much that they’ll decide to stay, adding to the Town’s population. This part is crucial since you can hire them to do various things for you, such as tending to your shops and helping you maintain the Island. So do your best to make their trip a fantastic one! THE POWER OF TWO One of the main features of Spirit of the Island is a 2-player cooperative mode, where you can do… everything together! You will have all single-player mode features available in online play with its own unique story. Grow crops, set up a store, and sell your produce to tourists, explore the vast Archipelago, and discover the secrets of the tropical paradise together with a friend! VAST TROPICAL ARCHIPELAGO Spirit of the Island features 14 explorable islands, each with its own fauna, secrets, and dangers. Information on who - or what - inhabits these islands has been lost to history, but you will find mysterious caves guarded by ancient creatures — are you brave enough to explore them and uncover the mysteries within? Doing so will net you neat rewards and help you proceed towards your final goal: revealing the secret of your past. THE LOCAL COMMUNITY The Archipelago is bustling with life! Meet more than 14 unique characters, each with its own distinct traits and quirks. And yes, there are romance options as well! Depending on your character, you’ll be able to romance and marry different NPCs and hold a grandiose wedding in the end! AN EVENTFUL LIFE One of the unique features of Spirit of the Island is events — a series of recurring occurrences happening through each in-game year (4 months). They will come in various forms: from birthdays and traditional Holidays to your own unique events. There’s always something fun happening in Town, so make sure to check your calendar often!","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/1615/jfTgsNhsgDDUp0kpRg2yoevL.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1302-PPSA13934_00-0584770477306422","MainStory":31,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure, Simulation, Party","id":"EP1302-PPSA13934_00-0584770477306422","PlusPrice":437.5,"Popularity":"","Title":"Spirit of the Island","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Plug In Digital","ReleaseDate":"2023-10-19","Slug":"spirit-of-the-island-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"875.00","MainExtra":38,"SalePrice":"481.25","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4Ã¢„Â¢ version and the digital PS5Ã‚Â® version of this game.

Tackle challenging encounters with your party of two characters, using a variety of skills and highly interactive environments. Maybe you'll light an enemy on fire and kick them into a grain field for a proper barbeque, or set up a trap and fell a tree on top of them. The options are endless, and you're the one in charge! You have control over time The core of Iron Danger is its unique time control mechanic. You can rewind time up to 5 seconds whenever you want, trying different strategies and combinations of moves until you find the right one for the task at hand. The time manipulation allows us to combine real-time combat gameplay with controls from more traditional, tactical turn-based combat games. This gives tactical combat a puzzle-like element, as you can keep trying new approaches to turn impossible odds to your advantage and synchronize the actions of your characters for the perfect outcome. You will die, but you will not fail! Iron Danger is set in a world of lofty fells, primeval forest, and placid lakes...as well as living gods and monsters of steel. The city of Kalevala, home of the humans who rebelled against the gods and forsook their protection, shines in the middle of this world, surrounded by towns, sea lanes and woodlands under its protection. But from the frozen north, a witch queen is leading her army on a quest for vengeance against the lords of Kalevala. Ancient ruins from the days when gods dwelled on the earth are opening to unleash forgotten powers, tempting humans and striving to overtake the world. You’ll take on the role of Kipuna, a sharp-witted village girl, who becomes imbued with an ancient power that grants dominion over time and death. You must use your wits to control it as you’re drawn into a war between the city of Kalevala and the armies of the Northlanders driven by their witch queen Lowhee. Your task is to master the power, in order to use it for mankind’s protection, while your enemies seek to harness it in the service of total destruction.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2114/58030e86a07917a7b43b63059fa93780a7b7c79e428eb767.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8923-PPSA12357_00-IRONDANGEREU0000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"90%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Role Playing Games","id":"EP8923-PPSA12357_00-IRONDANGEREU0000","PlusPrice":69.9,"Popularity":"","Title":"Iron Danger","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Daedalic Entertainment GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2023-08-16","Slug":"iron-danger-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"69.90","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"Puzzle, action, friendship!

When Polly returns home after a few years abroad, to look for her missing mother, she quickly realizes that her hometown has drastically changed. A megacorporation named MK is using its power to control the population, and her community is in danger. She soon discovers that she has a gift of clairvoyance that connects her to Reverie, the realm of the Aspirations of Humanity: Glory, Bliss, Power, Chaos, Bond, and Truth. In this world, Polly becomes Harmony, an Oracle who has the power to choose the Aspiration that will ultimately rule over Reverie and restore the delicate balance between the deities’ world and ours. The fate of humanity is at stake. To which destiny do you aspire? DECIDE YOUR DESTINY As Polly, or Harmony, each action you take will affect both worlds and send you down sprawling narrative paths. See into the future and explore the consequences of possible choices in the Augural, a game board and visual representation of Polly's gift of foresight. In pursuing whichever destiny you desire, you’ll also bond with and obtain crystals from the Aspirations. These will unlock different paths at important crossroads that will change how the thread of the story unravels, and ultimately the fate of humanity. FIND THE NEW HEART OF HUMANITY Whichever Aspiration comes to lead Reverie, with Harmony’s help, will also become the heart of humanity.

DELVE INTO THE LORE Evil has been vanquished. Peace has returned to Ancardia, and the peasants dare to dream once more of prosperity. Seven very different factions vie for control over the cataclysmic aftermath left behind by Andor Drakon’s defeat. And somewhere, deep down in an inhospitable cave, ChAoS is stirring again. Pick up your blade, prepare your spells, check your daggers and ready your bow, for you are about to enter the ominous Caverns of Chaos. Choose your allegiance carefully, for you are nothing more than an expendable asset to the masters you choose. Fight for a mercenary's glory and purse, for the justice of a folk in decline, for the light of purity or even for ChAoS itself. Every choice you make will determine how you approach the ever-changing Caverns of Chaos before you.

Abducted, at the mercy of a ruthless scientist, and stalked by a horrible creature, you must try to escape using common sense, just as you would in real life. Can you get out of Oxide? It all starts when you wake up in the bathtub of a motel room, naked, wounded, and unsure what has happened. You remember that the deal had gone wrong, but now the only thing that matters is trying to escape from that horrifying place no matter what. From this moment on, everything you do will lead you to one of the endings. And we warn you that, out of all the ways it could end, there’s only one good way out… There are many options and ways to solve situations, as well as different paths. Some actions will lead you to states that will alter your perception of the environment and even to an abrupt outcome. Remember that a bad decision can be the difference between life and death. • It's your choice! Matthew has gotten this far by making bad decisions. Decide carefully as your actions will affect how the game plays out and ends. It’s up to you to get out of there alive… or not. • Interact with virtually anything as you would in real life. Search for resources, maps, clues, or something to defend yourself with. The Night Soul Motel is full of things you can use. • A shocking story. Getting out of there is not going to be an easy task and finding out WHAT OXIDE IS will be a challenge. Someone is playing with you, but what’s behind all this? • Game over? Every time the character dies, either accidentally or at the hands of the motel’s dangers, you will reappear in the bathtub of room 104, but everything has a price… • Great replayability. Your actions and decisions will affect the end of your adventure, so each game will be a challenge as you have many different options to explore.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/2410/Iq10RAFZxq0PKmbEylLuuWM5.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3877-CUSA31638_00-OXIDE104BASEGAME","MainStory":3,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"85%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Horror, Action, Adventure","id":"EP3877-CUSA31638_00-OXIDE104BASEGAME","PlusPrice":131.85,"Popularity":"","Title":"Oxide Room 104","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Wild Sphere S.L.","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-16","Slug":"oxide-room-104-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"879.00","MainExtra":4,"SalePrice":"131.85","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"The Game of Life 2 is the sequel to Hasbro's board game, The Game of Life, played by over 50 Million players worldwide.

To survive, you’ll need to combine fast-paced parkour moves with strategic dodges as bullets fly your way.

Most people live in megacities that rely on the labor of poor masses to sustain a modern standard of living for the few at the top. With the Earth scorched, water is liquid gold, and control of it is the truest form of power. Forced to cope with a permanent water shortage, ordinary people persist and toil in the hope that if they work hard enough, they too can someday swim every morning in the refreshing pools of the Gardens. We follow the story of Josephine Lace, a young hydraulic engineer eager to climb the corporate ladder and claim a spot at the top. Until the day when that promising future is ripped away from her, leaving her half-dead and homeless, she becomes hellbent on taking down the system that ruined her and left her without a heart. Along the way she meets a diverse group of people sympathetic to her cause, every one with secrets of their own. With their help, perhaps she will find redemption, love, and most of all - vengeance.

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be.

A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/oiWObCmIi2HWJ2AUnHfc7P7a.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCODELUXE000000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"82%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Adventure","id":"EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCODELUXE000000","PlusPrice":272.87,"Popularity":"","Title":"Sherlock Holmes Chapter One Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-15","Slug":"sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-deluxe-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"2099.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"377.82","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"Stranded Sails – Explorers of the Cursed Islands is an open world, exploration and farming adventure full of quests and discovery!

In 1639 BC a powerful explosion devastated the Minoan civilization and sunk the birthplace of their empire: the volcanic island of Thera.

Hidden in the depths for several millennia, the island of Thera is full of historical treasures to collect and mysteries to decipher.

Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You’ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You’ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows? Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They’ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You’ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it. Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you'll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1322/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3236-PPSA04698_00-5793122806301854","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Horror","id":"EP3236-PPSA04698_00-5793122806301854","PlusPrice":737.4,"Popularity":"","Title":"VISAGE","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SadSquare Studio Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-10","Slug":"visage-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1229.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"737.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"/game/100017","description":"Play Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, then pre-order its full-size follow-up Tiny Tina's Wonderlands!

[The Story] Mt. Hikami was once revered as a spiritual place. It housed a unique religion based on beliefs and customs of worshipping water as a deity and is said to have been a site of many gruesome incidents and mysterious phenomena. This mysterious and intertwined story follows three protagonists—Yuri Kozukata, Miu Hinasaki, and Ren Hojo—as each of them explores the ominous Mt. Hikami, a place where many came to die, and the secrets it hides. [Gameplay] Players use Camera Obscura, a special camera capable of repelling vengeful ghosts and sealing away their powers, to explore Mt. Hikami and the numerous incidents that took place there in the past. The story is divided into separate missions, and each mission is led by a new protagonist. In addition to sealing the evil spirits that attack you, Camera Obscura can be used to reveal other things that can’t be seen with the human eye and will help in the recovery of lost items. [New Elements] - Improved screen resolution - New outfits and accessories - New Snap Mode where you can freely place characters and spirits for creative shots - Updated Ghost List - Updated controls and more.

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality. In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.

Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life. Ã£€Å Main FeaturesÃ£€‹ Ã¢–Â  Exploring with new field actions! Ryza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively. Ã¢–Â  More action-filled real-time battles! Take on your enemies using an improved “real-time tactics” battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever.

Guide your agency through the space race and write your alternate history of space travel - any of the agencies can be the first to land on The Moon if you make the right choices. Manage the numerous challenges faced then and now: • Create your base with launch pads, research labs, astronaut training facilities, and much more • Construct your own custom vehicles from hundreds of combinations • Launch satellites and crewed spacecraft to explore the Solar System • Run mission control as you solve the various challenges of turn-based missions to earn scientific advancement and public support • Explore an extensive tech tree and compete or collaborate with other agencies to plot your roadmap to Mars • Choose from five unique space agencies, each with their own traits, base, vehicles, and spacecraft • Create your own custom space agency You’re in charge of every element of the journey into space: success rides on your decisions. Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet? Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies? Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars. Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors. Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment. These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue? Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We’ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5277-CUSA18418_00-0000000000000000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy","id":"EP5277-CUSA18418_00-0000000000000000","PlusPrice":157.25,"Popularity":"","Title":"Mars Horizon","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Secret Mode Limited","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-17","Slug":"mars-horizon-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"157.25","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4Ã¢„Â¢ version and the digital PS5Ã¢„Â¢ version of this game.

Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You’ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You’ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows? Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They’ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You’ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it. Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you'll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1322/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3236-CUSA20582_00-SSVISAGEGAMEPACK","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Horror","id":"EP3236-CUSA20582_00-SSVISAGEGAMEPACK","PlusPrice":737.4,"Popularity":"","Title":"VISAGE","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SadSquare Studio Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2020-10-31","Slug":"visage-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"1229.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"737.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"Cube Raiders is a fun puzzle game for one or two players where you have to combine groups of dice using the energy of MagnetoGloves to solve puzzles.

Join TY on a RIPPER of an adventure to free his family from the DREAMING and stop the nefarious evil genius BOSS CASS from removing mammals from the top of the food chain. To help you on your quest, you've got a BEAUT arsenal of boomerangs, sharp teeth, and the help of a few friends! So don’t be a galah - let's head down under, and have a CORKER of a time! BEAUTY, BOTTLER, BONZA! * Explore 17 levels of the Australian Outback in their old-school 3D platforming glory * 13 different boomerangs including the Frostyrang, Flamerang and powerful Doomerang * Improved camera & graphics; including updated shadows, reflections, HD resolutions and 60fps * New Gamemode called \"Hardcore Mode\" * New TY character skins * Audio Director's cut * Over 35 Trophies, including a Platinum Trophy, plus Speed Run and Time Attack Leaderboards. * * * * * G'day mate! Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open! Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie. Now let's get down to brass tacks, find those Talismans, and rescue your family!","SaleStarted":"2025-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1404/yxKq7R9s7eOf0aAyJvubLHnS.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5633-CUSA18068_00-7582797769000001","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"65%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP5633-CUSA18068_00-7582797769000001","PlusPrice":330.75,"Popularity":"","Title":"TY the Tasmanian Tiger HD","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"KROME INTERACTIVE","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-25","Slug":"ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-hd-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"945.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"330.75","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-02-26","LowestPrice":"","description":"The story take place in an old castle that has become a summer school.

In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system. This game fits best for... - People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work - Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids - Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding - Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about ‘wasting their time’ (although we believe you shouldn’t feel guilty at all while playing games!) - Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun - Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it - People who like smart cats Learn how machine learning works in real life! The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don’t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required! Train yourself into a data science wizard! Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen. Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist! Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you’ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do! Coding just got real! Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right? Improve your gear, improve your life! Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you’ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it’s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe! Fun fact: this is what machine learning specialists actually do.

Born into a new world where biological humanity is extinct but human culture lives on in a city of robots, you find yourself swept up in a mind-bending adventure involving a mysterious megastructure hiding enormous powers. The more you discover, the more you will be confronted with questions about the nature of the cosmos and the purpose of civilization. The broken promise of a better tomorrow, the fear of repeating humankind’s mistakes, faith in reason or renouncing humanity altogether - the choices you make and the sides you take will determine the course of events. A New Generation of Puzzles Solve a wide array of puzzles with varying difficulty levels, including clever metapuzzles and highly challenging Gold puzzles. Finish the game without solving every puzzle, or pursue the rewards of complete mastery. A variety of new abilities, such as gravity manipulation and mind transference, join the established mechanics of the original Talos Principle, creating a fresh but familiar experience. A Philosophical Odyssey Take the next step forward in the story of The Talos Principle in a thought-provoking, character-driven interactive story with multiple endings penned by returning writers Jonas Kyratzes (The Eternal Cylinder, Clash: Artifacts of Chaos) and Tom Jubert (The Swapper, Subnautica), joined by Verena Kyratzes (The Hand of Merlin, Serious Sam 4).

In this dark fantasy adventure you solve intricate cases and unveil abysmal secrets as Inquisitor Mordimer Madderdin. The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation. Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy’s weak points against them.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0813/6c0abbadb6ee8ae04ec8ba8c2b225bedacea0bd6a8733cd9.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA10961_00-0THEINQUISITORDX","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP4365-PPSA10961_00-0THEINQUISITORDX","PlusPrice":629.3,"Popularity":"","Title":"The Inquisitor - Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Kalypso Media GMBH","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-08","Slug":"the-inquisitor-deluxe-edition-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"899.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"629.30","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-05","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product includes both the PS4Â® and PS5Â® digital versions for download.

Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise. But what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart. Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilnessâ„¢. Features: • Everything is better with Dwarvesâ„¢: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources. • It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! • Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. • New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. • Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. • Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. • Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. • Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

Following the arrest of a prominent community leader, New York stands in disarray. Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as ‘Shard’ spreads throughout the underworld. With the city’s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city’s fate. Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to die… unless you decide they must. Key Features: Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it’s sneaking through levels or attacking head-on Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle A reactive story where the player’s choices have real consequences Stylized pixel art environments and characters Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley Gameplay: Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them. Tackle encounters in lethal, high-octane combat, or use your wits to stick to the shadows, utilizing distraction techniques and non-lethal attacks to reach your objective. Augmentation: Unlock cybernetic upgrades to augment your abilities via upgrade trees, and build upon your playstyle to improve your stealth or increase the lethality of attacks through talent trees. Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground. Reactive Story: Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld. Crush entire factions or convince them to aid your cause. Your destiny is yours to write. The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2520-CUSA23292_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"90%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP2520-CUSA23292_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","PlusPrice":62.9,"Popularity":"","Title":"Disjunction - Digital Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-27","Slug":"disjunction-digital-deluxe-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"62.90","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-05","LowestPrice":"","description":"Lose Your Head Bundle contains a powerful combination, almost guaranteed to make your head pop!

Stealth Inc 2 tests both your brain and your reflexes over 60 varied levels linked together in a sprawling overworld. Death is never more than a few moments away, but one of the few advantages of being a clone is that death isn’t all that permanent. With no loading screens and no lives to worry about, players are encouraged to use their inevitable demise as a learning tool as they navigate lasers, homicidal robots and terrifying bosses in the ultimate hostile work environment. Explore the expansive PTi facility, including six distinct areas littered with tests to complete and secrets to collect. Solve puzzles with help from six gadgets that are unlocked as you play, allowing you to do everything from teleporting across entire levels to hacking robots that patrol the facility.
