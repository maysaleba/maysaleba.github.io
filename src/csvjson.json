He's grown prudent, amicable, kind and caring, without any intention to cause major mayhem just to further his own selfish ends. It seems he is far from chaining himself to flaming saw blades, training torpedo-dolphins or foraging through platypus nests. Or is he? Ultimately it's a flaming saw blade grounding Goal on Deponia again. By accident, her consciousness gets split into three parts and stored to three different discs. Now it's on Rufus once again to convince all three parts of Goal, utilizing his remarkable charming wits, to become one again, venture to Elysium with her and save Deponia from certain doom while he's at it.

Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's novella At the Mountains of Madness, but largely set after the original story. You, as Frank Gilman, open your eyes inside a room filled with strange, pulsating noises. Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you\u2019re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near the South Pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister... Explore the Antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues and unlock secrets, whilst avoiding macabre beings at all cost. Key features: A deep and suspense-filled Lovecraftian story with lots of secrets and Easter eggs. Ominous but wonderful graphics created with Unreal Engine 4. Multiple endings. A haunting and atmospheric soundtrack.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rogue-bit-switch/hero","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"60%","Price":"4.99","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","SalePrice":"1.99","MexPrice":"39.99"},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2021-12-03","Title":"Rock 'N Racing Bundle Off Road & Grand Prix","LowestPrice":"3.99","SaleStarted":"2021-11-14","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

Power up your abilities by making new social connections. - Loaded with dorky humour and 90s magical girl anime tropes. Battle Flow: Due to your overwhelming power levels, the enemies can't actually hurt you, so the focus is on defeating enemies as quickly as possible to gain higher rewards and bargaining power when the battle ends. Of course, not all enemies are brainless zombies, and you'll have to contend with many abilities designed to impede your pursuit of a perfect score! Social Links: Outside of battle you'll be able to invest your precious time and money into building up your social links through visual novel style conversations: - Help the convenience store clerk find romance! - Try to lure out the NEET who lives in the storage cupboard! - Waste all your money on gacha machines to try and impress a small child! Negotiation: How the heck are you supposed to have a social life with no money or free time? After every battle you'll get to lead the Union of Magical Girls in collective bargaining to determine your reward based on how well you fought and how many gems you gathered.

It's like a human's essence that can\u2019t be measured by a staged photo. And thus Glittering Sword is not that kind of game that some may think judging by screenshots or trailer. On the first glance it looks like typical action-adventure, like many other classic titles from the 90's. Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it\u2019s shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: «fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher. We hope that players who are addicted to adventure games will fall in love with this small but very entertaining game.","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"ChiliDog Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-05","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/hero","Slug":"glittering-sword-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/glittering-sword-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"45%","Price":"4.99","genre":"Puzzle,Action","SalePrice":"2.74","MexPrice":"60.92"},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2021-12-09","Title":"Go All Out!","LowestPrice":"2.59","SaleStarted":"2021-11-18","description":"When you're fighting, be sure to Go All Out!
