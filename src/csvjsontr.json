If you want to be fancy you can wear the skins of tall goats, stripey goats, and many more.

You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating \u2013 the 1990s \u2013 Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. \"IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN\" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen\u2026 In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others.

To contemplate one's life means to knock oneself down, to stop, to begin to go over one's experiences, to discard the superfluous and unnecessary, to destroy the old in the hope of constructing the new, in other words, to be undermined. It is impossible not to note the severity of this word because this action is associated with pain, loss, the need to choose difficult routes, and sometimes taking risks so as not to make new mistakes and not to fall off the set path. But is it worth enduring the pain? What happens if we simply go with the flow? How will our lives turn out then? The French philosopher Albert Camus asked similar questions in his famous essay \"The Myth of Sisyphus. In brief, the ancient Greek myth is as follows: the gods condemned Sisyphus, because he was too arrogant and too dodgy, to roll a huge stone up the mountain, which kept falling and had to start all over again. It would seem that what could be worse than this useless work? What was Sisyphus thinking as he climbed to the top of the mountain? And what do we care about him? Maybe we should admit that our lives are a bit like this Sisyphus? Approach Albert Camus's thoughts and feelings, his philosophy. Perhaps you will find some answers to these difficult questions. \u2022 Explore the world around you and find philosophical notes. \u2022 Take the stone to the top, higher and higher, and if it falls, well, start over, that's your punishment. \u2022 Choose your path correctly. Your decisions will determine the end of the game. \u2022 Discover the philosophy of Albert Camus.

Create a greenhouse to sell crops in early spring. Buy new and used special agricultural machinery to quickly harvest and sell crops before their expiration date. Optimize costs and employ seasonal workers only during the harvest time. Accept challenges from neighbors to prove who is the best farmer in the area. You do not want to cultivate typical wheat, don't you? Perhaps you would love to have an orchard with apples, strawberries or cucumbers? In Farm Tycoon you can have more than 20 different crops that you can cultivate by hand or using machines, where each harvest has a precise expiration date. Before you plant your seedlings, first remember about the proper preparation of the land for cultivation. Watch your plants as they grow from green, fragile seedlings up to the state of flowering, ripening and ready for harvest. Do not forget about watering in periods of drought. If plants are not cared for properly they become ill, lose their quality and eventually die. On the machine market you can buy both new and used agricultural machinery. You have a choice between nearly 40 machines. Remember that cheaper, used machines can break down more quickly, especially when inexperienced employee operates the machine. Before buying your first agricultural machine, build a garage to ensure sufficient space to park it. A real farm is not just about agriculture fields. You can choose from more than 40 buildings, starting from farm buildings and barns to processing plants and factories. Has the plague affected your harvest? Maybe it is time to invest in a factory? Build a specialized factory to process what you have managed to grow. Produce juices and frozen food. Have you produced too much sheep's, cow's or goat's milk? Start producing cheese or butter, unless you prefer to switch your farm for the production of meat. The cultivation of plants is not enough? Farm Tycoon allows for breeding animals. Starting from the smallest such as bees, rabbits or turkeys, but you can also breed goats and cows. Be sure to provide them with adequate animal feed and skilled caregivers. Raise newly purchased animals before they begin to produce eggs or milk. Bees love buckwheat and colza, so create fields with suitable plants nearby. When the animals get sick you will need to call the vet, and if you want to breed your animals, you'll have to call the inseminator. Face variable weather conditions such as drought or torrential rain and collect all the crops before the first frost and snow. Look for a rainbow during a gentle rain or watch the lengthening shadows, changing sunlight and color depending on the current season. At any time you can enter the photo mode to take spectacular shots of your farm bathed in warm autumnal colors, or in a dark scenery during a lightning storm in the background.","SaleStarted":"2024-08-13","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202312\/0513\/aa1e3008b8b5be3cc8120bc5b4c5157beab5645f3c2b4ebc.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP1549-PPSA20238_00-CLABS1FT20231109","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Educational, Simulation, Strategy","id":"EP1549-PPSA20238_00-CLABS1FT20231109","PlusPrice":1259.4,"Popularity":"","Title":"Farm Tycoon","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PlayWay plc","ReleaseDate":"2023-12-15","Slug":"farm-tycoon-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"2099.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"1259.40","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-08-28","LowestPrice":"","description":"Manage your own farm in the game Farm Tycoon!

In Farm Tycoon you can have more than 20 different crops that you can cultivate by hand or using machines, where each harvest has a precise expiration date. Before you plant your seedlings, first remember about the proper preparation of the land for cultivation. Watch your plants as they grow from green, fragile seedlings up to the state of flowering, ripening and ready for harvest. Do not forget about watering in periods of drought. If plants are not cared for properly they become ill, lose their quality and eventually die. On the machine market you can buy both new and used agricultural machinery. You have a choice between nearly 40 machines. Remember that cheaper, used machines can break down more quickly, especially when inexperienced employee operates the machine. Before buying your first agricultural machine, build a garage to ensure sufficient space to park it. A real farm is not just about agriculture fields. You can choose from more than 40 buildings, starting from farm buildings and barns to processing plants and factories. Has the plague affected your harvest? Maybe it is time to invest in a factory? Build a specialized factory to process what you have managed to grow. Produce juices and frozen food. Have you produced too much sheep's, cow's or goat's milk? Start producing cheese or butter, unless you prefer to switch your farm for the production of meat. The cultivation of plants is not enough? Farm Tycoon allows for breeding animals. Starting from the smallest such as bees, rabbits or turkeys, but you can also breed goats and cows. Be sure to provide them with adequate animal feed and skilled caregivers. Raise newly purchased animals before they begin to produce eggs or milk. Bees love buckwheat and colza, so create fields with suitable plants nearby. When the animals get sick you will need to call the vet, and if you want to breed your animals, you'll have to call the inseminator. Face variable weather conditions such as drought or torrential rain and collect all the crops before the first frost and snow. Look for a rainbow during a gentle rain or watch the lengthening shadows, changing sunlight and color depending on the current season. At any time you can enter the photo mode to take spectacular shots of your farm bathed in warm autumnal colors, or in a dark scenery during a lightning storm in the background.","SaleStarted":"2024-08-13","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202312\/0513\/aa1e3008b8b5be3cc8120bc5b4c5157beab5645f3c2b4ebc.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP1549-CUSA46014_00-CLABS1FT20231005","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Educational, Simulation, Strategy","id":"EP1549-CUSA46014_00-CLABS1FT20231005","PlusPrice":1259.4,"Popularity":"","Title":"Farm Tycoon","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PlayWay plc","ReleaseDate":"2023-12-15","Slug":"farm-tycoon-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"2099.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"1259.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-08-28","LowestPrice":"","description":"Arietta of Spirits is a charming adventure game with emotion-filled narrative, no-filler gameplay, and fast paced combat.

Continuation War: the Reds return with a total strength of 1,500,000 - almost half of the entire Finnish population - and the Finns stop them again. Finland\u2019s survival in these two brutal wars against an enemy so vast was a true historical miracle. A miracle of heroism and valor. A miracle of the Finnish spirit of liberty. Experience heroic struggle and make tough choices You are the commander of the scarce Finnish troops. Your only goal - to save your homeland and your people from total annihilation. Would you risk losing your experienced troops to try and capture the enemy tanks? Would you try to save the stragglers during the retreat and risk losing everyone, or cut your losses and establish a new line of defense? Would you agree to negotiate with the Soviets that had treacherously attacked you twice before? Play two campaigns: historical and \u201Cwhat if\u201D Historical campaign: Play through a number of missions throughout the 1939-1945 timeline, spanning three wars: Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War. The historical campaign will have smaller-scale but action-packed operations, covering all of the iconic historical battles. Complete numerous objectives grounded in history and narrated by a number of historical characters. Alternate history campaign: Play a shorter campaign with larger operations, centered around the \u201Cwhat if\u201D events.

ENDLESS™ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESS™ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her \"unusual\" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESS™ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die\u2026 a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again.","SaleStarted":"2024-08-13","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202301\/0605\/NqS2wkRWsphmkL2kpu5seE0W.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP0177-PPSA02665_00-ENDLESSDELUXEEU0","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Action","id":"EP0177-PPSA02665_00-ENDLESSDELUXEEU0","PlusPrice":1311.75,"Popularity":"","Title":"ENDLESS™ Dungeon Last Wish Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SEGA EUROPE LTD","ReleaseDate":"2023-10-17","Slug":"endless-dungeon-last-wish-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1749.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"1311.75","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-08-28","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

Tackle challenging encounters with your party of two characters, using a variety of skills and highly interactive environments. Maybe you'll light an enemy on fire and kick them into a grain field for a proper barbeque, or set up a trap and fell a tree on top of them. The options are endless, and you're the one in charge! You have control over time The core of Iron Danger is its unique time control mechanic. You can rewind time up to 5 seconds whenever you want, trying different strategies and combinations of moves until you find the right one for the task at hand. The time manipulation allows us to combine real-time combat gameplay with controls from more traditional, tactical turn-based combat games. This gives tactical combat a puzzle-like element, as you can keep trying new approaches to turn impossible odds to your advantage and synchronize the actions of your characters for the perfect outcome. You will die, but you will not fail! Iron Danger is set in a world of lofty fells, primeval forest, and placid lakes...as well as living gods and monsters of steel. The city of Kalevala, home of the humans who rebelled against the gods and forsook their protection, shines in the middle of this world, surrounded by towns, sea lanes and woodlands under its protection. But from the frozen north, a witch queen is leading her army on a quest for vengeance against the lords of Kalevala. Ancient ruins from the days when gods dwelled on the earth are opening to unleash forgotten powers, tempting humans and striving to overtake the world. You\u2019ll take on the role of Kipuna, a sharp-witted village girl, who becomes imbued with an ancient power that grants dominion over time and death. You must use your wits to control it as you\u2019re drawn into a war between the city of Kalevala and the armies of the Northlanders driven by their witch queen Lowhee. Your task is to master the power, in order to use it for mankind\u2019s protection, while your enemies seek to harness it in the service of total destruction.","SaleStarted":"2024-08-13","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202306\/2114\/58030e86a07917a7b43b63059fa93780a7b7c79e428eb767.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP8923-PPSA12357_00-IRONDANGEREU0000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"90%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Role Playing Games","id":"EP8923-PPSA12357_00-IRONDANGEREU0000","PlusPrice":69.9,"Popularity":"","Title":"Iron Danger","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Daedalic Entertainment GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2023-08-16","Slug":"iron-danger-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"69.90","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-08-28","LowestPrice":"","description":"Puzzle, action, friendship!

There ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We\u2019ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What\u2019s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you\u2019d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin\u2019 booze is pure fun, but if you\u2019re makin\u2019 money too - now that\u2019s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You\u2019ll be managing workers who\u2019ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you\u2019ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner. You will progress through main missions, you\u2019ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises... If you\u2019ll be prospering, you\u2019ll get the chance to create and manage bases in five different regions, each with its own, more and more challenging missions. From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there\u2019ll be a pesky agent who\u2019ll want to work with you, and there\u2019ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You\u2019re a free man, after all. That\u2019s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax\u2026 after all, ain't nothin\u2019 illegal \u2018til you get caught! Features: [*]a faithful reflection of the moonshine craft - fermentation and distillation based on chemical formulas behaving as natural processes [*]a realistic recreation of an American moonshiner\u2019s business, with all its challenges [*]a rich story - 3 possible successful endings or a \u201CGame Over\u201D if caught by the authorities [*]5 regions - running the base in the mountains, forest, swamps, town, and city, with linear progression [*]70+ recipes - 15+ moonshines, 15+ whiskies, 20 brandies, 20+ vodkas [*]50+ ingredients - sugars, fruits, vegetables, and grains [*]35+ apparatuses - 17 distillation stills, 8 fermentation tanks, 5 post-distillation tanks, 7 pre-fermentation apparatuses, and more [*]26 fermentation and distillation technologies [*]37 main quests + side quests and road events [*]Original Score - 19 tracks that embrace the vibe of illegal activities in American mountains.

And with the addition of new current-gen features it's even easier to play. - Battle Mechanics Polished to a Shine by a Legendary Studio Known for Fighters: The first original fighting game from Dimps, known for being involved in a number of other fighting games.

A large-scale natural disaster struck the eastern area of a nation. It wiped out the financial sector and resulted in a staggering loss of life. At the dawn of the 21st century, the conglomerate PROBE-NEXUS, commonly known as Probe, began reconstruction efforts in that eastern area. Colossal capital and cutting-edge technology was poured into rebuilding it. Skyscrapers that put the old high-rises to shame along with the world's biggest shopping mall and recreational facilities. This was the dazzling birth of a symbol for the new century. It was christened Zone Prime. And now, in an undeveloped sector of its western block, there was an area known as the slums... - Additional Characters: ・Greed A survivor of the illegal fighting organization \"Valor\". He joined the tournament \"F.F.S.\" again in order to fight against a yet-to-be-seen strong fighter. ・Hazama A new president of the PROBE-NEXUS, ostensibly to support the new chairman, Beatrice. But behind the scenes, he is working in the dark to extend his own power. ・Beatrice A granddaughter of Mr. Brad. And after his retirement, she succeeded him as Chairman of PROBE-NEXUS.

R. R. Tolkien or whether you are exploring The Lord of the Rings for the first time, the Precious Edition offers an even more immersive game experience. This edition includes: - The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ base game. - The Sindarin VO DLC, which adds a touch of authenticity to dialogue with the Elves. - The Lore Compendium DLC, a treasure trove of information about the game's key characters, locations and events, taking you deep into the history of Middle-earth. - The Original Soundtrack application so you can listen to the game soundtrack whenever you want. - The Art Exhibition application that takes you behind the scenes of the game creation process with lots of sketches and development secrets. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ is an official adaptation based on the literary works of J.R.R Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose\u2026 How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring ™, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself\u2026 or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn't break; he bends, he adapts\u2026 Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It's up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","SaleStarted":"2024-08-13","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202305\/1516\/cec5fbb61cd4453f65ef3a79fd63af8b8b7548cb22c91c4f.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG00DELUXE00001","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG00DELUXE00001","PlusPrice":499.8,"Popularity":"","Title":"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ - Precious Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2023-05-25","Slug":"the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-precious-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"2499.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"499.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-08-28","LowestPrice":"","description":"\"OctoCurse is an action platformer following the story of a pirate captain who has been turned into an octopus by an evil spirit.

Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin\u2019s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind\u2019s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra\u2019s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra\u2019s discoveries as she learns more about her family\u2019s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra\u2019s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player\u2019s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra\u2019s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn\u2019t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE\u2019s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE\u2019s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.","SaleStarted":"2024-08-13","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202301\/0312\/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Adventure, Music\/Rhythm","id":"EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","PlusPrice":105,"Popularity":"","Title":"ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Untold Tales S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-09","Slug":"atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"525.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"105.00","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-08-28","LowestPrice":"","description":"A new jigsaw puzzle game to remember a beloved classic story.

You look around and see a giant poster that explains the general movement. This way you learn that you are able to dash while being in the air. You also realize that you have a grappling gun in your hand and see floating crystals above your head. You aim at the crystals and use your grappling gun to hook onto them. Once hooked you start swinging and swing towards the next crystal. You hook on to the next crystal and have already mastered the main movement mechanism. After a couple of hooks, you realize that you can change your swinging direction and speed by dashing into the wanted direction. This is the second important thing to learn about the movement and gives you a lot of freedom in your movement. Soon you will reach the next giant poster which explains further movement patterns that you can use to improve your precision and movements. You learn that you can remove your grappling hook, use an in-air dash and then hook on to the next floating crystal to build up speed and energy. You can use this energy to collect hidden achievements, dash through activator crystals, that unlock new areas o the level, or speed run levels later on.

Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don\u2019t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can\u2019t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don\u2019t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren\u2019t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it\u2019s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, in most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can\u2019t sell what you don\u2019t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don\u2019t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn\u2019t your cup of tea, we don\u2019t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.","SaleStarted":"2024-08-13","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202208\/1009\/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-GASSTATIONSIM0EU","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Simulation","id":"EP6300-CUSA31829_00-GASSTATIONSIM0EU","PlusPrice":454.35,"Popularity":"","Title":"Gas Station Simulator","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"MD GAMES SA","ReleaseDate":"2022-10-19","Slug":"gas-station-simulator-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"489.30","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-08-28","LowestPrice":"","description":"Previous special offer price valid from 10-11-2023 to 13-11-2023 was (£7.99 \/ \u20AC9.99 \/ AU $12.47 \/ BGN 19.95 \/ CZK 264.5 \/ DKK 74.5 \/ HUF 3545 \/ NZ $17.47 \/ NOK 99.5 \/ PLN 44.5 \/ SEK 104.5 \/ USD $8.99 \/ ZAR 179.5 \/ HRK N\/A \/ INR 749 \/ TRY 99.5 \/ ILS 39.5) This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!

The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor \u2014 the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You\u2019ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall \u2014 a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there \u2014 a horde of relentless zombies. DAY\u2019S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT\u2019S FOR THE DEAD Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems\u2026 fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it\u2019s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let\u2019s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame.","SaleStarted":"2024-08-13","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/img\/rnd\/202106\/2908\/HSg5GbvwYMeUj770IcWrHmsi.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-ULTIMATEEDITIOEU","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Unique","id":"EP2911-PPSA02262_00-ULTIMATEEDITIOEU","PlusPrice":1574.3,"Popularity":"","Title":"Dying Light 2 Stay Human \u2013 Ultimate Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TECHLAND SP.

The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won\u2019t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King\u2019s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter\u2019s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King\u2019s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose. \u2022 The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty.

Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet.

The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™\u2019s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings.

In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness.

History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

Three Stories Make a (W)hole Piece together the full story of how humanity fell through three distinct sources - Details from the lone golfer\u2019s story, who's come back to Earth for one last game.

The 1% Killed the Radio Star Be accompanied by a purposefully composed soundtrack as well as personal stories broadcasted on Radio Nostalgia From Mars. The station caters to citizens of Mars, nostalgic for Earth as they listen to music from the 2020s, and dial in to share their memories of the planet. A smooth voiced radio DJ keeps the show flowing with updates and announcements hinting to a not so glamorous life on Mars. Fits Like a Glove Three distinct modes mean every golfer can find something for their tastes. Casual players can focus just on the story and a relaxing scenic round of golf in Story Mode. Those looking for an extra challenge can beat each hole under par using skill and puzzle solving through Challenge Mode. While the total pros can try Iron Mode, where there\u2019s almost zero room for error. Easy to grasp controls and a minimalist UI underpin the whole game so anyone can easily pick up and play at their own pace.

Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders \u2013 split between Generals, Pilots and Captains \u2013 is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow. FEATURES Classic turn based, hex based gameplay with an intuitive UI and great depth. Play in dynamic campaigns with unit carryover and multiple \"what-if\" scenarios. A rich 3D world with detailed animations and effects 20 different Specializations give a unique feel to each faction including Banzai Charge, Bushido Code and even the Manhattan Project. Over a thousand different unit types, including infantry, tanks, ships and aircraft, each with unique visuals and animations Attach unique commanders to your units to give them additional offensive and defensive bonuses A deep but intuitive supply system allowing breakthroughs & encirclements.","SaleStarted":"2024-08-13","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202105\/1812\/6vfDdBCOEsxM7cwPshdYlmYB.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP4136-CUSA14680_00-OOBWWII000000001","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy","id":"EP4136-CUSA14680_00-OOBWWII000000001","PlusPrice":139.8,"Popularity":"","Title":"Order of Battle: World War II","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Slitherine","ReleaseDate":"2021-08-19","Slug":"order-of-battle-world-war-ii-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"139.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-08-28","LowestPrice":"","description":"Help the little bee to discover all foods flavours.

WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects\u2019 minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion.

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before! NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them! EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...) There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor.

Set during what the historian Antony Beevor called 'Hitler's Last Gamble', Battle of the Bulge provides an immersive experience on a tactical\/operational level, putting the player in command of the Allies or the German forces fighting each other in several scenarios in one of the most brutal and wild environments of Western Europe: the snow-covered forest of the Ardennes! Command infantry, mechanized and armoured units in hard fights through the various phases of the offensive, taking into account the nature of the terrain and its effects on the assailants and defenders. Time will be another factor not to underestimate. In Battle of the Bulge, scenarios have a time limit with several 'semi-historical' events affecting your conduct of operations in different ways. 1-2 players HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

For that he needs a place to land in the middle of nowhere to make a stop halfway to his destination. In return he is willing to cut you in on his deals. The Airstrip You have plenty of space and as it turned out, there used to be an old military landing strip during WWII close to your gas station. Should be that hard to make it work again, right? You might even go a step further, order some aviation fuel and some parts for planes. A windsock wouldn\u2019t probably hurt and some lights might turn out to be useful, since you will on occasion also need to help him land. Let\u2019s see how things develop and what Joe is up to... The Plane Joe\u2019s plane is like its pilot: old. It\u2019s also simple. The most advanced technology on this thing is the LED reading light Joe uses to find his way on the chart.

In this dark fantasy adventure you solve intricate cases and unveil abysmal secrets as Inquisitor Mordimer Madderdin. The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500\u2019s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal \u2018the truth\u2019. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it\u2019s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation. Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy\u2019s weak points against them.","SaleStarted":"2024-08-20","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202311\/0813\/6c0abbadb6ee8ae04ec8ba8c2b225bedacea0bd6a8733cd9.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP4365-PPSA10961_00-0THEINQUISITORDX","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP4365-PPSA10961_00-0THEINQUISITORDX","PlusPrice":674.25,"Title":"The Inquisitor - Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Kalypso Media GMBH","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-08","Slug":"the-inquisitor-deluxe-edition-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"899.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"674.25","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-09-04","LowestPrice":"","description":"Mustache in Hell is a comical twin stick action game.

Originally released during the golden age of arcade gaming in the late 1980s and early 1990s, these games have become cult classics among retro gaming enthusiasts. Image Fight, released in 1988, set the standard for the franchise with its challenging gameplay and impressive graphics that were cutting-edge for their time. It startet off a short series renowned for it's crearive combat mechanics and immense level of difficulty. In 1992's Image Fight 2, you'll experience even more action-filled gameplay and engaging features. Featuring stunning fully-voiced cutscenes, the game puts you in the role of a sci-fi anime protagonist. X Multiply, a spin-off of the Image Fight series released in 1989, takes the gameplay and perspective in a different direction: A switch from top-down to side-scrolling action. The overall theme changes just as radically with its unique setting taking place inside the human body; a biological world filled with microscopical organic enemies and obstacles. It's known for its challenging gameplay and powerful graphics - including tentacles featuring physics-based animations - which were among the best you could find in arcades at the time.

Captain Maja\u2019s misfit crew must heist their impounded ship and mount a rescue. Guide the crew across islands of a post-flood world known as \u2018Saltsea\u2019. Explore strange and wonderful communities, uncover a deep conspiracy, choose where to go and which crew members to investigate with, and chart a journey through twists and turns, difficulties and delights. A Post-Flood World Visit different island communities as you investigate the mystery at the heart of the game. This flooded world, betrayed by the so-called 'Hoarders', barely remembers a time before the Flood. They rebuilt on the ruins of what came before, and new talents and technologies took the place of the old. Many surprises await! Choose Your Priorities In Saltsea Chronicles you guide the entire crew through the story. As well as investigating the mystery of your captain\u2019s disappearance, you will uncover secrets, create and resolve tensions between the crew, and add to your number as you meet others who ask to join you. Each chapter, you pick which island to visit and who to send on the expedition. Your choices will unlock different content, develop relationships, and give you a chance to resolve (and create) tensions within the crew. With a lightning-fast navigation system, you\u2019re free to hop around the islands as you explore. Choose between short and snappy observations, or dig deep into conversations, exploring the islands across different times of day. Uncover a Conspiracy Was your captain kidnapped? Or did she leave of her own free will? Keep track of the mystery in Murl\u2019s Log and collect records of your encounters as stickers in the Almanac. Different playthroughs will trace different pathways, with some dramatic consequences for your crew. You can replay from any chapter and branch your save file to meet new crew members, explore different communities and uncover a rich and gripping story. Themes From an award-winning and diverse writersroom \u2013 with experience in Young Adult fiction, film, theatre, poetry and games \u2013 Saltsea Chronicles imagines a rich world where communities have rebuilt in the aftermath of disaster, creating a new society of connection, resilience and hope\u2014but one still troubled by the universal questions of how to live together through conflict and change. This wide-reaching story game traces meaningful themes with humour, lightness of touch, and care.

While Kotora takes her studies seriously, Usada has her head in the clouds. She wanders over to a bookshed deep inside, returning with a big, thick book. \"I found this interesting-looking book!\" Kotora looks back at her quizzically. Suddenly, a slip of paper falls out from the book. The letter reads: \"Find Alice.\" As soon as they read the words, the two are enveloped in a blinding light. When they come to, they're in a grassy field that they've never seen before. At that moment, a white rabbit comes hopping along. He might know how to get back to their own world! The pair take their first steps into the world of this magical book, in order to go searching for the white rabbit... Alice Escaped! is an exploratory 2D action Metroidvania. Follow the adventures of Usada and Kotora, who have wandered into a strange wonderland of grimoires and must chase after a mysterious girl named Alice in order to return to their own world. What awaits them in this mysterious world are strange yet familiar characters, such as Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, and Humpty Dumpty. Are they friends or foes? And why does the white rabbit Usamura have a zipper on his back? And who exactly is this enigmatic girl hiding Alice in the deepest part of the world? This is where you've probably realized that this game has multiple endings. There are numerous major choices to be made, a story that repeats itself, and the true goals of the characters to be revealed. An adventure the likes of which you've never experienced before is about to begin! ■ Battle Action One of the core points of this game is its stylish, tag-team battle system! Swing Usada\u2019s giant hammer to pulverize your enemies with powerful melee attacks, or use Kotora\u2019s submachine gun and bombs to take out enemies from a distance. Switch between the two to chain impressive combos! Chaining combos will increase their attack power, and make it easier to quickly defeat your many oncoming enemies. Taking out enemies builds up your Chance Gauge, which can be used to perform supporting attacks and devastating ultimate attacks. (Feature not included in the demo.) The intensity builds in boss fights: whittle down their Shield Gauge to break their shields, letting you unleash a flurry of attacks. But beware: they've got a variety of powerful attacks to hit you back with! ■ Our heroines learn and grow When you collect the skill crystals that drop all over the world, you can improve your characters' skills. You can improve their weapons, which will then unlock unique skills. Or you can focus on their stats and movement, and even pick up skills to help them convince others to help them. If you find yourself stuck on a difficult boss, then try taking some time away from the main path to help our heroes grow stronger. Scattered about here and there in the world are death matches (areas where you can't proceed without defeating all of the enemies there), and if you can finish them with a high-count combo, or without taking any damage, you can earn skill crystal fragments. In addition, out in the world you can also find Heart Crystals, which increase your heroes' maximum health, in addition to other key items that they'll need on their adventure. Based on what you find, you might find that they're protected by powerful traps, just like the treasure you'd find deep inside of a cave. Go explore any way you wish in the world of Alice in Wonderland!","SaleStarted":"2024-08-20","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202308\/1820\/f41253f41480d5c0a2e1dafd651b1915afe01ac0126acd96.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP0734-CUSA43414_00-0922380785609695","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action","id":"EP0734-CUSA43414_00-0922380785609695","PlusPrice":489.3,"Title":"Alice Escaped!","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SEKAI PROJECT, INC","ReleaseDate":"2023-08-24","Slug":"alice-escaped!-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"559.20","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-09-04","LowestPrice":"","description":"King of the Hat is 2-4 player 2D party platformer where you fight with a hat!

A dreaded chieftain is assembling an army intent on taking over the kingdom. Villagers cry out for a hero, help them to rise up against the forces of this feared villain. Construct buildings to strengthen your village, train your army and equip your allies. Look for key-assistance in other villages, such as dwarves, amazons, and witches. With their help and the strengthening of your army, lead missions, defeat the invaders and make the region a safe place again. We are stronger together! Unlike regular Tower Defense games, Warstone TD has a unique method of summoning defenders (towers represented by player\u2019s allies and army). You start a mission with a fairly empty map and a few stones where you can place defenders. As the level progresses, more stones appear and some even drop from enemies, allowing you to place them in any valid position on the map. Powerful warstones also occasionally appear, which give significant bonuses to specific defenders when placed on them. You can summon any of the basic army classes on the stones. Each class has its own specialization path, damage type, gold cost, and special abilities. With such a variety of defenders and game classes there is a huge amount of tactics , increasing replayability even further! This is Warstone TD Gold Edition, a rare jewel of the game that will take you through the complete experience, including the Astral Voyage expansion with new battles and challenging enemies in even harder modes. So, what are you waiting for? Join the battle right now and feel all the adrenaline of Warstone TD in the most supreme version of all - the Gold Edition!","SaleStarted":"2024-08-20","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202307\/3113\/aec4feb4881a14e4602bfde214a8f8a50a9b52fbf0316204.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP7246-CUSA39633_00-0328611524051970","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Strategy","id":"EP7246-CUSA39633_00-0328611524051970","PlusPrice":279.6,"Title":"Warstone TD Gold Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"DX Gameworks LLC","ReleaseDate":"2023-08-16","Slug":"warstone-td-gold-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"279.60","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-09-04","LowestPrice":"","description":"Explore this sweet world of adventure!

In a desperate move to end all wars that have been rampaging the world for decades, the mages provoked The Cataclysm. Massive balls of pure magic obliterated nearly everything. A strange purple mist propagated everywhere, with hordes of bloodthirsty mutants coming at night. Our only hope is now to banish all magic from this accursed world by casting The Last Spell, requiring several days of uninterrupted incantation whilst a few strained Heroes try to protect those damned mages. The Last Spell is a tactical RPG with roguelite elements in which you have to defend a city against hordes of deadly enemies. During daytime, prepare your Heroes, carefully choose how to rebuild your Haven and position your defenses. Over the night, exterminate all the monsters coming at your walls with a large range of weapons and skills. Then heal, level up, and repeat until the Magic Seal is broken. FEATURES Turn-Based Tactical RPG: ● The whole RPG package: a flurry of stats, skills, perks, traits\u2026 and more. ● Tons of items: armors, weapons, trinkets and potions\u2026 with their own stats and skills, as well as optional random modifiers. Each weapon has its own skillset and playstyle! ● Build your own classes: upgrade your heroes with stat bonuses and perks, and equip whatever gear you wish. Want to make a glass cannon rogue\/mage fighting with a gun? Do it! ● Manage your squad of heroes: they\u2019re strong, but they are few and have access to limited resources.

Every Action Point counts towards another day of survival. ● Enemies have strengths and weaknesses that will challenge your wits. And because hard is not enough for us, be prepared for the terrifying Elites! ● Each map will end with epic fights against unique mind-bending bosses. Protect the Haven: ● Rebuild the city to help you in-between fights. Get healed, forge new magical weapons, get new heroes. Spend your resources wisely, commander! ● Build up your defenses: walls, traps, towers, catapults\u2026 every tiny bit of help is welcome. ● Protect the Magic Circle at all costs! If you lose it, humanity is doomed. ● 5 Havens to protect, each with their own setup and challenges requiring you to tailor your strategy to beat the Great Evil. Roguelite Elements: ● The game is meant to be hard. You will fail\u2026 A lot.

Here, it is said that the power that lies dormant within the local demon spirits can be drawn out by challenging them to trials, where ancient demons who were once defeated by Momotaro are summoned to battle. However, few have ever returned from Kisejima alive. ■Characters: Kuuta, a demon warrior, and his spirit partner, Kazemaru Kuuta, the protagonist, is the only survivor of the Demon King's army that faced Momotaro in battle.

Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades. While most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go. You are one of those people. In-depths Survival Mechanics: Keep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point. Combat and Crime System: How far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are. Winter is Coming: Spend the last few days of autumn wisely \u2013 gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again. Expansive Story: Unlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav. Homeless, But Not Hopeless: Maybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own. You Are Not Alone: Is surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter. Claim the Throne: For over a decade, no one has been able to bring the many factions of the homeless together. The throne of the Homeless King has been sitting empty for far too long. Who will earn enough respect and prove themselves worthy of uniting the homeless? Will you rise to the occasion?","SaleStarted":"2024-08-20","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202205\/1814\/dqyOj6BeMDetJ9RSM8OQOzhw.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP6075-CUSA29679_00-1040084594243406","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP6075-CUSA29679_00-1040084594243406","PlusPrice":437.5,"Title":"Hobo: Tough Life","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Perun Creative s.r.o.","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-22","Slug":"hobo-tough-life-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"875.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"481.25","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"86","SaleEnds":"2024-09-04","LowestPrice":"","description":"Moss™ is a single-player action-adventure puzzle game and new IP from Polyarc tailor-made for the VR platform.
