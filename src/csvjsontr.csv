"92","2025-02-12","From PlayStation Studios and Bluepoint Games comes a remake of the PlayStation classic, Demon's Souls. Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who've faced its trials and tribulations before can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance. In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant, channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One. With the summoning of The Old One, a colourless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them lost their minds — left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained. Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title ""Slayer of Demons"" and send The Old One back to its slumber.","2025-01-28","/game/82153","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1717/GemRaOZaCMhGxQ9dRhnQQyT5.png?w=200","23","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP9000-PPSA01341_00-DEMONSSOULS00000","50%","59","Action","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/demons-souls","Demon's Souls","TRD","Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe","2020-11-11","demons-souls-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","619.00","32","309.50","0","3",

Set in late 19th century Japan and London, each title features five murder-mystery episodes filled with all the drama, laughs, twists and “turnabouts” you’ve come to expect from the legally labyrinthine legacy of Ace Attorney. Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you! In the course of each case, you’ll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimony, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn’t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn’t shout “OBJECTION!” when you know you’ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution’s claims and prove your client’s innocence. The game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease!

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before. France, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. EXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other. ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL Use ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target. HIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION Use workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal. INVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP Invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation. TENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER Customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode. ENHANCED KILL CAM More realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.","2025-01-28","/game/101756","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2116/59jHCjMBRhuRhPUKUUy2gkNd.png?w=200","10","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4529-PPSA04444_00-SNIPERELITE50000","70%","40","Fighting, Action","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/sniper-elite-5","Sniper Elite 5","TRD","REBELLION DEVELOPMENTS LTD","2022-05-25","sniper-elite-5-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","20","629.70","1","",

"70","2025-02-12","The Last Remnant told the story of a world filled with mysterious, ancient artefacts known only as “Remnants.” Nobody knew who created the Remnants, or for what purpose, but they drew on the staggering power they possessed for use in their everyday lives. However, the excesses of that power began to form a rift between those who ruled and those who obeyed, plunging the world into a long age of war and chaos. Our story begins nearly a thousand years since those ancient conflicts ended, with the journey of Rush, a young man, determined to uncover the truth.

"69","2025-02-12","Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes. Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled—this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these—and more—to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience—a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0102-CUSA24163_00-MAKAIRE000000001","67%","0","Action","346.17","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection","Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection","TRD","CE EUROPE LIMITED","2021-05-31","ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","346.17","1","",

"68","2025-02-12","The once thriving Kingdom of Hermes has fallen to an age of calamity. Seen as the answer to all the kingdom’s ailments, alchemy became a widely used practice across the land, with denizens welcoming it into their homes, using it to enhance and heal as they saw fit. When the price of alchemy became too steep, attempts to halt its use were made, each as woefully unsuccessful as the last, with the catastrophic consequences felt across the realm. Within days, the kingdom fell to chaos, infected monsters prowling the blood-soaked streets, all hope of a cure lost. Corvus is the kingdom’s final hope, the fate of Hermes resting in his feathered hands. The truth is buried deep in the memories Corvus left scattered throughout the punishing world, and only by collecting these lost memories can the kingdom be saved, but each time he dives back in, trying to piece together the truth, all he finds is more secrets. Key Features Harness the plague: Seize plague weapons from gruesome bosses and formidable enemies, wielding them as deadly weapons. Giving enemies a taste of their own medicine will be the only way to survive the horrors that lurk in the shadows of the once thriving kingdom Embrace the Raven: Shift into your raven form during battle, throw feathers like daggers to interrupt your enemies’ attacks, and perform executions with the swiftness of a raptor.

"68","2025-02-12","A 3rd person, fixed-camera survival horror adventure. Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages. The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him – but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible. Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences. As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them – and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain. A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's atmosphere.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/1308/IcgCV6RNmA3I0BUG4vIhQJca.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3792-CUSA20539_00-SONGOFHORROR0001","60%","0","Adventure, Horror","559.6","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/song-of-horror","SONG OF HORROR","TRD","RAISER GAMES, S.L.","2021-05-27","song-of-horror-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1399.00","0","559.60","1","",

With readily accessible DUALSHOCKÂ®4 controls and an ergonomic design, swap weapons and lob grenades easily while remaining comfortable so you can survive and play longer.

In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming 8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he takes on hordes of zombies let loose upon the world. Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne. Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury. Protect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic's epic story. 1 player 600MB minimum save size DUALSHOCKÂ®4 Vibration Function Remote Play Supported HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Build the required units and you’ll be ready to face fire, infections, thieves, and more. The easy-to-understand UI will promptly tell you if something is wrong, so you will immediately be able to take action.

"","2025-02-12","Humanity has developed faster-than-light travel technology and is now ready to create a multi-planet civilization. You are the leader of the Quriocity 1 mission, which is directed on an alien planet very similar to Earth to create the very first alien colony. CLUSTERS, BUILDINGS AND UPGRADES Most of your units depend on a specific cluster-head building, which can serve as a storage or as a control hub. Keep this in mind when you add new structures, and put them in a smart way to optimize the available space. You can upgrade all your units to improve their efficiency, but only after upgrading the Principal Rover, which is the core of your colony. SECTORS AND REGIONS Explore the surrounding area to unlock new regions and expand your colony even more. Each region is divided into sectors, and each sector will provide different resources. Or maybe it will be a clean sector, useful to build schools, entertainment units and other structures required for the wellness of your colonists. A STEADY FLOW OF COLONISTS Everyone is eager to join your colony, so be ready to welcome a steady flow of new people. Your mission is to ensure that they have a long, happy and productive life, so be sure to provide all they need: apartments, food, education, jobs, and much more. Accept the challenge and you will be rewarded with an ever-growing colony with thousands of people. 5 UNIQUE MAPS Discover 5 beautiful maps, ranging from the arid desert to the freezing tundra. Each map is characterized by a unique environment and peculiar plants. DYNAMIC WEATHER AND DISASTERS The weather changes dynamically according to the map and to the season. But be careful, because dangerous disasters can take place on each map; if you don’t prepare to face them, they will deal massive damage to your colonies. CAMPAIGNS, SURVIVAL AND SANDBOX Play the way you want! - Test your skills and fulfill diverse objectives in more than 50 campaigns. - Build an ever-growing colony in the survival mode; you can choose a relaxing easy experience, an intermediate challenge, or a hard management undertaking. - Experiment with the game rules and build your dream colony in the sandbox mode. INCIDENTS HAPPEN Even the best strategy must bend to unpredictable events, but don’t worry; you have all the tools you need to face the adversities of this bare planet. Build the required units and you’ll be ready to face fire, infections, thieves, and more. The easy-to-understand UI will promptly tell you if something is wrong, so you will immediately be able to take action. RESEARCHES AND AUTOMATION Research the technologies that best suit your strategy, and find the best way to make your colony ever more efficient. As you progress, you will unlock more and more researches, and you’ll be able to automate a lot of tasks in order to focus on the most important ones, such as finding the perfect balance and expanding in new regions.

Deadlink is a guns-blazing cyberpunk FPS with roguelite elements. You're the first operative to be recruited to the experimental Deadlink project. Pilot an autonomous combat shell, fighting your way through cramped slums, twisted labs, grimy warehouses, and sleek office buildings on a mission to thwart the schemes of the most powerful corporations in the world. Wield a deadly arsenal, upgrade your skills and tech, devastate destructible environments, and slash corporate profit margins — all at the same time. You are the Corporate Security Agency’s greatest weapon, and it's your job to make sure the corporations and their shady deals are anything but secure. With the team at HQ backing you up, you're tossed headfirst into the fray, where a military operation with plausible deniability can fix things for a fraction of the cost of a hopeless court case. Every randomized run will be different, but one thing never changes: you will be outnumbered. Get ready to think on your feet as you dash, jump, and use the environment to your advantage. You can't still, not even for a second. Equip your shell with powerful weapon loadouts. Try out various combinations as you blaze a path of destruction. Want to snipe your foes from a distance, debilitate them with status effects, or just go in guns blazing? Whatever your playstyle, you can find the right kit for the job. Your enemies have no shortage of bullets and bodies to throw at you. But you're no slouch either. Sure, you might lose a combat shell here and there, but your next one will be even tougher. Start each new run with amped-up skills and deadlier firepower!","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202406/1811/00a3dc838510f9d462ddfde9d782b2bcda16623f8202ad5a.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2627-PPSA22668_00-DEADLINKPS5BUNDL","30%","0","Shooter, Action","473.85","null","null","Deadlink - OST Bundle","TRD","Crunching Koalas Sp. z o.o.

"","2025-02-12","You are a representative of the CRAFT & Co company. You are selling automated fabrication tools across the galaxy when your spacecraft crashes into a hostile planet where you'll have to build the strongest defenses if you wish to live to escape from it. But be warned... this planet is merciless. Use the tools you sell and the local resources to build up all of what you'll need to survive and eventually be able to escape the planet. Explore, fight, craft and build your defenses! Enjoy a unique and innovative game: - Strategy: survive massive attacks each night by building strong walls and placing turrets wisely. - Physics: build wisely or your structures will collapse! And you will need them to defend your base, or build bridges and high towers to access remote locations. - Water cycle: rain, infiltration, underground rivers and lakes... be careful during the heavy rains, or you could be surprised by a sudden water level rise! - Play classic or try the custom game modes: Under the Sea (start in a cave under a huge ocean!), Sky World (a random world composed of hundreds of flying islands), or Base Defense (no exploration, only base building and defense). - Activate the Hazardous Events option to trigger various surprises like Meteor Shower, Rain Flood, Earthquake, Volcano Eruption or even a Sharkstorm! - Enjoy Creative Mode and produce all items for free. This includes cheated items and tools to modify terrain or even create water and lava! Gameplay: - Fun from the start: no awfully slow digging, so you can concentrate on the exploration, fights and strategy. - Game's final objective: you must build a rocket ship to escape the planet. - Strategy survival: the game is a survival game in a strategic meaning. No hunger needs, the whole point of the game is to survive to the massive attacks each night. And to do that, you will have to explore the world to gather resources and craft your defenses. Fights: - No swords, magic or flying clown monsters here! It's a consistent science-fiction world, with fast and fun laser guns fights! - Intelligent monsters: they will find the best path to attack your defenses. And be careful: even if they can't move through walls, they can still destroy them! - Difficulty progression: only the species of monsters you have already killed before attack during the night (they probably took it badly). So you can progress at your own pace and choose when you are ready to move forward and fight stronger monsters. - AI companion: your crashed ship contains an AI that survived and will give you useful advices (or not!). Build him a drone so he can follow you and even help you fight the monsters! World Simulation: - Huge world with global real-time simulation of the environment, physics, water cycle and lighting. - Electricity: build solar panels or functional hydroelectric generators to power your base’s most advanced items! - Plants simulation: plants naturally grow and spread if their life-conditions are met. Create some farms with artificial sun lamps and irrigation. - Procedurally generated world: Major areas locations are specific to benefit from a logical game progression, but detailed layout of surface, caverns, ores, etc. are unique at each playthrough. Crafting and Building: - Crafting: You dig minerals, harvest plants and kill some monsters and bosses in order to craft better items and defenses. But the digging is really fast, your inventory space is infinite and all crafting recipes are displayed, so you don’t waste all your time on grinding or wikis and can concentrate on setting up better defenses. - Base construction: You build a fortress, not a holiday house.","2025-01-28","/game/27785","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2308/6e56d24f2550a77bee5a652a33655c45836d672e31c9d890.png?w=200","13","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0958-PPSA06478_00-DIGORDIEPS5EU000","76%","35","Adventure","83.76","null","null","Dig or Die","TRD","BLITWORKS SL","2024-06-05","dig-or-die-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","349.00","0","83.76","1","",

"","2025-02-12","Hand In Hand is a 2D split screen puzzle platformer, where the player can control two characters at once, or two players can play in co-op mode on one device. A TOUCHING STORY Two soulmates live in a fairytale world. But when evil came to their world, they lost each other. Now both of them need to head towards each other, facing many difficulties and dangers along the way. And only by finding a fragile connection between one another and going hand in hand will they be able to defeat evil and meet again. It's a story about how we can help one another even when you're apart, and be far from one another even when you're nearby. It's a story about the importance of relationships and mutual support. But every story has an even deeper meaning... SPLIT SCREEN The game works in splitscreen mode, with one character on each screen in their respective locations. The game has two modes. The first is single-player mode, where one player simultaneously controls both characters with one joystick. In this mode, the player must demonstrate sophisticated controller skills. The second is local co-op mode, where two players control the characters using two joysticks. Here, both players control their respective characters. Each mode has its advantages. Single-player mode requires you to show great dexterity and reaction speed, and co-op mode allows you to feel the joy of playing the game with your family or friend. Try both game modes, we hope you'll like it and enjoy completing it. THE CHARACTERS INTERACT WITH AND HELP EACH OTHER Each character has their own part of the level in a common location. However, some parts of the level are interconnected. This means that the characters can interact and help each other complete the level. Characters can move keys and objects from one part of the screen to another, and most puzzles are need to be solved by both characters working together, connecting parts of the screen and solving puzzles together. EPIC BOSSES The game has epic boss battles. Each boss represents the world of shadows that has invaded this fairytale forest and wants to plunge all the inhabitants of this fairytale world into the horror of eternal darkness. Our brave heroes, Lina and Minho, must defeat each of the bosses so that peace and prosperity will once again reign in the fairy forest. Boss battles take place without splitscreen, and are designed to be played by just one of the characters, so each character must defeat their evil shadow bosses. PUZZLES On their way through the collapsing fairy-tale world, the characters will constantly encounter various puzzles like closed doors, laser beams with reflectors, ancient mechanisms and ruins, labyrinths, and caves full of dangers. Our heroes will be able to overcome all difficulties, but each will have to make every effort to pass these trials and help their companion.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202401/0717/e7c4ffb6d2ae07086997a00fbfff54b8c9940ca34fed2d49.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6606-CUSA47121_00-0609938982487704","35%","0","Puzzle","230.45","null","null","Hand in Hand","TRD","Dmitrii Milovidov trading as OverGamez","2024-05-23","hand-in-hand-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","419.00","0","272.35","1","",

"","2025-02-12","Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. Airstrip DLC It is more story-driven than what we did in the past and it allows you to build a small airstrip close to your gas station. Meet Joe Joe is an old pilot flying an old single engine plane. He is a bit strange and one day approaches you to help him with his endeavours. For that he needs a place to land in the middle of nowhere to make a stop halfway to his destination. In return he is willing to cut you in on his deals. The Airstrip You have plenty of space and as it turned out, there used to be an old military landing strip during WWII close to your gas station. Should be that hard to make it work again, right? You might even go a step further, order some aviation fuel and some parts for planes. A windsock wouldn’t probably hurt and some lights might turn out to be useful, since you will on occasion also need to help him land. Let’s see how things develop and what Joe is up to... The Plane Joe’s plane is like its pilot: old. It’s also simple. The most advanced technology on this thing is the LED reading light Joe uses to find his way on the chart. How hard can it be to fix some simple things on a small plane? And it’s not like you are doing it for free. The Gameplay The Airstrip DLC brings new game mechanics and content to Gas Station Simulator based on events. Unlike the content we introduced in the past, it does not require your constant attention, it is more something that happens every now and then.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/0811/b8f13605c8c28858ee9edb0a090601b63229b7a90f139710.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-0529173475105583","30%","0","Simulation","545.35","null","null","Gas Station Simulator and Airstrip DLC Bundle","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2024-05-16","gas-station-simulator-and-airstrip-dlc-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","839.00","0","587.30","1","",

Make use of glimmers and combos in battle; meet a diverse cast of races, including monsters, mechs, and vampires; and experience your very own story, created through your choices and actions. Distant Worlds Woven Together: Travel to 17 unique worlds from the Junction, either led by the hand of destiny or by a path forged by your own choices. Discover the completely different cultures and landscapes, ranging from a densely developed forest of skyscrapers and a green and luscious habitat covered in plant life to a world governed by five witches, or one ruled by vampires - just to name a few of the distinct settings. An Eclectic Cast of Protagonists: Six leading characters, all from diverse backgrounds and with vastly different goals, set out on their journey in five unique story arcs. They venture to the myriad of worlds for their very own personal reasons: One, a human on a mission to protect the barrier defending his city; another, a witch trying to regain her lost magic while maintaining her disguise as a schoolgirl; and yet another, a vampire lord out to regain his crown and reclaim the throne as the rightful king of his world. Even selecting the same protagonist for a second--or third or fourth--playthrough will lead to completely new events and stories, a completely fresh path and experience. A Story of Your Very Own Making: SaGa Emerald Beyond has the greatest number of branching plots of any game in the SaGa series. The story branches abundantly depending on your choices and actions. Every time you visit a world, the story will evolve, allowing the protagonist and player alike to discover new possibilities. As the story unfolds in this way it becomes a tale all of your own, not only affecting the path you walk but also the multiple potential endings that await each protagonist. Battles where a Single Choice Can Change Everything: SaGa Emerald Beyond further refines the highly strategic Timeline Battles the SaGa franchise has been long renowned for. With series mainstays such as the skill to spontaneously acquire abilities through the Glimmer system, tactical ally placement known as Formations, and United Attacks that enable individual skills to connect together to form devastating chain attacks, it offers the best iteration of SaGa's turn-based combat to date. The new combat system adds more drama than ever before, allowing you to support party members, interrupt enemy actions, and use United Attacks by strategically manipulating the order of ally actions. The characters that join you, the weapons you wield, your party formation, and your tactics in battle - everything is up to you!","2025-01-28","/game/137793","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/1110/3e091ae115b4cad403eb9f591e3c59cc1488ac656c9a4e0d.png?w=200","13","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0082-PPSA16123_00-SAGAEMERALDBYDEU","40%","57","Role-Playing","1049.4","null","null","SaGa Emerald Beyond -","TRD","Square Enix LTD","2024-04-24","saga-emerald-beyond--ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","29","1049.40","1","",

By dint of sword, and by way of magical objects known as “rune-lenses,” the land’s history has been shaped by the alliances and aggressions of the humans, beastmen, elves, and desert people who live there. The Galdean Empire has edged out other nations and discovered a technology that amplifies the rune-lenses’ magic. Now, the Empire is scouring the continent for an artifact that will expand their power even further. It is on one such expedition that Seign Kesling, a young and gifted imperial officer, and Nowa, a boy from a remote village, meet each other and become friends. However, a twist of fate will soon drag them into the fires of war, and force them both to reexamine everything they believe to be right and true.

Would-be marijuana moguls will need to prioritize resources carefully as they manage the production and distribution of their weed. Cultivate killer plants, cross-breed them to create unique strains of the devil’s lettuce, hire and manage a growing staff, and be prepared to take on the competition. As in real life, the business of bud presents plenty of opportunity along with a plethora of problems.

"","2025-02-12","Kingdoms and Castles is a city-building simulation game about growing a kingdom from a tiny hamlet to a sprawling city and imposing castle. Your kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner. Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen. And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter. A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests. Forge your kingdom's destiny in Kingdoms and Castles, a captivating city-building adventure where your choices define your realm's prosperity and survival.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/0611/8428ac1bdf23df8111a843081c571ee57ecaf0ab3281f7b2.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0958-PPSA16909_00-KINGDOMSANDPS5EU","20%","0","Strategy, Simulator","420","null","null","Kingdoms and Castles","TRD","BLITWORKS SL","2024-03-21","kingdoms-and-castles-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","420.00","1","",

You play as Airhead, a small Body and the round inflated organism it uses as a Head. And while Head is slowly but surely deflating, you have a chance to save its life. To do so, you must use air tanks to keep Head inflated while you explore Airhead’s metroidvania-style world, searching for amazing abilities and upgrades that will unlock new areas and puzzles for you to overcome. On your adventure, it will be up to you to uncover the true connection between Head, the air tanks, and the technology that litters the world, so you can save Head no matter the cost. EXPLORATION Finding your way through Airheads world is not always easy. You must brave dark caverns, ancient structures, and other mysterious locations in order to save Head.

PUZZLES As you explore, you will come across numerous puzzles that use the environment, strange creatures, and old technology to challenge your logic and creativity.

An unassuming Body, with an instinct to help others, witnesses the tragedy. With no thoughts to the consequences, it takes its new head’s fate on its shoulders, becoming Airhead. Now, Airhead must rely on air tanks to keep the Head inflated, while it searches far and wide for the machine that stole Head’s air source. But that machine is only a small part of a larger whole, and Head may hold a greater place in the grand scheme than Body could have ever imagined.

The great grandpappy of adventure games will test you and tickle your problem-solving skills as you unearth its plot and secrets. Through cunning trial-and-error you will crawl through tight squeezes, encounter impressive caverns, collect inventory, locate treasure, thwart dwarf attacks, all while keeping your eye on the score before your lamp goes out. Dust off your vintage Colossal Cave maps from the 70s, they'll still work like a charm. This is a faithful tribute to the original game design. Developed in the mid-1970’s by amateur cave spelunker, this classic text-adventure was originally crafted as a way for a father to entertain his two young daughters. Will Crowther based his design on detailed cave maps he’d made with his wife, Patricia, of the Bedquilt section of Kentucky’s Mammoth cave. Family cave exploration is at the heart of this game. Shortly thereafter, the code-prankster, Don Woods, discovered the game on the ARPANET and expanded the cave. He layered in more fun, fantasy, puzzles, and a vexing 350-point system. Years later, Don’s expansion became the most accessible and the definitive version of Colossal Cave Adventure. Enter Roberta Williams. She first played the game in 1979 and was instantly hooked. She spent weeks playing, taking notes and mapping out the cave, as it was revealed through the textual descriptions in game. Her mind filled with imaginary neon mushrooms, misty underground lakes, a snappy bivalve mollusk, and a noticeably absent giant. After achieving all 350 points, she was ready for another adventure – a dilemma in 1979. If it was another adventure she wanted, she’d have to make her own... In 1980 she designed and developed the world’s first graphic computer game, Mystery House. This groundbreaking game is considered one of the most influential in history, establishing conventions that have become standard in the adventure genre. It has been ported to just about every computer and console, played by millions, and inspired many other games, books, movies, and TV series. Relive the golden age of adventure gaming. Immerse yourself in a timeless, sprawling cave system filled with treasures, creatures, and brain-teasing puzzles. Transport back to a more innocent time. Experience the retro-cool of yesteryear's gaming mechanics, accompanied by an art style that harkens back to the golden age of adventure games. This lovingly assembled tribute is brought to you by boutique studio, Cygnus Entertainment. Ken and Roberta Williams are committed to sharing and preserving the spirit of classic adventure games. With its challenging and mind-bending puzzles, this explorative game will keep you enthralled. Explore 14 distinct regions filled with magic, hidden secrets, breathtaking views, and cave-dwelling creatures. Each area offers a unique and enchanting experience.

This expansion unfolds parallel to the main game, putting you in the shoes of FBC agent Kiran Estevez, portrayed by Janina Gavankar.

His character must track down the Master of the Many Worlds and prevent him from murdering the multiversal hero’s different selves across parallel universes.  - North Star : The Sibling, an unknown woman who bears a striking resemblance to FBC Director Jesse Faden, is trying to find her missing brother, who is being held captive at Coffee World. - Number One Fan : The Waitress, who bears a striking resemblance to Oh Deer Diner’s waitress Rose Marigold, must save her idol, the Writer, from the danger he finds himself in. To do so, she must confront the Writer’s critics, and the Bad Boy who is the Writer’s evil twin. Digital base game A string of ritualistic murders threatens Bright Falls, a small-town community surrounded by Pacific Northwest wilderness. Saga Anderson, an accomplished FBI agent with a reputation for solving impossible cases arrives to investigate the murders. Anderson’s case spirals into a nightmare when she discovers pages of a horror story that starts to come true around her. Alan Wake, a lost writer trapped in a nightmare beyond our world, writes a dark story in an attempt to shape the reality around him and escape his prison. With a dark horror hunting him, Wake is trying to retain his sanity and beat the devil at his own game.

ENDLESSâ„¢ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESSâ„¢ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her ""unusual"" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESSâ„¢ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations.

Welcome to Everhood, a bizarre realm located on the edges of space and time. Its inhabitants are a peculiar lot. These otherworldly entities spend their days wandering labyrinthine castles. Clubbing and board games are popular pastimes here, as well. That is, until a gnome steals an arm from Red, the wooden doll. A seemingly simple quest to reclaim it begins to pull at the fraying threads of this strange world, unraveling a mystery and reality in the process. Go on a trip through the doors of perception. Explore fantastical environments in the hunt for the pinched limb. Play hide and seek with animate mushrooms in the forest, win carnival prizes, and race go-karts against colorful characters like mages, sentient save points, robots, and vampires. Learn about Red's past and come ever-closer to finding the Absolute Truths of the Universe. But knowledge often comes at a cost. Some of Everhood's eclectic residents aren't content to let Red roam the realm freely. Face off against challengers ranging from multi-legged monsters to brothers who run a plank-selling business, and the fearsome Gold Pig, in musical battles. Avoid incoming attacks by moving, grooving, and leaping out of harm's way while jamming out to bespoke battle themes as varied as the inhabitants of this curious community.

Now you can embrace the legendary cruelty and humor of the iconic cartoon as you play your favorite characters in The Crackpet Show: Happy Tree Friends Edition! Get ready to unleash chaos, earn fame, and have a blast! Are you ready to get famous? If so, grab your gun and join the most violent TV show in the history of violent TV shows! Participants will have to shoot, smash and rip through hundreds of enemies on their way to victory! Don’t be discouraged by THE GIANT BOSSES that are more than capable of turning your innards outwards – just grab the best perks and weapons along the way. Make your gun spew molten lava all over the floor, turn yourself into a berserker, and let your bullets bounce between enemies! All these things stack, so you have every opportunity to turn your furry warrior into a raging death machine. You’ll still die, though. That’s just how life is, even for those who wield a rail gun. But who cares about death when your audience loves YOU? Unlike real life, here you can make good use of the likes you receive. Use your new-found fame to help upgrade every item and every perk to deal even more damage when you head out again. Oh, don’t worry about getting bored: every episode of the show is randomized so you’ll never have the same run twice in-a-row. And, when you are completely done with show business, invite your friends and party-up with co-op mode with up to four players! Play smart and synergize with the team or bash their teeth in when they will try to steal your power-ups: every dirty trick in the book is valid, and every strategy works as long as you are having fun. So, are you ready to sign the contract?

Activities range from fishing and taking photos, to a memory card game, resort tycoon, and an entire infrastructure of drone races and upgrades.

"","2025-02-12","One summer's day, Usada and Kotora go to the library to do their homework. While Kotora takes her studies seriously, Usada has her head in the clouds. She wanders over to a bookshed deep inside, returning with a big, thick book. ""I found this interesting-looking book!"" Kotora looks back at her quizzically. Suddenly, a slip of paper falls out from the book. The letter reads: ""Find Alice."" As soon as they read the words, the two are enveloped in a blinding light. When they come to, they're in a grassy field that they've never seen before. At that moment, a white rabbit comes hopping along. He might know how to get back to their own world! The pair take their first steps into the world of this magical book, in order to go searching for the white rabbit... Alice Escaped! is an exploratory 2D action Metroidvania. Follow the adventures of Usada and Kotora, who have wandered into a strange wonderland of grimoires and must chase after a mysterious girl named Alice in order to return to their own world. What awaits them in this mysterious world are strange yet familiar characters, such as Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, and Humpty Dumpty. Are they friends or foes? And why does the white rabbit Usamura have a zipper on his back? And who exactly is this enigmatic girl hiding Alice in the deepest part of the world? This is where you've probably realized that this game has multiple endings. There are numerous major choices to be made, a story that repeats itself, and the true goals of the characters to be revealed. An adventure the likes of which you've never experienced before is about to begin! â–  Battle Action One of the core points of this game is its stylish, tag-team battle system! Swing Usada’s giant hammer to pulverize your enemies with powerful melee attacks, or use Kotora’s submachine gun and bombs to take out enemies from a distance. Switch between the two to chain impressive combos! Chaining combos will increase their attack power, and make it easier to quickly defeat your many oncoming enemies. Taking out enemies builds up your Chance Gauge, which can be used to perform supporting attacks and devastating ultimate attacks. (Feature not included in the demo.) The intensity builds in boss fights: whittle down their Shield Gauge to break their shields, letting you unleash a flurry of attacks. But beware: they've got a variety of powerful attacks to hit you back with! â–  Our heroines learn and grow When you collect the skill crystals that drop all over the world, you can improve your characters' skills. You can improve their weapons, which will then unlock unique skills. Or you can focus on their stats and movement, and even pick up skills to help them convince others to help them. If you find yourself stuck on a difficult boss, then try taking some time away from the main path to help our heroes grow stronger. Scattered about here and there in the world are death matches (areas where you can't proceed without defeating all of the enemies there), and if you can finish them with a high-count combo, or without taking any damage, you can earn skill crystal fragments. In addition, out in the world you can also find Heart Crystals, which increase your heroes' maximum health, in addition to other key items that they'll need on their adventure. Based on what you find, you might find that they're protected by powerful traps, just like the treasure you'd find deep inside of a cave. Go explore any way you wish in the world of Alice in Wonderland!","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/1820/f41253f41480d5c0a2e1dafd651b1915afe01ac0126acd96.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0734-CUSA43414_00-0922380785609695","30%","0","Action","419.4","null","null","Alice Escaped!","TRD","SEKAI PROJECT, INC","2023-08-24","alice-escaped!-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","489.30","1","",

Exoprimal is an online, team-based action game that pits humanity's cutting-edge exosuit technology against history's most ferocious beasts – dinosaurs. Exosuits are grouped into different roles, and players will pilot these exosuits to hold firm against overwhelming dinosaur swarms in online-only, team-based action game modes. Dino Survival, the main game mode, sees two teams of five players compete in a variety of PvE and PvP missions. Players will be transported to the scene of the latest dinosaur outbreak and follow Leviathan's guidance to complete objectives. The team that completes the mission first will emerge victorious. Whether players are engaging the other team directly, or fighting alongside them against a common enemy, the aim is to accomplish objectives as quickly as possible. Missions vary depending on player skill and other factors, meaning no two matches will unfold the same way.

"","2025-02-12","BEGIN WITH PASSION FOR MOONSHINE We love moonshin’. There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner.

"","2025-02-12","Story: Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine takes place right after the events of Super Meat Boy Forever. After meticulously analyzing Meat Boy all throughout Super Meat Boy Forever (did you notice the cameras in the levels???), the nefarious Dr. Fetus now has all the data he needs to create the perfect Meat Boy clone! There’s just one problem: The DNA sample he’s collected isn’t a perfect specimen, which in turn yields some…less than perfect clones… But fear not, Dr. Fetus knows how to solve this problem. He creates a bunch of ruthless test chambers and starts sending all of the clones he’s created through them, in order to weed out the crap clones from the good ones. The specimens start out looking nothing like Meat Boy, but over time that grotesquely lovable face that Dr. Fetus hates so much, starts to emerge. Perfect clones are just on the horizon and after they’re done…who knows what happens next? Probably something to do joyously with torturing and killing lots of Meat Boys for the hell of it! About The Game: Dr. Fetus` Mean Meat Machine provides the perfect combination of classic puzzle-gameplay and hardcore platforming elements that Super Meat Boy is known for. Puzzle your way through beautiful hand-crafted worlds and more than 100 puzzle-levels, filled with creative traps and hazards. At the end of each world, prepare for a gruesome boss fight that will provide the ultimate challenge. Puzzle your way through familiar Super Meat Boy and Super Meat Boy Forever locations like the picturesque forest, the hospital, and salt factory in a fresh classic puzzle game-inspired format. However, in Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine, matching at least 4 clones of the same kind and creating awesome combos isn't enough – you'll also have to avoid lethal hazards and traps, such as sawblades, rockets and pendulums. It’s a demented and hardcore spin on the classic puzzle formula you know and love! Enjoy dazzling backgrounds and animations from the original Super Meat Boy & Super Meat Boy Forever artists and listen to the wonderful soundtrack by RIDICULON, with unique remixed Super Meat Boy Forever tracks and new tunes. Features: â—� Over 100 hand-crafted levels filled with unique and deadly traps â—� Outrageous boss fights that up the ante with additional mechanics â—� One-of-a-kind combination of puzzle and action gameplay â—� Help Dr. Fetus create the perfect Super Meat Boy clone â—� Revisit worlds from Super Meat Boy and Super Meat Boy Forever â—� Original Soundtrack created by RIDICULON, with unique Remixes from Super Meat Boy Forever tracks and new scores â—� Developed in cooperation with Team Meat and the original Super Meat Boy artists","2025-01-28","/game/127941","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0313/e5d1d67367f770af7e16d8db5b2f4652f85f2ba4a63d0473.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5360-PPSA14003_00-FETUSMEATPS5SIEE","80%","0","Puzzle","69.8","null","null","Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine","TRD","HEADUP GAMES GMBH CO.

Based on the rider selected, playing and controlling your rider is now different. It's easier to reach maximum speed and to take certain trajectories tightly with a rider like Wout van Aert than with PrimoÅ¾ RogliÄ�. But be careful, because the lower the Downhill and Agility ratings of your cyclist, the more control you need! STAND OUT FROM OTHER RIDERS To add more immersion to the core of Tour de France 2023, we added two new bibs this year. You can now see and wear the """"super combative"""" bib and the best team bib. Prove you deserve to wear these distinctions by showing your panache! As in real life, riders can form a """"grupetto"""" to make a breakaway or if they have fallen behind. This helps to limit damage during difficult stages and conserve energy for future stages or the end of the race. SMOOTHER RACES In Tour de France 2023, trajectories and collisions have been redesigned so you can navigate within the peloton more easily. Thanks to these improvements, you can reposition yourself more easily and prepare for the end of the race as ideally as possible. All ratings have been updated based on the results of the riders' last season so that they reflect reality and the latest performances of professional cyclists. The Race of the Moment mode has also been updated with new challenges, races and optimisations that add more variety.

"","2025-02-12","The Gods have abandoned Midgard. Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","80%","0","Action, Adventure, Music/Rhythm","105","null","null","ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree","TRD","Untold Tales S.A.","2023-02-09","atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","0","105.00","1","",

"","2025-02-12","In this narrative-driven, third-person survival horror game set 300 years in the future, the player will take on the role of Jacob Lee – a victim of fate thrown into Black Iron Prison, a maximum-security penitentiary located on Jupiter's moon, Callisto. When inmates begin to transform into monstrous creatures, the prison is thrown into chaos. To survive, Jacob must battle his way to safety to escape Black Iron Prison, while uncovering the dark and disturbing secrets buried beneath the surface of Callisto. Using a unique blend of shooting and close-quarters combat, Jacob will need to adapt his tactics to combat the rapidly evolving creatures while scavenging to unlock new weapons, gear, and abilities to outrun the growing threat and escape the horrors of Jupiter's Dead Moon. HORROR ENGINEERING The Callisto Protocol is a next-generation take on survival horror from the mind of Glen Schofield. Blending atmosphere, tension, and brutality with terrifying moments of helplessness and humanity, The Callisto Protocol immerses players in a pulse-pounding story where unspeakable horrors lurk around every corner. UNCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE UNITED JUPITER COMPANY Set on Jupiter’s dead moon Callisto in the year 2320, The Callisto Protocol casts players as Jacob Lee, an inmate in Black Iron Prison. When a mysterious outbreak throws the moon into chaos, Jacob must face his darkest fears to defeat the bloodthirsty creatures that stalk him as he unravels the dark mysteries at the heart of the powerful United Jupiter Company. MASTER BRUTAL, STRATEGIC COMBAT The Callisto Protocol challenges players to master a thrilling blend of hand-to-hand and ranged combat, including a unique gravity weapon once used by Black Iron guards to control the prison population. Players will be forced to get up close and personal with their grotesque opponents, hacking off limbs, blasting off legs, and getting creative with whatever is at their disposal to survive each life-or-death encounter. EXPERIENCE THE ISOLATION OF JUPITER'S DEAD MOON One of the most hostile, isolated environments in the universe, Callisto looms large over Jacob’s desperate struggle to survive. Players must not only contend with the horrors of Black Iron Prison, but also the centuries-old secrets that plague Jupiter’s long-dead moon, both above and below the surface.","2025-01-28","/game/85967","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202206/0222/pqZVlL42HwbUMdSAyNQoRnzg.png?w=200","10","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5262-PPSA03352_00-9436657797426872","80%","15","Horror","999999","null","null","The Callisto Protocolâ„¢","TRD","KRAFTON, Inc.","2022-12-02","the-callisto-protocol-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2499.00","11","499.80","1","",

"","2025-02-12","Build railroads in order to connect cities, tunnels and bridges. New railways are cheap when laid across bare fields, but can be expensive when demolishing forests, villages and other existing structures. Manage increasing traffic by constructing, switches, sidings and spurs so that multiple trains can run without delays, at the same time. Stay accident-free by precisely controlling trains during crucial moments, using pause for planning (you can build railways and schedule trains while on pause). Play through 5 seasons: Europe (1830–1980), America (1840–1960), USSR (1880–1980), Japan (1900–2020) and Germany (1830-2020). Complete the story mode featuring such real-life events as the Gold Rush of 1849, the construction of the Florida Overseas Railroad, World War II, the Cold War, the launch of the first manned space flight Vostok 1, the fall of the Berlin Wall and more. Explore the game in different game modes: in story mode (5-10 minutes), in random mode (15-20 minutes – the level looks and develops differently every time you launch) or in sandbox-like regime (can be turned on for both story and random modes. It allows to play without time and money limits).

The goal is simple - enter the maze and gun down anything that stands between you and the exit. Your objective may always be the same but everything else is endlessly changing. Each maze is a procedurally generated level where the enemies, items, and the maze’s layout itself is random. Not a single corner you turn will be the same as the last time you entered. Progressively tougher alien foes will try to take you out once you enter their proximity so you better be ready to shoot first and ask questions later. Modifiers scattered around each maze will augment your abilities and shots. Each pick-up presents a unique choice that’ll define your play style. Simplicity is at the heart of Maze Blaze. It’s easy to jump into yet has enough depth to keep you playing. You can kick back in a long gaming session or just clear a couple of mazes when you’ve got a bit of downtime. No matter how you choose to play, you’ll always make progress. The more mazes you blast through, the more stuff you unlock. Mix and match your newly acquired powers and weapons to dive even further into the different game modes.

"","2025-02-12","Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom is a history-driven turn-based strategy set in World War 2. You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies. Possible alternate history flow - what would have happened if the Allies followed the ideas of Operation Unthinkable and went to war against the USSR in 1946? Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Advanced army manager - choose the composition of your forces. Acquire new units, upgrade or dismiss the outdated ones. Make sure that your forces have all the necessary tools for the upcoming battle. Real WW2 heroes - assign historical personalities to your armies and get access to special skills. Realistic 3D graphics - study the battle map and take advantage of 3D graphics, featuring volumetric terrain and physically-simulated movement of units. Attention to detail - game created by a team passionate about WW2 history.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0910/r28qdLdXatQ9aY1ux0GGRoQl.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA34476_00-8237173962609670","50%","0","Strategy","472.05","null","null","Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom","TRD","Klabater","2022-09-22","strategic-mind-fight-for-freedom-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","524.50","1","",

Each choice you make in the crucial few moments we all know may change our lives for good in a split of a second, influence what kind of person Mitch turns out to be and what values shall guide him once he becomes his own man.

Multiple awards and praise from critics have proved that Little Nightmares is definitely a must-play title. Little Nightmares I - “The Pioneer” In Little Nightmares, help Six escape The Maw, a vast, mysterious vessel inhabited by corrupted souls looking for their next meal! Go beyond Six story and dive deeper into The Maw with the additional story included in the “Secrets of the Maw” downloadable content. Little Nightmares II - “The Perfect Sequel” The distant humming transition of Little Nightmares II is calling. Together with Six, help Mono discover the dark secrets of The Signal Tower and avoid the terrible Residents of this world. KEY FEATURES EMBARK ON AN AWARD-WINNING ADVENTURE Enjoy an unsettling adventure that you will never forget. Outsmart the Residents, explore twisted areas and try to escape the nightmare. From the Maw to the Pale City, stay on lookout for the wicked souls who hunt you while you try to make sense of this world. REKINDLE YOUR CHILDHOOD WIT Reconnect with your inner child and stay out of harm’s way. Each room is a cell, each Resident a threat, and both are puzzles to untangle. Hide and sneak from danger and climb for safety to escape the chasing monsters or grasp your courage and nearby tools to fend off your tormenters. A UNIQUE AESTHETIC TARSIERS Studios have created an immersive world of great subtlety and outstanding sound design. Navigate through detailed landscapes, disturbingly familiar places, and beautifully rendered scenery. The soundtrack ranges from quiet ambient pieces during the exploration sequences to industrial, chaotic and nightmarish compositions during intense chases. The result is surreal and ethereal while remaining familiar – like the visual universe of Little Nightmares.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/3115/zyAN9ya8ZrVrQtU6VeIsssa7.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0700-PPSA02154_00-LN1LN2BUNDLE0000","70%","0","Action, Puzzle, Adventure","524.7","null","null","Little Nightmares I & II Bundle","TRD","BANDAI NAMCO ENTERTAINMENT EUROPE","2022-04-27","little-nightmares-i-ii-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","0","524.70","1","",

"","2025-02-12","In space, no one can hear you scream - neither a victorious cry, nor one loaded with frustration. So what shall it be, Space Pioneer, when you are the Captain of it all? BUILD A WONDROUS VIEW Build, install and redesign your station to perfection in a full 3D view taking advantage of the spectacular visuals provided by Unreal Engine 4. Look at your creation in a 360 degrees view, zooming in and out to marvel at its beauty. Look at the magnificent in-game star constellations, nebulas and planets the development team spent weeks researching to realistically provide in-game visualisations within the endless game sky. FOCUS ON THE ABSTRACT Monitor and set up production cycles, resources and their distribution. Focus either on efficiency or yield, treating everything as a diligent spreadsheet master - but with an abstract layout system resembling a circuit board to help you design the best connections, nooks and crannies to make your station a resounding engineering success! ECONOMICS, ERRORS AND MORE! A unique economic system provides you with a key objective - make your station efficient and profitable or fail! The normal route of business can be, however, disrupted by a number of disruptions: from hacker attacks to error and malfunctions each module and its system entail in your management of the station. Your production may also simply overload, given the production strain - so plan, execute and design to perfection! EXPLORE UNKNOWN PLANETS There are 3 distinct campaign missions where you need to terraform a given planet, make it habitable and easy to extract resources from. Built with a background narrative, each of these missions enable you to focus on the two game modes in order to build your station in such a way as to successfully fulfill their objectives. Are you going to be the most efficient, the most industrious or have the most graphically appealing modules set-up? Anything goes as long as the mission is successful! ENDLESS DREAMS You can also kick back and focus on building the greatest and either best looking or most efficient station there ever was - within either our Creative or Endless modes built especially for this purpose. orbit.industries blends inspiration from classic science fiction literature, movies, and popular space-opera TV series with actual knowledge and progress achieved in the field of space exploration, space engineering, and orbital stations development.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/0909/FcILE6TDqRKX9oWlXKd9X6M4.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA05565_00-1642117917262637","70%","0","Simulation","174.75","null","null","orbit.industries","TRD","Klabater","2022-04-21","orbitindustries-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","209.70","1","",

Each time you venture into the anomaly, it’ll change and become increasingly difficult as you grow in power.

"","2025-02-12","Get the full Dying Light 2 Stay Human experience with Reloaded Edition and the free ‘Bloody Ties’ DLC. Please note: DLC must be downloaded separately. It’s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE INFECTED Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/1512/35ead9b7fd1de13c76c33914969c350dc4149e5b7bb0e5d9.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2GAME0000000EU","67%","0","Unique","0","null","null","Dying Light 2 Stay Human","TRD","TECHLAND SP.

A dreamlike journey into a surreal world of the artist’s own creations where the atmospheric gameplay provides mysteries to discover, puzzles to solve and artistic landscapes to explore. GAMEPLAY You find yourself on an evolving island. As you investigate your surroundings, the island will start to change. The appearance of a ship, the rise of a lighthouse, each mystery you uncover and puzzle you solve will unfold new wonders and unveil new places to explore. But be forewarned, the scene you find yourself in, this breathtaking land of paint and oil is not always as straightforward as it appears. This intriguing world within the canvas holds more mysteries than even the artist intended. STORY Prague July 20th 1945 The city of Prague was under siege, ravaged by war. Buildings were falling, churches were burning, and everything was to be washed away forever. A painter lived there, isolated from the outside world. The worse the terrors of war became, the more the artist obsessively painted beautiful landscapes as a contrast to the evil he had witnessed. One night, a mysterious figure appeared in the house seemingly out of nowhere. The stranger walked slowly around the room, inspecting the paintings. He then sat down in front of the artist; to offer him a deal. The chance to enter one of his own creations, far away and free of war. But he would have to find his way back out before midnight, or else his soul would become trapped in the canvas forever. Feeling alone, on the edge of madness, terrorized by the scent of death creeping in from the streets, the artist shook the mysterious man's hand, accepting the deal.

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity’s last line of defense. Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF.

"","2025-02-12","Before he was the world’s greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naivetÃ© of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCOFROGWARESUAK","85%","0","Adventure, Action","236.25","null","null","Sherlock Holmes Chapter One","TRD","FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","2021-11-15","sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1575.00","0","236.25","1","",

DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. Deluxe Edition Content: • Unique Weapon: Transtar Trencher (PS5 Exclusive) • Unique Weapon: Eat The Rich Tribunal • Unique Weapon: .44 Karat Fourpounder • Character Skin: ""Party Crasher"" Colt • Character Skin: ""Sharp Shooter"" Julianna • Two Trinkets (equippable buffs) • Original Game Soundtrack Selections (*FORMATTED USB STORAGE DEVICE REQUIRED TO ACCESS AND PLAY SOUNDTRACK) DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane’s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","2025-01-28","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0511/Mf4pgYWJtQWLwUG66xNIWNJG.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DE1CDXDLOOPDELUX","80%","0","Action","127.8","null","null","DEATHLOOP Deluxe Edition","TRD","Bethesda","2021-09-13","deathloop-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","639.00","0","127.80","1","",

Fight countless enemies with a huge selection of gun turrets (in the form of comic heroes) and additional helpers (mines, air support, block wall) on more than 60 maps. Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

Each hole in the wasteland offers its own little story and possible puzzle to sink the perfect shot. Play through destroyed brutalist monuments, crumbling shopping malls, and abandoned museums as neon signs and poignant graffiti take swings at current events, Silicon Valley culture and humanity. Three Stories Make a (W)hole Piece together the full story of how humanity fell through three distinct sources - Details from the lone golfer’s story, who's come back to Earth for one last game. The Radio Nostalgia from Mars broadcast gives a glimpse into the lives of those who escaped, and the narration of a “secret spectator” watching from a distance. The 1% Killed the Radio Star Be accompanied by a purposefully composed soundtrack as well as personal stories broadcasted on Radio Nostalgia From Mars. The station caters to citizens of Mars, nostalgic for Earth as they listen to music from the 2020s, and dial in to share their memories of the planet. A smooth voiced radio DJ keeps the show flowing with updates and announcements hinting to a not so glamorous life on Mars. Fits Like a Glove Three distinct modes mean every golfer can find something for their tastes. Casual players can focus just on the story and a relaxing scenic round of golf in Story Mode. Those looking for an extra challenge can beat each hole under par using skill and puzzle solving through Challenge Mode.

"","2025-02-12","Order of Battle: World War II is a turn-based strategy game with an impressive variety of scenarios and theatres of war. Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders – split between Generals, Pilots and Captains – is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow.

Tribes of Midgard Deluxe Edition includes the base game, two in-game pets, and a set of PlayStation Exclusive Solar Valkyrie Cosmetic items. Tribes of Midgard is a co-op game with a unique blend of action, survival, and roguelite elements. Players must defend their village from hordes of invaders—deadly spirits and gigantic brutes—that every night threaten to destroy the Seed of Yggdrasil, the sacred tree you’re sworn to protect. Only by protecting the Seed, you and your tribe can stop RagnarÃ¶k—the end of the world! Venture with your tribe into the untamed wilds of Midgard to gather precious resources, hunt mythical beasts, defeat mighty foes, topple giants, and claim treasures. The further from the village you explore, the greater the challenge and greater the rewards—which you’ll need to stand against the ever-strengthening minions of the apocalypse. But you must return before the sun sets so you can bolster your defenses, craft powerful equipment, and fend off the nightly assaults. Â·Roguelite Meets Survival Action: Each gameplay session begins with your tribe being dropped into a fresh, procedurally generated world, equipped with nothing but the loincloth on their backsides and an eternal oath to save the world. Gain knowledge, meta experience, and account unlocks each session to aid you in your quest to hold off RagnarÃ¶k for as longas you can. The longer you and your tribe survive, the greater the rewards! Â·Face Colossal Game-Changers: Protect the Seed of Yggdrasil from a nightly invasion of Helthings and work together with your tribe to withstand the ever-looming threat of the JÃ¶tnar—epic giants hellbent on smashing both the Seed and your surrounding village to bits. The world (and the game) ends when the Seed is destroyed. Â·Forge Your Viking Legend: Level up your character each session by choosing a class and taking the battle into the wilds as you seek resources tocraft epic armor and mighty weaponry. Discover and equip powerful runes tocomplement your playstyle in surprising ways. Then, unleash destruction andprepare clever village defenses to give your enemies some nasty surprises. Â·Rally the Tribe: When the giants arrive, it takes a village to bring them down! Adventure through Midgard solo or form a tribe of up to 10 players in online PvE co-op. Test your Viking skills against the seasonal challenges of Saga Mode or tailor the experience to your liking and see how long you can “surthrive” in the highly customizable Survival mode. We recommend taking on RagnarÃ¶k with a tribe of four or more. Â·Explore a Bright Norse Realm: Gather resources, slay legendary beasts, delve through caves, claim treasure, and build anywhere as you explore formidable, procedurally generated lands on your quest to take on RagnarÃ¶k. Â·Keep Up the Fight: Free, limited time seasonal events will bring bigger challenges and even mightier treasures to the endgame of Midgard throughout the year, including new ways to play and new rewards to earn through the season’s unlockable progression track.

Your team starts at the bottom, but you may be invited to take part in the major races if the organisers see that your results are good enough. You can create and gradually level up your own rider in Pro Leader mode as you strive to become the next cycling legend to compete with the likes of Primoz Roglic, Tedej Pogacar and others. You can choose from four different profiles: climber, sprinter, puncher and versatile. Your choice will be crucial if your aim is to win a Grand Tour or be a specialist in the Classics! Create your own Tour My Tour mode has been redesigned to offer you more freedom. With the new interface it is now easier to customise your ""My Tour"" (rest days, stages, teams). You can now choose the list of participating teams and national teams. Choose from 89 stages to create your race. Enjoy a wide range of content The game includes the 19 World Tour teams and their jerseys as well as the teams Alpecin-Fenix, B&B Hotels P/B KTM, Team ArkÃ©a - Samsic and Total Direct Energie. There are also many official races (Paris-Roubaix, Paris-Nice, LBL, etc.) More realistic peloton We have redesigned the actions of riders in the peloton to recreate the behaviour found in real races: -Favourites ride closer to each other - The yellow jersey is better placed at the front of the peloton -Pursuit of the early breakaway is more realistic with fewer teams getting involved, which gives the leader's team the upper hand, just like in real life - Teams that want to catch the breakaway but don't attack or that reduce the peloton in the race on the flat now have consistent behaviour Revamped objectives Before the start of each stage, you can now set the objective for each rider thanks to a new ""Select Rider"" page, which includes all the information you need to make a choice (ranking, role, race-day condition). Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race. A new recovery mechanic Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating. The lower the rating, the more the recovery profile penalises the race-day condition.","2025-01-28","/game/109504","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/mDRlUb0UyukoAVgxgkjKZ1CF.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA03340_00-TDF2100000000000","85%","0","Sports","314.85","null","null","Tour de France 2021","TRD","NACON SA","2021-07-01","tour-de-france-2021-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","314.85","0","",

Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race. A new recovery mechanic Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating.

Now you must explore the dangerous and abandoned region of Isur and discover its secrets — as they are tightly connected to your own story. To explore the world you will need to use the power gained by combining nature’s four elements — fire, water, air, earth — with various ingredients. By crafting different potions, you will be able to explore the regions of Isur, solve alchemical puzzles, and fight dreadful enemies. Discover Isur Explore the devastated lands and uncover hidden secrets. Your journey will take you through four regions filled with quests, puzzles, enemies of all kinds and bits of lore that will help you to unlock the secrets of a seemingly forsaken region.

Key Features Discover a mysterious world — During the game you will explore different locations, from laboratories and dungeons, to a factory deep inside the heart of a volcano. Each region features unique challenges, sinister secrets, different enemies to fight, and lore to reveal. Concoct potions from the four elements — Use the four basic elements (fire, water, air, earth) along with special ingredients (from cuprum to nigredo) to create bombs, elixirs, and sword oils.

"","2025-02-12","Prepare yourself for the dangers of the cursed castle! Explore 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 rooms of randomly generated hazards and enemies in a retro adventure! Countless heroes have tried and failed to destroy the ancient spell that holds the castle walls. Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside, guarding the sword shards — the last known thing to be capable of defeating the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure. Although you are not alone — some help could be obtained from the merchants, who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them to disappear... Plan your every step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option. There are two difficulty modes: PAL/NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch. Just like in old NES games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found… Features: - Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming. - Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock. - Randomly generated castle, 216 rooms to overcome. - Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming.

Aliens took over the planet thousands of years ago, and the nameless protagonist was kept in a stasis chamber as a twisted relic to memorialize their victory. However, the mysterious Immortal Gate Keeper liberates her and sets her on a dangerous expedition to the Earth’s core.
