In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-12","LowestPrice":"/game/68258","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","MainStory":15,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA01302_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":33,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/deathloop","Title":"DEATHLOOP","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-14","Slug":"deathloop-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":59.99,"MainExtra":22,"SalePrice":23.99,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"88","SaleEnds":"2022-10-27","description":"Reprise your role as a supernatural assassin in Dishonored 2.

The T-126 experimental light tank was built in the summer of 1940 at Leningrad Experimental Automobile Factory #185. The project was developed on the basis of combat experience in Spain with the goal of creating a tank suitable for the conditions of future wars. Only one model of the tank was ever built, and it was never used in combat. The T-126 featured sloping armour, torsion bar suspension, diesel engine, three-man turret, and a commander's cupola, all of which were advanced features at the time. The tank is equipped with a 45 mm 20-K cannon and a 7.62 mm DT machine gun. It is a premium version of the T-50, being its prototype design, it shares it similarities, but actually is better due to much thicker armour all around. Zhukovsky's Chaika is a distinctive vehicle in mainly appearance. It performs very well and can take bombs and rockets into battle. With a forward armament of 4 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, it can quite quickly ruin enemy planes, and its payload options allow it to deal with a couple lightly armoured vehicles while it's over the battlefield. Besides that, Chaika can be equipped with rockets and bombs. It is best used as an air superiority aircraft. Due to its fast climb rate, tight turning radius, and speed, it outperforms many of its contemporaries. The plane is painted after the camouflage scheme of Soviet pilot Sergey Y. Zhukovsky in the 127th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the Soviet Air Forces. All premium vehicles allow you to earn increased Research Points and Silver Lions for each battle and comes furnished with all available modifications.

Following the arrest of a prominent community leader, New York stands in disarray. Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as \u2018Shard\u2019 spreads throughout the underworld. With the city\u2019s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city\u2019s fate. Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to die\u2026 unless you decide they must. Key Features: Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it\u2019s sneaking through levels or attacking head-on Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle A reactive story where the player\u2019s choices have real consequences Stylized pixel art environments and characters Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley Gameplay: Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them. Tackle encounters in lethal, high-octane combat, or use your wits to stick to the shadows, utilizing distraction techniques and non-lethal attacks to reach your objective. Augmentation: Unlock cybernetic upgrades to augment your abilities via upgrade trees, and build upon your playstyle to improve your stealth or increase the lethality of attacks through talent trees. Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground. Reactive Story: Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld.

The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America\u2019s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-12","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2660-CUSA23291_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"66%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":6.11,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Disjunction - Digital Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-28","Slug":"disjunction--digital-deluxe-edition-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":17.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":6.11,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-10-27","description":"Project Starship is back with a wacky take on cosmic horror.

The T-126 experimental light tank was built in the summer of 1940 at Leningrad Experimental Automobile Factory #185. The project was developed on the basis of combat experience in Spain with the goal of creating a tank suitable for the conditions of future wars. Only one model of the tank was ever built, and it was never used in combat. The T-126 featured sloping armour, torsion bar suspension, diesel engine, three-man turret, and a commander's cupola, all of which were advanced features at the time. The tank is equipped with a 45 mm 20-K cannon and a 7.62 mm DT machine gun. It is a premium version of the T-50, being its prototype design, it shares it similarities, but actually is better due to much thicker armour all around. Zhukovsky's Chaika is a distinctive vehicle in mainly appearance. It performs very well and can take bombs and rockets into battle. With a forward armament of 4 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, it can quite quickly ruin enemy planes, and its payload options allow it to deal with a couple lightly armoured vehicles while it's over the battlefield. Besides that, Chaika can be equipped with rockets and bombs. It is best used as an air superiority aircraft. Due to its fast climb rate, tight turning radius, and speed, it outperforms many of its contemporaries. The plane is painted after the camouflage scheme of Soviet pilot Sergey Y.
