Will you reach the center? And if so, what will you discover about yourself there, in the dark? There is but one enemy... But it is the unbeatable Minotaur. Only by exploring the maze of the Labyrinth can you hope to discover how to defeat this immortal monster. The great maze has many tools, many rewards, and many secrets just waiting for you to find them. But you can\u2019t waste your precious time, for the Minotaur is getting ever closer. Dark Flavour The game is inspired by the Greek myth of the labyrinth and the fight between Theseus and the Minotaur. The dark theme is visually expressed by retro pixel art, enriched by voice acting and metaphorical storytelling, creating (we hope) a thrilling atmosphere. The Labyrinth The journey has 6 chapters - each with its own specific challenges, patterns, and rewards. A total of 42 stages, 5 skill upgrades - each with 3 levels, 3 hidden upgrades, 2 unique upgrades, secret passages and Easter eggs. Fair Warning This game is not a rogue-like dungeon crawler, but rather an experience which will ultimately give you the answer to the question: dare you know yourself? Of course, you can simply see it as a guilty pleasure arcade game, just take note: permadeath is unforgiving.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Tauronos_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tauronos-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"0","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k3ZCIRbdYM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"8","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Simulation,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"5.40","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Tauronos.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"64.80","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/50543/tauronos-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"TAURONOS","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Restless Corp","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-03","Slug":"tauronos-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"14.40","ChilePrice":"","Price":"6.99","MexicoPrice":"81.36","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"4.19"},{"CanadaPrice":"9.99","SCORE":"70","SaleEnds":"2022-04-21","LowestPrice":"9.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-14","description":"Embark on a heroic journey to complete missions, battle adorable enemies, and smash everything into tiny cubes!

Descend deep into a new ecology teeming with multiple pathways, luminous levels, and complex obstacles. Transcend the material realm and assume your true form as Spinch, a hyper-agile organism consumed by the quest to rescue its litter of missing offspring from an endless invasion of misshapen and malformed offbeats and oddities. Bringing back old school difficulty, Spinch will have you replaying sections until you master your timing and reflexes. Dash, dodge, climb, swim, jump, and even shoot your own babies as you take on six enigmatic bosses in six vibrant worlds. Collect items to give you the upperhand while searching for your missing babies. Be on the lookout for your cousin - he\'s babysitting some of your relatives, but he\'s a little weird. With only a ticking clock and quick restarts - no lives or game overs - the game is welcoming to players of all experiences, but a formidable challenge to even the most capable of speedrunners. The world of Spinch has been crafted and brought to life by talented award-winning Canadian cartoonist, Jesse Jacobs, known for his precise and detailed line work in combination with bold and simple color palettes. His works contain an affiliation with psychedelia, spirituality, alternate realities, and a blending of nature with technology. James Kirkpatrick, well known for his participation in the early Canadian graffiti movement and as avant-garde hip-hop artist, Thesis Sahib, created the audio landscape of retro soundbites and electronic sounds found within Spinch.

Try to outsmart and outwit all the horrifying creatures you\u2019ll be facing, as they are way stronger and you don\u2019t stand a chance in a direct assault; \u25aa Diverse, challenging opponents. From werewolves to vampires, all monsters have their unique attacks and skills and can easily see, hear or smell you from the distance. So be careful not to reveal your position too early; \u25aa Stamina-based characters. Cautiously manage your energy level between attacking, moving and casting spells. In the end, you\u2019re only a human and running out of energy will seriously fatigue you; \u25aa A grim world plunged in half-darkness.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.

As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality.

Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay You need to conquer a big portion of the initial area that you start the level. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield empties. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and required conquered area percentage for the victory. What happens when you pass a level? You see the related girl\'s photo and can continue with her story or unlock the next girl. How many girls and bosses? 8 girls, 24 bosses, 24 minions, 24 levels, 8 mega levels, 4 traps, 4 power-ups, and 2 towers! Evil towers of course. Each boss and his minions were uniquely designed.

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley\'s Mecha-suit, which she calls \\"Mr. Riggs\\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.<br />CAMPAIGN<br />Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet.

You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission.<br />EXPLORATION<br />Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions.

In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming 8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he takes on hordes of zombies let loose upon the world.<br /><br />Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne.  Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.<br /><br />Protect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic\'s epic story.<br /><br />The Escapists. \xa9 2015.
