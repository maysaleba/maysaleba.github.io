Though the vehicle has grown old, it has become a cornerstone of your family's legacy. Now, in the blink of an eye, your father's gone. Now, the food truck belongs to you. Will you walk in your father's footsteps and live up to his name? Only one way to find out. You can't take the 'truck' out of 'food truck'. Before you can set your stalls up, you have to actually get from your garage to wherever you decide to vend for the day. Be mindful of traffic, and congestions too! When you feel you're short on time do as your father did and veer off the beaten path. First come, first served! You might've thought that all there is to this business is fast food, but now that you're on the other side of the counter it's time to think again.

Each day is a new adventure, and each adventure requires sufficient provisions. Ingredients aren't permanent and will rot and spoil as the hours tick on by.

Honour dad's memory by polishing it one last time. It's been a while since the truck has seen any use. Grab a bucket and a sponge, find a broom and get to cleaning.

Navigate by boat, discover islands, find new allies to help battle foes, and experience a humorous tale about friendship in this melancholic and atmospheric escape. Rich, Story-Driven Adventure Earth may be flooded, but it\u2019s one heck of a view on the water. With a sense of humor, determination, and some great tunes, Nikos and friends will work together to explore the water-filled environment around them and embark on an adventure to evacuate to Mars and start a new life. 3D Exploration & Discovery Float along the vast waterways freely in your boat and explore the many different islands of a beautiful world where you\u2019ll encounter danger, interact with fellow citizens, gather resources, and fight for a chance to escape to a new life. Turn-Based Combat With A Twist Take on your enemies in a classic turn-based combat system where careful tactics and puzzle solving will help you come out alive. Interact with the environment and items around you: knock down a tree, push a shopping cart into an enemy, or duck behind a turned over car to gain the advantage. Original Radio Tunes The world may be ending, but there's still time to enjoy some good tunes. As you cruise along the water, Highwater Pirate Radio is the key source not only of unique and original music, but also for commentary on your ticket to survival. Amid the Great Climate Catastrophe, the flooded region of Hightower has become a kind of safe zone between the two dry regions: the nearly global ravaged land of the War Zone, and the fortified city of Alphaville, where the ultra-rich live behind giant walls. With life on Earth becoming untenable for humans, and rumors of an escape to Mars floating around, Nikos begins a risky journey, picking up friends along the way. First to Hightower, then beyond to cross the impenetrable border of Alphaville, battling insurgents and stealing food along the way.

Play as Liam or Sophia, the newest member of the Lilygrove Scout Corps, as the young mice find themselves on the journey of a lifetime to save their home from ruthless pirates. Will they reach Redwall and save their friends before all is lost? The Scout Act 1 After months of training, betrothed mice Liam and Sophia are ready to graduate into fully-fledged Scouts: a group of woodland rangers tasked with the protection of the land and trained in the ancient ways of woodcraft. Their initiate ceremonies are cut short when sea rats attack their beloved home. As the senior Scouts rally for battle, it's up to the Scout Corps' newest recruit to outwit the enemy, light the beacon, and summon aid from the surrounding woodlands - before there is nothing left to save. The Scout Act 2 The beacon is lit, troops rally to fend off the invading searats, and Liam reunites with his dear Sophia beneath the Lilygrove Lighthouse, but not all is well. Scumsnout's vengeful cries can be heard in the distance and it is revealed that our Scout's betrothed has been poisoned by the wereat's venomous bite. With no time to spare, the couple race to the Winsome Wraith, where a mysterious and dangerous stoat may have the antidote they seek. As if things weren't bad enough, the sea rats are moving inland and the shadow of a large predatory bird lurks just at the edge of the woods. The Scout: Act 3 After being mortally poisoned by Scumsnout's vicious maw, our young Scouts have made it to the Winsome Wraith in one piece, if just barely. While the mysterious stoat's treatment has bought some precious time, Liam and Sophia must now travel the rest of the way to Redwall Abbey for a more permanent cure. This is the dramatic conclusion of their journey through the murk of Portman's Slough, the miraculously-functioning puzzles of Grating Gulley, and the ancient ruins of the Otters' Den. Features - A brand new original story set the winter before the events of the first book. - A stunning woodland world inhabited by charming critters and villainous vermin. - Two characters with divergent dialog for replayability. - Unique real-time scent mechanic fitting for woodlanders who experience the world primarily through their noses. - An assortment of achievements and collectables for the completionist spirit. - Original soundtrack created especially for fans of Redwall. - Fully voice acted by a talented cast of new and established actors. - Engaging puzzles and side stories for those who delight in world building. Mechanics - \"The Scout\" debuts a dynamic scent system unlike any game before it. Rather than stagnant, pre-designed paths that imitate scent, particles read the wind and the environment to simulate realistic currents and pools. Scents themselves consist of parts and patterns designed around real scent theory. - When traversing the world of Mossflower, you make use of your mouse agility to explore the world in a unique and wondrous way. Shimmy along ledges, scramble sheer cliffs, and even squeeze through impossibly small spaces. With courage, faith, and friends by your side, Mossflower's fate rests in your paws! - Rely on stealth, wit, and agility to evade your enemies. Manipulate dull-witted vermin with scent and scent to avoid getting caught in their grubby paws. - Use your trusty way glass to scope the area and identify danger. Rely on your home-made slingshot to solve puzzles, break pots, and activate traps. - Decide if you will prioritize the mission and leave the others to save themselves or take the time to lend a helping paw. Some may praise philanthropy, still others would praise pragmatism.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202310\/2420\/4ba54ae01e578167c094b2026586777854dccd6aa4c40a40.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP2099-CUSA46220_00-0878668103727367","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Family, Adventure, Action","id":"EP2099-CUSA46220_00-0878668103727367","PlusPrice":179.6,"Title":"The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Forthright Entertainment, LLC","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-10","Slug":"the-lost-legends-of-redwall-the-scout-anthology-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"449.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"269.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"","description":"Borzoi Adventure invites players into a whimsical world where they embody the spirited Borzoi, a graceful canine explorer embarking on an epic journey through enchanting realms brimming with treasures and challenges.

Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon to suit your creatures\u2019 needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won\u2019t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil\u2019s most pleasurable holiday paradise. But what is that noise? \u201CGold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!\u201D The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes.

Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! \u2022 Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. \u2022 New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil\u2019s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. \u2022 Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil\u2019s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil\u2019s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. \u2022 Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. \u2022 Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. \u2022 Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.
