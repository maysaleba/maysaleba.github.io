In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/68258","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","MainStory":16,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":34,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/deathloop","Title":"DEATHLOOP","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Bethesda","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-13","Slug":"deathloop-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5UzWC8vRK6","IsPS5":1,"Price":599,"MainExtra":24,"SalePrice":197.67,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"87","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"College dropout Mae Borowski returns home to the crumbling former mining town of Possum Springs seeking to resume her aimless former life and reconnect with the friends she left behind.

Assume the leadership of a medieval noble family, increasing its power and reputation through the generations. As one ruler dies, they are replaced by an heir who may have very different abilities or interests, forcing you to adjust your long term plans. Play a master of the battlefield, conquering your enemies, or play a subtle seeker of secrets, using plots and poison to advance your agenda - all in the same game. Arrange marriages, champion the faith and establish new empires in this modern classic - unlike any other strategy game you\u2019ve ever played on console. HISTORY Choose a royal or noble house from a number of realms on a map that stretches from Iceland to India, from the Arctic Circle to Central Africa. Guide a dynasty through the centuries, ensuring the security and power of each new generation. Gather new lands and titles to cement your legacy. Be a pious king to bring the religious powers to your side, or strike out on your own, designing your own splinter religion and earning everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Knights, peasant revolts, pilgrimages, Viking raiders... experience the drama and pageantry of the Middle Ages! CHARACTER Adopt one of five different lifestyles, perfecting your skills in military strategy or kingdom management. Acquire character traits that will guide your actions, but beware if you act against your nature! The stress from denying your truest self could bring a new host of troubles! Choose appropriate guardians for your heirs, or train them yourself. But what do you do if the legal heir is not quite up to the job? Violent characters may develop a fearsome reputation, cowering your timid subjects into obedience with the dread you inspire. WARFARE Recruit men-at-arms units and powerful knights to supplement your royal levies. Research new technologies to increase the wealth and military might of your realm. Hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major wars. Supplement your income with ransomed prisoners or raiding parties on neighboring realms. INTRIGUE Use your spymaster to discover plots against your dynasty and your rule. Recruit agents to assist your schemes to undermine or murder anyone who stands between you and power. Seduce other characters for love or political power. Gather information for blackmailing purposes or call in favors whenever your plans need an extra bit of influence.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/71763","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/1607/czGau6hOvx9iQYOOkACdxqDl.png?w=200","MainStory":70,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4139-PPSA02308_00-TTL0000000000002","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8N_6xtr0Q","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":696,"genre":"Strategy, Simulation","PlusPrice":999999,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/1607/czGau6hOvx9iQYOOkACdxqDl.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/crusader-kings-iii","Title":"Crusader Kings III","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PARADOX INTERACTIVE AB","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-29","Slug":"crusader-kings-iii-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/6AFCyLN5M1","IsPS5":1,"Price":439,"MainExtra":151,"SalePrice":307.3,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"85","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Control Ultimate Edition contains the main game and all previously released Expansions (\"\"The Foundation\"\" and \"\"AWE\"\") in one great value package.

Together you\u2019ll brave high seas, navigate intense storms, and plumb the perils of a briny deep. Along the way, you\u2019ll need to keep things functioning by unlocking parts, fixing faults and searching the watery depths for precious fuel and salvage. The farther you travel, the more you\u2019ll learn about your ship\u2019s fascinating complexities.

There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. STORY MODE The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episodes 1+2 were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - \u201cDO NOT GO GENTLE\u201d Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - \u201cLUMINACE FUGUE\u201d Mackenzie\u2019s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? EPISODE THREE - \"CROSSROADS ELEGY\" In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? EPISODE FOUR - \"FURY, THEN SILENCE\" A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. SURVIVAL MODE Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/21471","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202109/2306/ChPARRL6cgDRc3GuWkLZOZIa.png?w=200","MainStory":20,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2845-CUSA09690_00-TLDRKFULLGAMEPS4","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmKtKlufjwo","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":233,"genre":"Action, Adventure, Adventure","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202109/2306/ChPARRL6cgDRc3GuWkLZOZIa.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-long-dark","Title":"The Long Dark","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Hinterland Studio Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2017-08-08","Slug":"the-long-dark-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/9zRvcaW4Fk","IsPS5":0,"Price":299,"MainExtra":48,"SalePrice":149.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"75","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT VR is the definitive VR FPS in which time moves only when you move.

Solve puzzles and face sinister enemies in deadly combat in this relentless nightmare as Caroline Walker hunts for missing twin girls in a cavernous abandoned mansion. Can you confront your fears and uncover the secrets of Winterlake... or will you die trying? Something Evil Lurks at Winterlake While investigating the disappearance of twin girls at Winterlake, something terrible happens to Caroline Walker. Waking in the dead of night, naked and hooked up to some kind of outdated medical equipment in a bathtub, Caroline must fight for her life as she explores the halls of the abandoned mansion. A Return to Classic Survival Horror Tormented Souls draws inspiration from classic survival horror like From Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Alone in the Dark. A modern take on the fixed-perspective action-adventure game, it offers a modernised control scheme and dynamic camera combined with classic gameplay. Deadly Combat Dark forces and unspeakable horrors will do everything in their power to stop Caroline getting to the truth. Use anything and everything that you can find to fight back against evils lurking in the darkness. Keep Your Wits About You You'll need much more than a steady aim and sharp reflexes to make it out alive. Search the environment for anything you can use to your advantage. Combine items to solve twisted puzzles and use every resource available to explore the secrets of the mansion and its grounds. Fiendish Puzzles Scavenge essential resources and tools, decipher clues from long-forgotten journals, and combine it all to solve fiendish puzzles and get to the bottom of the mansion's sordid history. Gateways to Another Dimension Nothing is quite as it seems at Winterlake. Mirrors provide a path to an alternate reality and another place in time. By crossing these shimmering gateways, Caroline can manipulate the very fabric of reality in surprising ways. You Are Not Alone in the Dark The mansion may seem abandoned, but as Caroline investigates its secrets, dark forces and unspeakable horrors will do everything in their power to stop her getting to the truth. Be sure to be alert at all times, and use anything you can find to fight off the encroaching terrors of Winterlake. Just remember: gaze into the darkness, and it also gazes into you... Can Caroline Walker escape with the truth and escape with her life?","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/89133","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/8Cw9tryQWwC0R8Fc4ReBZLc8.png?w=200","MainStory":8,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4293-PPSA02526_00-TORMENTEDSIEEPS5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW2cX5Kxbwc","PercentOff":"55%","Completionist":14,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":80.55,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/8Cw9tryQWwC0R8Fc4ReBZLc8.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/tormented-souls","Title":"Tormented Souls","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PQube Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2021-08-27","Slug":"tormented-souls-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/qDgde26xG","IsPS5":1,"Price":179,"MainExtra":10,"SalePrice":80.55,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"72","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

Until one day, when the mayor's daughter falls ill, and the local witch doctor can do nothing to help her, they are forced to look outside their small community for help. The Medical Association decides to send their most accomplished chemist - you - to help cure the mayor's daughter and convince the residents of Moonbury of the wonders of modern alchemy. Gain their trust and tend to each person when they fall ill in this open-ended sim RPG. Take care of residents. Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed. Diagnose symptoms and find a cure! Hmm... a low heart rate and a bloated liver. Shoulder cramps, perhaps? No, these are sure signs of burning lungs. This patient has been consuming too much gelatin! Easily remedied; you'll just need to craft some Minty Goblet. Gather ingredients out in the world. Once you've decided on a potion, ointment, or salve, gather ingredients from the surrounding environment using your tools. Upgrade your hammer, axe, and sickle for new swings and attacks to help with your day-to-day tasks. Watch out for changing weather conditions! You may find yourself caught out in the rain, a freezing blizzard, or even the baking heat of a desert. Confront nasty monsters for their materials. Sometimes you won't be able to gather the materials you need as easily as harvesting a berry bush, and you'll need to turn your trusty tools into weapons to collect materials from the monsters prowling the nearby wilderness. Combat is in real-time and, since you're a chemist, you'll be able to brew various concoctions to buff yourself or inflict status ailments on your adversaries, as well as various tools to aid you. Brew remedies in your cauldron. The ingredients you gather can be mixed in your cauldron to brew medicine, vitamins, and more. As you become more experienced, higher-level recipes will become available, requiring more ingredients but bestowing stronger effects. Enhance your cauldron to concoct more ingredients into your recipes for these more advanced remedies. Build relationships with the townsfolk. It'll take a little while, but your patients' health will be much better thanks to your efforts. Your reputation with them will increase, and they'll open up to you a little more. You may even find yourself growing particularly close to certain bachelors or bachelorettes. Upgrade the town and surrounding areas. Building relationships with townsfolk increases your approval rating, allowing you to improve public buildings and expanding the explorable areas around the town. You can also craft and buy new furniture to give your home a personal touch! Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. In the downtime between treating the community's ailments, you'll be able to freely explore in and around Moonbury. Get to know the inhabitants a little better, take a rest in the tavern, or go fishing to catch something for dinner. Moonbury is a delightfully charming location where time seems a little slower and life is just a little more relaxed than the big city. While the lighting will change throughout the day, with the bright sun streaking across the meadows in the morning and street lamps illuminating the town in the early evening, there are no time limits for game objectives. Spend time with a faithful companion. You didn't relocate to Moonbury alone! With you every step of the way is your loyal dog companion. Your pet can help you locate hidden items and point you in the direction of residents as they go about their day.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/85618","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1514/macP3Eb2PKvBNNY2LhFNlzFx.png?w=200","MainStory":24,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4293-PPSA02687_00-POTIONPERMITSIEE","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WvP403k63A","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":28,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":149.25,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1514/macP3Eb2PKvBNNY2LhFNlzFx.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/potion-permit","Title":"Potion Permit","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PQube Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-21","Slug":"potion-permit-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/AUOC72ThWz","IsPS5":1,"Price":199,"MainExtra":28,"SalePrice":149.25,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"70","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"SpellForce III Reforced is a unique mix of an epic RPG storyline blended with accessible real-time strategy elements, designed to offer a riveting console experience to fans and newcomers alike.

Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/87808","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","MainStory":5,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0102-CUSA24163_00-MAKAIRE000000001","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F177-VTSGSM","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":11,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":149.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection","Title":"Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"CE EUROPE LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-31","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/1AqX2eD0an","IsPS5":0,"Price":299,"MainExtra":6,"SalePrice":149.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Twin Breaker: A Sacred Symbols Adventure is a story-driven brick breaking game molded in the style of \u201880s arcade classics like Arkanoid and Breakout, but with a plot, characters, and meaning!

This fighting game gained popularity for its smooth visuals powered by S.M.A as well as the high level of strategy driven by its 2-gauges system. And with the addition of new current-gen features it's even easier to play. - Battle Mechanics Polished to a Shine by a Legendary Studio Known for Fighters: The first original fighting game from Dimps, known for being involved in a number of other fighting games. It has continued to attract fighting game fans since its release in 2005 with mechanics that use 2 gauges--one for offense and one for defense--and slick 2D visuals powered by S.M.A. (Smooth Model Animation). - New Features for Console Provide a Modern Gameplay Experience: The console version contains new features such as an Online Versus Mode--a first for the series. It uses Rollback Netcode, which corrects lag between players, making for a streamlined experience online. And with 16:9 wide-screen support, AI and a training mode, you can fully enjoy this game in the comfort of your own home. - Main Game Modes: ・Arcade ・Survival ・Time Attack ・Local Multiplay ・Online Multiplay with rollback netcode ・Training ・Gallery New features for update 2.0 (3/2/2023): Rematch option after matches, spectator mode for online play, combat range setting (short/wide), match time settings, enemy attack/health regeneration settings for training mode, and other game balance adjustments. - The Story: It is the end of the 20th century... A large-scale natural disaster struck the eastern area of a nation. It wiped out the financial sector and resulted in a staggering loss of life. At the dawn of the 21st century, the conglomerate PROBE-NEXUS, commonly known as Probe, began reconstruction efforts in that eastern area. Colossal capital and cutting-edge technology was poured into rebuilding it. Skyscrapers that put the old high-rises to shame along with the world's biggest shopping mall and recreational facilities. This was the dazzling birth of a symbol for the new century. It was christened Zone Prime. And now, in an undeveloped sector of its western block, there was an area known as the slums...","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/0202/DCaeNvGN60tAc7przSOxR8ee.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4579-PPSA09141_00-TRF20000000PS5EU","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":"","genre":"Fighting","PlusPrice":239.2,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/0202/DCaeNvGN60tAc7przSOxR8ee.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/the-rumble-fish-2","Title":"The Rumble Fish 2","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"3GOO K.K.","ReleaseDate":"2022-12-07","Slug":"the-rumble-fish-2-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5AMfkTp312","IsPS5":1,"Price":299,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":239.2,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"68","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Fight for the yellow jersey in the official game of the Tour de France 2022.

You start at the lowest levels and must prove yourself to receive invitations from organizers to high-profile races. Create your own tour with My Tour mode and the 92 stages available.

NEW FEATURES - New online mode with leaderboard - Race incidents (falls, illnesses\u2026) - New preparation system - New interface on cobbled sections - More intense races with a more aggressive peloton and more collaborative breakaways - All 21 official stages of the Tour de France 2022 - New \"\"Primavera Classic\"\" inspired by a major Italian race - 3 new teams: Eolo-Kometa Cycling Team, Caja Rural-Seguros RGA and Uno-X Pro Cycling Team- NEW ONLINE MODE: RACE OF THE WEEK Enjoy a new challenge each week, competing against players from all over the world as you try to reach the top of the leaderboard!

NEW: RACE INCIDENTS You can now choose to enable or disable race incidents and their consequences. If you enable them (for yourself and your opponents or just your opponents), you can choose their frequency and enable or disable their consequences, which vary depending on the incident's severity: loss of power for a short or long duration, or even withdrawal. Be prepared to adapt because your strategy might need to be completely re-evaluated at any moment. NEW: RACE PREPARATION To add more unpredictability to races, a new preparation system has been added. Five random cyclists (from your team or in the peloton) will be especially well prepared for the race and five others may potentially underperform. Unfortunately, you can't know who these cyclists will be\u2026 You will need to keep an eye on all your opponents.

There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot.

You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others.

The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible.

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike. There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series. This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians. Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields. It\u2019s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive \u2013 lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Just make sure you don\u2019t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies! The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front), with a new game Isonzo coming soon with mountain warfare on the Italian Front! These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references. **Cross play supported between console platforms.**","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/53337","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202002/2812/7lTuF0Wo4f9DT4oMjxx2xks4.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1662-PPSA02756_00-9956598540657310","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE32n9kUddU","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":21,"genre":"Action, Shooter, Shooter","PlusPrice":59.7,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202002/2812/7lTuF0Wo4f9DT4oMjxx2xks4.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/tannenberg","Title":"Tannenberg","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BlackMill Games B.V.","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-15","Slug":"tannenberg-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/7pNQypcSTC","IsPS5":1,"Price":199,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":59.7,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"61","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"RECLAIM YOUR HUMANITY There\u2019s no rest when survival is on the line.

The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man\u2019s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn\u2019t for the faint hearted! Looking for more WW1 action? Check out Tannenberg for Eastern Front maneuver warfare, or the upcoming Isonzo for Italian mountain warfare!","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/18125","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202012/0822/DTzPcBOwcSWWl5HrVa1d8jYE.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1662-PPSA02758_00-1206800080748220","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XboXaVzjoe4","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Shooter, Shooter","PlusPrice":59.7,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202012/0822/DTzPcBOwcSWWl5HrVa1d8jYE.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/verdun","Title":"Verdun","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BlackMill Games B.V.","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-15","Slug":"verdun-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/8A0HNRx7Rc","IsPS5":1,"Price":199,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":59.7,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"56","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Just Die Already is an old people mayhem sandbox game created by the designers of Goat Simulator.

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. The game centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It\u2019s a shockingly enjoyable sci-fi action running game where the player uses techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts. As well as these evasive elements there\u2019s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action bundle and with it re-invents the running game genre.

The voices they hear will help them identify potential suspects and solve the mysteries. What is it that\u2019s connecting seemingly unrelated cases? This edition also contains \"The Lethal Script\" case that will have the detectives investigating a movie industry mystery on The Peak Hotel. Put on your headphones and step back into the past. Use the voices you hear to return to crime scenes, tracking down each individual involved and solving the cases. But where do the voices come from? Can you trust what you hear? And what's the mysterious thread weaving all of these cases together? A Unique Case-Solving Experience Discover the truth hidden in the voices from the past. Step through time as you use our device to eavesdrop on conversations from past crime scenes. Every clue, every move, and every motive will be presented in the form of audio. Rather than controlling any one character, you only need listen to their conversations, following along as the story evolves. Use the information you hear to match names to voices and determine how everything (and everyone) is related. Can you discover the truth? Open-Ended Narrative Mystery Game Explore the story and piece together the puzzle in your own way! Don't expect to be \"fed\" a pile of clues. Rather, take the role of a fly on the wall, observing and listening to the events as they unfold. Anyone could be the culprit; key clues may be revealed at any second; any character's storyline may cross paths with another at any point in time.

Enjoy an all-new, unique co-op experience by playing both Kuuta and Kazemaru at the same time! ■A different way to level up! Kisejima, where the game takes place, is divided into three areas with a variety of challenges ranging from fighting enemies to escort missions. The player can also level up by running away from pursuing monsters, like a game of tag, and collecting mushrooms that grow in clusters to purchase upgraded clubs. [What is ONI : Road to be the Mightiest Oni?] ■Setting: Kisejima Island The story takes place on Kisejima, a small island in the middle of the ocean. Here, it is said that the power that lies dormant within the local demon spirits can be drawn out by challenging them to trials, where ancient demons who were once defeated by Momotaro are summoned to battle. However, few have ever returned from Kisejima alive. ■Characters: Kuuta, a demon warrior, and his spirit partner, Kazemaru Kuuta, the protagonist, is the only survivor of the Demon King's army that faced Momotaro in battle. He and Kazemaru, a mysterious spirit that lives on Kisejima, team up to take on challenges of all shapes and sizes! ■Artwork by KENEI DESIGN Kisejima may not be large, but the colorful artwork by KENEI DESIGN, with its dazzling green meadows, looming forests, and plains of floating megaliths, offers a unique emotional impact unlike any other action game.

The following excerpt was retrieved from the short story \u201cCobra da Várzea\u201d, published in a clandestine local paper from Salvador (Bahia), United States of Brazil (Typewritten translation attached) It's three after midnight, and the only light for leagues comes from the small fire she built in the sand. She works a knife with steady, agile fingers and carefully carves out her prize. When it gives in, it is with a wet sound, and she closes her hand around it like an embrace. At her feet, four men protest in muffled whimpers, facing the night with bleeding holes where they once had eyes. When the fishermen find them, they will be dressed in white by the waves of the Atlantic, awaiting final judgment for sins the courts of men had swiftly forgiven. By then, she will be long gone. \u201cIt's Biatatá\u2019s doing.\u201d The hushed whispers will spread through the streets and the pews. Some will call her a hero, others a murderer, and the superstitious will insist on the stories of a fiery snake stealing men's eyes and driving them mad. Above all, the people will ask, and the papers will plead, why? Rolling the fresh eyeball in her fingers, she wonders, not for the first time, if she could ever answer. She never believed in justice, and she can't remember the last time she enjoyed revenge. All she remembers is being small and scrawny and invisible in a crowd of too many. Falling and being used as pavement. Bleeding and being left to rot. She asked why many times, and when the answer came to her, it felt like soothing to a burn. Perhaps the reason for one\u2019s evil is simply that one can. And if so, then her own reasons could be just as plain. Not a savior nor a beast. She kills these wretched men because she can, and others won't. She throws the eye into the flames and takes a deep breath before smiling. Tomorrow, she travels North to colder lands, on the trail of worse evils and tougher choices. But tonight, the salty air of Salvador warms her skin, and as the men\u2019s cries fade into silence, she knows these dead will not come back.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/1519/3b9e564f3dc035e378bb2eaf3e3a0882f6c8291488df0109.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-THEHUNTGAME00051","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":79.2,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/1519/3b9e564f3dc035e378bb2eaf3e3a0882f6c8291488df0109.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Hunt: Showdown - Biatatá - Still Waters Run Deep","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Crytek Gmbh","ReleaseDate":"2023-03-08","Slug":"hunt-showdown--biatat--still-waters-run-deep-playstation-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":79.2,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Are you the new quiz master and can you beat your friends on this quiz?

Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin\u2019s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind\u2019s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra\u2019s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra\u2019s discoveries as she learns more about her family\u2019s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra\u2019s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player\u2019s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra\u2019s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways.

The Princess Joins the Battle! With the full release of Brave's Rage, players will now have access to a 9th playable Brave, the Princess, in addition to the already existing eight Braves, each with their own unique set of skills, playstyle, and deck pool. Of course, players will have to defeat some of the most fearful foes first to bring her back to the Kingdom. But don't forget - it's dangerous to go alone! So players will be able to recruit a second Brave in the Tavern every time they embark on their new journey. The game will introduce new Braves as the adventure progresses. Explorer Evra, Lord Don Qui, Protector Sancho...and many more! Always create a duo in order to advance further. Construct strategies and find synergies, double the builds and quadruple the fun!

DELVE INTO THE LORE Evil has been vanquished. Peace has returned to Ancardia, and the peasants dare to dream once more of prosperity. Seven very different factions vie for control over the cataclysmic aftermath left behind by Andor Drakon\u2019s defeat. And somewhere, deep down in an inhospitable cave, ChAoS is stirring again. Pick up your blade, prepare your spells, check your daggers and ready your bow, for you are about to enter the ominous Caverns of Chaos. Choose your allegiance carefully, for you are nothing more than an expendable asset to the masters you choose.

While her sisters daydreamed of crowns, gems and new dresses, Elena delved into the darkest caves, explored catacombs in search of eerie secrets and mysteries. And even status of chief maid of honor didn\u2019t dampen her ardor. Incidentally, the queen never objected to her subject\u2019s daring, bravery and desperate curiosity. Her Majesty had given Elena complex, and sometimes dangerous tasks more than once. Soon Elena and her friends and allies \u2013 Percy and Jorik \u2013 created a team that could solve any puzzle and handle the most difficult of tasks. All members of the royal family respected Elena. The maid of honor was particularly friendly with the Prince, the young nephew of His Majesty. He had long dreamed to take part in the adventures of Elena and her team, and he finally got the chance. The queen\u2019s favorite corgi Buttercup went missing. The Prince knew Buttercup better than anyone from the team, which meant he could help Elena and her friends search for the queen\u2019s beloved pet. As dusk began to fall, the team set off to scour the palace grounds, but Buttercup was nowhere to be found. \u201cShe probably ran off into the woods,\u201d the Prince suggested. \u201cWe need to search there.\u201d Trusting the Prince\u2019s intuition, Elena, Jorik and Percy walked into the woods and followed the young man into its very depths. They walked in complete silence, when suddenly they heard voices and a dog barking nearby. As they crept up to the source of the sound, the friends saw two strangers in masks trying to shove a protesting and snarling corgi into a bag. \u201cLet\u2019s surround them and capture them,\u201d Percy suggested. The friends nodded in response and split up, cutting off the villains\u2019 retreat. Then a branch treacherously broke beneath the Prince\u2019s feet. They had no time to waste \u2013 the friends jumped out of cover and rushed toward the kidnappers, but they dropped the corgi and the bag on the ground and ran into the gloom of the woods. \u201cWait, where\u2019s the prince?\u201d Jorik asked, looking from side to side.

Play in free style or against the timer with one or two grappling guns and finish more than 10 enormous levels by dodging obstacles and deadly traps. It\u2019s easy to play, it\u2019s fast and it\u2019s fun. You start the game in the middle of a giant city surrounded by skyscrapers. You look around and see a giant poster that explains the general movement. This way you learn that you are able to dash while being in the air. You also realize that you have a grappling gun in your hand and see floating crystals above your head. You aim at the crystals and use your grappling gun to hook onto them. Once hooked you start swinging and swing towards the next crystal. You hook on to the next crystal and have already mastered the main movement mechanism. After a couple of hooks, you realize that you can change your swinging direction and speed by dashing into the wanted direction. This is the second important thing to learn about the movement and gives you a lot of freedom in your movement. Soon you will reach the next giant poster which explains further movement patterns that you can use to improve your precision and movements. You learn that you can remove your grappling hook, use an in-air dash and then hook on to the next floating crystal to build up speed and energy. You can use this energy to collect hidden achievements, dash through activator crystals, that unlock new areas o the level, or speed run levels later on. Furthermore, you realize that the dash refreshes every couple of seconds which leads to an incredibly fast and satisfying movement once you are able to master it.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0616/xTpaVApaeqWLeKILuhVo3DMo.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6556-CUSA36652_00-7394737770687028","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Casual, Family","PlusPrice":49.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0616/xTpaVApaeqWLeKILuhVo3DMo.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Grappling Dash","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"EpiXR Games UG","ReleaseDate":"2022-12-20","Slug":"grappling-dash-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":59.4,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Experience Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus originally released on the PlayStation® console, enhanced with up-rendering, rewind, quick save, and custom video filters.

Discover spectacular new prehistoric species, three new islands, detailed Malta-inspired buildings, and an all-new campaign in Jurassic World Evolution 2: Dominion Malta Expansion. NEW CAMPAIGN EXPERIENCE Before the events of Jurassic World Dominion, help lead a brand new enterprise in Malta. Work alongside Cabot Finch and key figures from the film, including Kayla Watts (voiced by DeWanda Wise), Soyona Santos (voiced by Dichen Lachman), Barry Sembène (voiced by Omar Sy), and Lewis Dodgson (voiced by Campbell Scott) as you set up parks across three Mediterranean locations. Establish key buildings, and trade on the dinosaur exchange to acquire more species, eggs, and even genome data. Work with both the Underground and Authorities and build trust with these organisations via various actions to unlock further opportunities such as, hatchery upgrades, locations and more. NEW LOCATIONS AND BUILDINGS Create all-new parks containing a range of exciting buildings with a film-inspired theme, including the new Acquisition Centre, viewing gallery, hotel, and more. Seat your ranger, MVU, and capture teams in new-style vehicles, and add fresh decorations to make your parks stand out. Build across three new locations set in the Mediterranean, one of which boasts a natural lagoon. All Malta buildings are available to use in sandbox mode. NEW PREHISTORIC SPECIES AND SKINS Host four captivating dinosaurs as seen in Jurassic World Dominion. Faithfully created to mirror their film counterparts, these iconic prehistoric species are ready to give guests an unforgettable experience. Furthermore, Jurassic World Evolution 2: Dominion Malta Expansion features stunning new variants of existing species and additional film skins, so you can give your dinosaurs a bold new look with different patterns and colours. The pack contains: NEW DINOSAURS Atrociraptor (with 4x movie \u2018squad\u2019 skins) Arguably even more dangerous than its velociraptor cousins, the Atrociraptor has a bulkier body and boxier snout. The coloration varies wildly between individuals. Lystrosaurus A short, squat herbivore with powerful forelimbs and an unusually shaped skull that lived around 250 million years ago. The Lystrosaurus is notable for its tusks and horned beak, used to bite bits of vegetation. Oviraptor A smaller predator with a distinctive head crest, the Oviraptor has a unique feathered look. Originally believed to steal eggs of other dinosaurs, it was dubbed the \u2018Egg Thief\u2019, but it has since been understood to be an omnivore with a powerful jaw for its size.

Each new item offers further customisation to your ultimate build, allowing for truly unique set ups. Do you want to get in close as a melee fighter or take shots from afar as a ranged marksman? Set yourself up with a drone who can do the fighting for you or create an engineering build who can lay down traps and turrets as you back enemies into them. Completing quests will also grant you temporary perks, making each run feel fresh as you may not get the same perks to choose from next time! The possibilities are endless and there is no correct way to overcome the ever-shifting procedural rooms of the mansion. The mansion itself also has a dimension-hopping twist. Each floor contains portals that lead you to alternate versions of the same location. Each dimension switches up the aesthetics and gameplay. You always start in the NeoCortex dimension, which plays out like an escape room, filled with challenges, puzzles and surprises. From there, you will receive quests that take you into the Reptilian Complex and the Limbic System Dimensions. In the Reptilian Complex, the mansion takes on a fiery appearance as it is overrun with monsters. The Limbic system sees an icy chill overtake the mansion. You\u2019ll need to move quickly and stay near heat sources as the cold damages you on your search for hidden items or torches to light up. With a variety of enemies, clues, quests, secrets, loot and compelling logic puzzles scattered throughout the mansion, there is always something intriguing to discover on each run. There\u2019s always something for you to keep track of - from kit upgrades, puzzles that need solving or quests to complete. Between each level a musical interlude will reveal more of the twisting story, with decisions you make throughout your run subtly affecting the final outcome - with 27 different possible endings wrapping up the tale.

The first time Claeg realized something was wrong was when he went out on an errand for his wife Emma. He kissed her goodbye and mounted his horse to ride into town, but when he blinked once again, he was five miles away from home and his horse lay bleeding from its throat. He walked all the way back home covered in blood to meet the panicked tears of his wife, children, and friends. From then on, it took Claeg every fiber of his being to concentrate even on the smallest task. Doing work on the farm became insurmountable labor, and his children wept in the corners when he mixed up their names and faces. Emma took him to countless doctors who couldn\u2019t give a name to his ailment, but any person of the cloth they met all said the same thing: A demon was slowly taking over Claeg\u2019s body, and he was in dire need of salvation. \u201cThe demon is only sated after sacrifice!\u201d The good Christians would wail. \u201cStop him before it\u2019s too late.\u201d But the time to stop Claeg never came. And when he awoke one day to his friend\u2019s blood upon his throwing axe, his wails of anguish echoed through the town. It was death that brought Claeg back to life, and so Emma brought him to the man in DeSalle who they knew dealt in death. And death he dealt. Waking to become himself only when blood caked his hands, and his prey took their last breath. Countless has to die so that he, in a sense, wouldn\u2019t. So that he remembered the reason he lived this torturous existence. So that he could remember the laughs of his children and the touch of his wife. So that no demon could take his place. Claeg Grey donned the mask and robe not for himself, but for the sake of his family. So that no one would know his true self. So that his loved ones could finally find peace once more. And so that he could find clarity in freely administering death.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/2603/GQUzjouGDl0oxk0cmSu4j4Rs.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-THEHUNTGAME00046","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":69.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/2603/GQUzjouGDl0oxk0cmSu4j4Rs.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Hunt: Showdown \u2013 Fear The Reaper","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Crytek Gmbh","ReleaseDate":"2022-10-25","Slug":"hunt-showdown--fear-the-reaper-playstation-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":69.3,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"You can now travel through Östertörn on new types of Motorbikes!

You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies. Possible alternate history flow - what would have happened if the Allies followed the ideas of Operation Unthinkable and went to war against the USSR in 1946? Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Advanced army manager - choose the composition of your forces. Acquire new units, upgrade or dismiss the outdated ones. Make sure that your forces have all the necessary tools for the upcoming battle. Real WW2 heroes - assign historical personalities to your armies and get access to special skills. Realistic 3D graphics - study the battle map and take advantage of 3D graphics, featuring volumetric terrain and physically-simulated movement of units.

Recruit a company of up to three mortal heroes and guide them in spirit on a desperate journey from Albion to Jerusalem. Explore a richly-imagined medieval setting on the brink of apocalypse. Trade with merchants, improve your heroes and unearth ancient relics. Search for the lost fragments of your soul, scattered across the multiverse - and save as many worlds as you can. KEY FEATURES: A Roguelike Experience Carve a path across the lands of Albion, Marca Hispanica and Al-Andalus. Will you take a dangerous route, risking life and limb in pursuit of a legendary relic? Or will you choose a safer path? Plan and prepare. Negotiate, barter, fight. Tackle challenges. Suffer losses. Recruit new Heroes. Earn Gold, Supplies and Renown. Be careful: your choices are permanent, as is death. But don't tarry - evil never rests. Tactical Turn-Based Combat Master the tactics of squad-based and turn-based combat to conquer both human and demonic foes. Your enemies will be tough and ruthless; make use of high ground and cover, set up ambushes and coordinated attacks, harness synergies between different Hero classes and skills. Non-Linear Narrative Enjoy a compelling story inspired by Arthurian legend, the Matter of France, and the history of Al-Andalus - with an unusual twist. Make choices in interactive encounters that change every time you play. Written by Jonas Kyratzes (The Talos Principle, Serious Sam 4) and Verena Kyratzes (The Lands of Dream, Serious Sam 4). Hard Mode Suited for only the bravest adventurers. Experience an even greater challenge with complex resource management and tougher enemies. Earn Essence with each run that can be exchanged for Blessings and Curses, adding temporary benefits and burden in equal measure to your next run. Dynamic Leveling Use Renown to level up your Heroes, and choose between a randomized set of new skills or improved attributes. But choose wisely! Select skills with great synergy and balance your party for the road ahead. Equipment Upgrades Seek out towns to improve your arms and armor, or stumble upon hermit artisans in the wild. With every day that passes, the world plunges deeper into darkness, and you will need all the equipment gold can buy. Relics From a peasant's humble luck charm to the legendary sword wielded by Arthur himself, items imbued with magical power are scattered about the world. Some you will be able to purchase from merchants and collectors, but others will have to be earned through acts of heroism - or displays of wit. Spells Rain thunder and brimstone upon your foes! Seek out and gather Soulstones to restore your power and unlock new Spells. Even if defeated, your spirit will retain all of your collected arcane knowledge as you jump into the next dimension. Alternate Dimensions As you jump from one parallel dimension to the next, history is reshaped. Different kings rule the land, changing the encounters, characters, and events. No two worlds are ever quite the same, and each journey will be unique. And should your heroes fall, remember: defeat is not the end, only a new beginning. There are as many worlds as there are stars in the sky. In each stands Camelot; in each there is a Grail. But there is only one Merlin, and his eternal burden is to stand against the horror from beyond. Each world that is saved is saved forever; each world that is lost is lost for good.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/92277","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png?w=200","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0131-PPSA04468_00-THEHANDMERLINPS5","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":114,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Hand of Merlin","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"VERSUS EVIL","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-14","Slug":"the-hand-of-merlin-playstation-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":285,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":114,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Darkness Rollercoaster - Ultimate Shooter Edition is an extraordinary adventure where the action is omnipresent!

While the checkpoints in East Berlin are still being overrun by crowds of people, Nora escapes from this world, into unknown layers of time and into an unknown fate. STORY: Berlin, 9th November 1989: The streets are full of people. After four decades of division, thousands of cars are rolling across the inner-German border. The Wall is finally open! At the same time a man disappears in a secret research facility near East Berlin. His goodbye message reaches you too late. You drive back to the office, where the State Security has already destroyed all records of the research project. The complex is deserted and empty.

So what shall it be, Space Pioneer, when you are the Captain of it all? BUILD A WONDROUS VIEW Build, install and redesign your station to perfection in a full 3D view taking advantage of the spectacular visuals provided by Unreal Engine 4. Look at your creation in a 360 degrees view, zooming in and out to marvel at its beauty. Look at the magnificent in-game star constellations, nebulas and planets the development team spent weeks researching to realistically provide in-game visualisations within the endless game sky. FOCUS ON THE ABSTRACT Monitor and set up production cycles, resources and their distribution. Focus either on efficiency or yield, treating everything as a diligent spreadsheet master - but with an abstract layout system resembling a circuit board to help you design the best connections, nooks and crannies to make your station a resounding engineering success! ECONOMICS, ERRORS AND MORE! A unique economic system provides you with a key objective - make your station efficient and profitable or fail! The normal route of business can be, however, disrupted by a number of disruptions: from hacker attacks to error and malfunctions each module and its system entail in your management of the station. Your production may also simply overload, given the production strain - so plan, execute and design to perfection! EXPLORE UNKNOWN PLANETS There are 3 distinct campaign missions where you need to terraform a given planet, make it habitable and easy to extract resources from. Built with a background narrative, each of these missions enable you to focus on the two game modes in order to build your station in such a way as to successfully fulfill their objectives. Are you going to be the most efficient, the most industrious or have the most graphically appealing modules set-up? Anything goes as long as the mission is successful! ENDLESS DREAMS You can also kick back and focus on building the greatest and either best looking or most efficient station there ever was - within either our Creative or Endless modes built especially for this purpose. orbit.industries blends inspiration from classic science fiction literature, movies, and popular space-opera TV series with actual knowledge and progress achieved in the field of space exploration, space engineering, and orbital stations development.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/0909/FcILE6TDqRKX9oWlXKd9X6M4.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA05565_00-1642117917262637","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Simulation","PlusPrice":103.95,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/0909/FcILE6TDqRKX9oWlXKd9X6M4.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"orbit.industries","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Klabater","ReleaseDate":"2022-04-21","Slug":"orbitindustries-playstation-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":189,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":113.4,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Chernobylite is a science-fiction survival horror RPG from developers The Farm 51.

PlatinumGames\u2019 NEO-CLASSIC ARCADE series carries on the spirit and fun of classic gaming using modern technology, and the first project in this endeavor is SOL CRESTA. SOL CRESTA takes the docking and formation strategies of classic shooting games Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta and elevates them with the \u201cfree-form docking\u201d system. The flagship Yamato, composed of the fighters Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susano can utilize various attacks depending on how the three ships are aligned. Docking, splitting, and reforming the ships as needed is the key to defeating the invading armies of Mega Zofer. Story Humanity faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Mandler Army during their last invasion of the solar system. Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune. With the last of their hope, they formed the solar recovery squad SOL CRESTA, and placed the fate of the solar system with the Yamato, a cutting-edge docking ship. -Free-Form Docking The Yamato, standing against the evil of Mega Zofer, is composed of 3 fighters. You\u2019ll scramble with only one fighter at first, but pick up the right item and friendly fighters will appear for a power-up!

Get a babysitter for the kids, this game is a madcap, mile-a-minute spree of spies, dives, and gun-toting bad guys that will have you on the edge of your seat. You take on the role of Jack, a handsome, jaded former intelligence officer pulled out of his retired life as a strip club regular for one last mission to stop the villainous virologist Krueger, who plans to unleash a mind-controlling virus on the unsuspecting citizens of L.A. Everyone is out to kill Jack now that he\u2019s hot on Krueger\u2019s trail, and he\u2019ll need to use his mind, muscles, and mojo to stay alive long enough to stop Kruger\u2019s plot.

A restoration and remaster of a game lost to time for over 25 years, American Hero was originally designed for the Atari Jaguar CD as a \u201cplayable movie\u201d with a groundbreaking, more fluid presentation than the FMV games of its time.

CRAFT AND UPGRADE - Upgrade Alma through an extensive upgrade tree via chips you\u2019ll find throughout your journey. Chips can be crafted or discovered, and each offers different bonus effects. Experiment with nearly limitless builds from the fast and efficient to the powerful and stylish. CHOICES MATTER - Alma\u2019s withering life force ticks away in real-time and is the driving factor in the story of UNSIGHTED. Tarry too long in one spot, and you may find that critical NPCs have already become Unsighted before you meet them. Save or drain other Automatons of their anima for your survival. The constant passage of time can result in vastly different endings and allows for further playthroughs to stay fresh and exciting. HIGHLY REPLAYABLE + CO-OP - In addition to the main story UNSIGHTED also features additional challenge modes, BOSS RUSH and DUNGEON RAID. You can also bring a friend along your journey through Arcadia through full-featured CO-OP.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/82539","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0922/EMjKxGwNpHWy5bJZwm3ZMUuX.png?w=200","MainStory":8,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3717-CUSA29758_00-UNSIGHTED000000E","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi4Fb9c56-Q","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":20,"genre":"Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":113.4,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0922/EMjKxGwNpHWy5bJZwm3ZMUuX.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"UNSIGHTED","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Humble Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-30","Slug":"unsighted-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":189,"MainExtra":11,"SalePrice":113.4,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Hostile alien forces have set their sights on Earth and will stop at nothing to wipe our civilization from existence.

Meet other survivors as you take on a new tier of enemies, discovering both new havens and foreign structures that don\u2019t bode well. ALPINE UNREST A month has passed since the events of the main game, and your search has led you to Himfjäll, an island off the east coast of Östertörn. Formerly a popular vacation spot for its towns, cafés, shops, and ski slopes, the island now stands abandoned. At the massive ski hotel Björntunet, you\u2019ll find something invaluable - a small community of survivors who have managed to stay alive despite chaos outside. Their situation is far from good though, as the enemy is constantly on the lookout, making it next to impossible to leave their hotel hideout. While the situation on Himfjäll is slightly more positive given the addition of new allies, you\u2019ve unfortunately encountered a new tier of machines - Apocalypse Class. Much deadlier than their counterparts you have stumbled upon in the past, they seem designed to hunt down those who are left, overpowering any who try to fight back. Their weapons are horrible creations, including things like biochemical machine guns and flamethrowers. Even the mainland of Östertörn has become more unsafe, as these machines have started making their way there. Hopefully the new machine guns you\u2019ve found during your exploration will be enough to take them down. FNIX RISING The struggle for survival continues as the year 1989 draws to a close. Hope for finding the missing population has started to dwindle, as you and your friends continue to do your best to stay away from the invading machines and scour abandoned buildings for weapons and equipment. However, recent scouting missions that you have conducted on your own and with friends have yielded some unexpected results - structures that appear to be made by the FNIX machines have started appearing along the Southern Coast of mainland Östertörn. Thankfully it seems that there are also survivors, scattered across both the Southern Coast, the Archipelago and Farmland regions, putting up resistance against the invaders. Whatever they are planning can\u2019t be good, and it seems that Apocalypse tier Harvesters have joined their ranks as well, using Biological Aerosol or even Dirty Missiles when you attempt to ambush them. Surviving won\u2019t be easy, but grabbing a brännboll bat or sledgehammer might be a good idea just to ensure that you are prepared for all scenarios, with or without ammo.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1214/8w36CZb4oMUFUFUAfkr7JMUh.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5439-CUSA14212_00-GZSTORYBUNDLE000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Adventure","PlusPrice":41.65,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1214/8w36CZb4oMUFUFUAfkr7JMUh.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Generation Zero® - Story Bundle","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Systemic Reaction AB","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-22","Slug":"generation-zero--story-bundle-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":119,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":47.6,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"This pack includes: Su-7BMK (Rank 6 USSR) Premium account for 15 days 2000 Golden Eagles.

He dreams of the day his sorcery will overtake Shao Kahn's, and he'll pay any price to get there.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202008/2017/gnZe6gUVxzemFWLiP6BqB51a.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1018-PPSA01619_00-SHTCHARACTER0000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Fighting","PlusPrice":17.7,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202008/2017/gnZe6gUVxzemFWLiP6BqB51a.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Shang Tsung","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"WARNER BROS.

Guide your agency through the space race and write your alternate history of space travel - any of the agencies can be the first to land on The Moon if you make the right choices. Manage the numerous challenges faced then and now: \u2022 Create your base with launch pads, research labs, astronaut training facilities, and much more \u2022 Construct your own custom vehicles from hundreds of combinations \u2022 Launch satellites and crewed spacecraft to explore the Solar System \u2022 Run mission control as you solve the various challenges of turn-based missions to earn scientific advancement and public support \u2022 Explore an extensive tech tree and compete or collaborate with other agencies to plot your roadmap to Mars \u2022 Choose from five unique space agencies, each with their own traits, base, vehicles, and spacecraft \u2022 Create your own custom space agency You\u2019re in charge of every element of the journey into space: success rides on your decisions. Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet? Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies? Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars. Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors. Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment. These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue? Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We\u2019ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/85154","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png?w=200","MainStory":12,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5277-CUSA18418_00-0000000000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gqbz8C8bX0","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":92,"genre":"Strategy","PlusPrice":56.76,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Mars Horizon","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"THE IRREGULAR CORPORATION LTD.","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-17","Slug":"mars-horizon-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":172,"MainExtra":34,"SalePrice":56.76,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"This is a clicker game about a mayonnaise jar.

Barely. Take on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.

Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open! Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie.

Getting all games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT\u2019s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem. Immerse yourself in the brutalist, concrete world of SUPERHOT. Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world.

No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets. SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT\u2019s signature power fantasy. You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they\u2019re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched. Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel. You take a moment to consider. You\u2019ve been here before. So many times. Maybe this time it will actually mean something. SUPERHOT VR Decisive winner of dozens of VR Game of the Year awards, SUPERHOT VR is a title reimagined and redesigned from the ground up for VR and hand tracking controllers. The fruit of over three years of close cooperation between the critically acclaimed SUPERHOT Team and Oculus, SUPERHOT VR brings the intensely visceral action of SUPERHOT directly into your head and soul.

You will be one with the system.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2477-CUSA18510_00-7827683902308671","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":190,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"THE COMPLETE SUPERHOT BUNDLE","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Superhot","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-16","Slug":"the-complete-superhot-bundle-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":475,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":190,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Grab your sniper rifle and your silenced pistol and kill all the invading soldiers on the island!

Catch Arapaima that grow up to a huge 450lbs, red tail catfish go to 120lbs and black pacu up to 70lbs. Laguna Iquitos also has 25 new trophy fish and 3 new career events for you to master.

On the road, rescue survivors and choose whether to use them as traveling companions or to improve the Doctor's farm and gain access to new abilities. How your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work. Some survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your ability to fight horrors created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring grid-based positioning and turn-based strategy mechanics.
