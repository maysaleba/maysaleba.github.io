Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats. Each habitat focuses on a key aspect of the growth of your preserves.

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors.

Big Drunk Satanic Massacre is basically a shooter with strong RPG elements - not that rocket propelled gun, though. The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food caf\xe9, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging. The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects. Ever wondered what it\'s like to be Satan\'s son? Nothing special... Unleashed lust, chronic alcoholism and reckless shooting - the usual routine Save Hell! Wait... What? Yup, that\'s right - Hell!

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself! By using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DreamAlone_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dream-alone-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0wF3CM89g","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"80%","genre":"Platformer,Action,Arcade,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"14.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DreamAlone.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"129.95","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/6333/dream-alone-switch","RussiaPrice":"699","Title":"Dream Alone","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"No Gravity Games","ReleaseDate":"2018-06-28","Slug":"dream-alone-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"34.99","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"18.99","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.49","SCORE":"48","SaleEnds":"2022-02-13","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-01-23","description":"When the time of crisis comes and one of your friends is captured, you gotta stand your ground and fight for your partners.

The World Large, procedurally generated and interconnected lands range from plains, to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area\u2019s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items.

Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player\'s score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"8.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"109","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"539","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.14","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-02-12","LowestPrice":"2.49","SaleStarted":"2022-01-28","description":"Skelittle is a silly, colorful party game designed for fun with friends & family.

Eighties of the twentieth century. The golden age of 8-bit video games. We were leaving school, and we were going to spend our precious coins in the arcade machines. One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari\'s Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t want to be better than Asteroids; that\'s impossible. What we want is to make a tribute. And that\'s all we want. We have added some aspects, besides the famous UFO: a demon, and some enemy ships that launch rockets to destroy us. Main features are: Features.

This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character.

But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain\'s lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King\u2019s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices.

Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?<br /><br />If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode!<br /><br />Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you\'ve mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play.<br /><br />You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it\'s close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type.<br /><br />The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it.

So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown!<br /><br />Story<br /><br />A long time ago...<br /><br />In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.<br />The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.<br />...but suddenly something\'s amiss, the town is up in flames,<br />a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.<br /><br />The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.<br />Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.<br />And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.<br />While Arthur\'s back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.<br /><br />In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.<br />To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />Just like its predecessors, Ghosts \'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy!<br /><br />Ghosts \'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You\'ll die, and you\'ll die again, but you\'ll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You\'ll struggle, but you\'ll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts \'n Goblins.<br /><br />In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!<br /><br />In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur\'s inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!<br /><br />Make full use of Arthur\'s weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you\'re going to need it!<br /><br />On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series.<br /><br />Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side.<br />Note: Local co-op only.
