Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\'re part of the stage. The title screen\'s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\'s character explodes into pixels upon death.<br /><br />To survive, you\'ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\'re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />\u2022 Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world!<br />\u2022 Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective.<br />\u2022 Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive.<br />\u2022 Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style.<br />\u2022 Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!","ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Publisher":"EastAsiaSoft","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-09","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1807/7dfibDJZKkgabUv92WYt1h7E.png?w=200","Slug":"paradox-error-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2005-CUSA27948_00-PARADOXERROR0000","platform":"Playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"60%","Price":4.99,"genre":"Action,Platformer","SalePrice":1.99,"PlusPrice":1.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/33222/project-starship-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-07-14 06:59:00","Title":"Project Starship","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-06-29 07:10:48","description":"Take the role of Garret or Gwen, pilots charged with saving their world from an ancient evil.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5\'s hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\'s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON\'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\'ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\'ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You\'ll experience DEATHLOOP\'s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\'ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\'re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\'s stylish sneakers and invade another player\'s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON    <br />Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","ESRBRating":"ESRB Mature 17+","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-14","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","Slug":"deathloop-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA01302_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"PercentOff":"60%","Price":59.99,"genre":"Action,First-Person","SalePrice":23.99,"PlusPrice":23.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"87","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/2136/bayonetta-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-07-21 06:59:00","Title":"Bayonetta","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-07-06 08:11:52","description":"Experience the genesis of the Bayonetta series with the cult classic, original action-adventure game.

Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny.<br /><br />In Evertried, the player\'s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success.<br /><br />You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension!<br /><br />Test Your Strategic Might<br />Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy.<br /><br />Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills<br />Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don\'t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level.<br /><br />Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny<br />The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top.<br /><br />Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses<br />Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.","ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-21","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png?w=200","Slug":"evertried-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4127-CUSA28069_00-EVERTRIEDPS4US00","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImOYOo4RR4","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"40%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Strategy","SalePrice":11.99,"PlusPrice":11.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-07-21 06:59:00","Title":"Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon Classic Edition","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-07-06 08:10:28","description":"Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon Classic Edition is included for free in Far Cry 6 Season Pass.<br /><br />Welcome to an 80s vision of the future taking place on a bizarre open world island crawling with evil, now on the current generation of consoles.

The world has expanded in other ways, too, with branching paths and multi-layered levels adding a third dimension to the classic 2d platforming gameplay.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Mossmouth, LLC","ReleaseDate":"2020-09-15","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0812/K3Rvr0agVdm8ZPgkxIzOfMU6.png?w=200","Slug":"spelunky-2-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4407-CUSA20601_00-SPELUNKY20000000","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EywsqbENxwE","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"55%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Action,Platformer,Multiplayer","SalePrice":8.99,"PlusPrice":8.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"88","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/119304/spiritfarer-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-07-21 06:59:00","Title":"Spiritfarer","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-07-06 08:11:32","description":"Spiritfarer is a cozy management game about dying.

Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it\'s heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.<br /><br />During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands.<br /><br />If you\'re lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.<br /><br />You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode.<br /><br />Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you\'re wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.<br /><br />In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.<br /><br />If you can survive long enough to find it.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"NO MORE ROBOTS","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-30","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/2309/XEozUpmOCdLB940sqK9hCvS5.png?w=200","Slug":"nowhere-prophet-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4256-CUSA19107_00-NOWHEREPROPHETUS","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IadayVADjTw","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"50%","Price":24.99,"genre":"Role-Playing,Strategy","SalePrice":12.49,"PlusPrice":12.49,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"85","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/8254/resident-evil-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-07-21 06:59:00","Title":"Resident Evil","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-07-06 08:14:00","description":"The game that defined the survival-horror genre is back!

Created in close cooperation with the creative teams behind the films, John Wick Hex is fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game, capturing the series\' signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe. Players must make quick decisions and choose every action and attack they make, all the while considering their immediate cost and consequences.<br /><br />Featuring a unique blend of strategic time-based action, John Wick Hex captures the feel of the tactical combat from the films and blurs the line between the strategy and action video game genres. Perform well and progress in the main story mode to unlock new weapons, suit options and locations. Each weapon changes up the tactics you\'ll use and the manner in which you\'ll play. Ammo is finite and realistically simulated, so time your reloads and make the most of weapons you scavenge on the job.<br /><br />Experience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game\'s eponymous villain \'Hex\'. John Wick Hex compliments the style of the films with a unique graphic noir art design and an original score by renowned composer Austin Wintory.","ESRBRating":"ESRB Mature","Publisher":"Gambitious","ReleaseDate":"2020-05-05","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202012/1015/YHfqFdzstoCFuS4136RvMdUO.png?w=200","Slug":"john-wick-hex-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1050-CUSA18381_00-JOHNWICKHPS4SIEA","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nEwjqisgGY","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"65%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Strategy","SalePrice":6.99,"PlusPrice":6.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"70","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/130508/kill-it-with-fire-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-07-21 06:59:00","Title":"Kill It With Fire","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-07-06 08:11:06","description":"The spider - mankind\'s most ancient and deadly nemesis.

The story takes place in the land of Rin during the height of the Age of Sail, following the events that would lead to the greatest war in human history.<br /><br />STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin.<br /><br />POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player\'s party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history.<br /><br />CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character\'s unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle.<br /><br />PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total.

Having devoted his life to running his hotel, he never made time for family or friends. With no obvious heir, he\'s hired you to help him choose the right person to inherit the Bellflower. He narrowed his list of candidates down to a small group of people who have strong personal connections to the hotel, but whom he knows little else about. They\'ve agreed to be interviewed by you under the pretense that you\'re writing a book about the Bellflower Hotel. None of them know what\'s truly at stake. It\'s up to you to get to know these people and determine which of them is most worthy of inheriting the Bellflower. This will be no easy task, as the group contains some unique and memorable characters who will make your decision quite difficult. Be careful though, as there may be more to some than meets the eye.<br /><br />Interview unique and memorable characters through interactive conversations to determine who is best suited to inherit the resort.
