Experience the yet-untold story of Jason and Eve after defeating Earth's mutant scourge as they venture into the depths of space in their new battle tank, \"GAIA-SOPHIA\"! The story of Blaster Master Zero 2 begins a few months after the events of the first game (released on March 9, 2017), where the main protagonist Jason saves planet Earth from the mutants. Eve has been infected by mutant cells that are slowly corrupting her body, so together with Jason and Fred, they board G-SOPHIA and begin an intergalactic journey to Eve's home planet, Sophia, in hopes of finding a cure for the mutant infection. A perfect blend of action-adventure through outer space and the signature Blaster Master gameplay creates a formula for a fun new experience. ●G-SOPHIA's Gaea System is the key to maximum mutant blasting efficiency! The Gaea System converts the energy created by the impact of falling from tall heights or taking damage, then turns that energy into SP. By making good use of the terrain, more and more SP can be recovered, allowing Jason to use more of G-SOPHIA's sub-weapons.

You'll be rewarded for studying the environment and its inhabitants, planning your adventure rather than flying by the seat of your pants. The flora and fauna within the world aren't just fantastical; they're often fatal. Each confrontation, no matter how trivial, has potentially dire consequences.

In the near future on Earth, a young man named Jason Frudnick boards the battle vehicle SOPHIA III and sets off on an adventure in the subterranean depths of the planet. On the side-view maps, take control of SOPHIA III and explore your surroundings as you search for the entrance to the dungeon where the area's boss lurks. Once you find the dungeon entrance, exit SOPHIA III and make your way inside as Jason and take on the mutants inside in top-down mode. Defeat the mid-bosses and area bosses to acquire new items, sub-weapons, upgrades to SOPHIA III and Jason's equipment, and new abilities and move to the next area.

You and your prime mates will be tasked with raising all sorts of quirky constructions on distant planets, by stacking blocks so they fit a given outline. To do so, you will have to team up with other space faring animals and master the use of your trusty apequipment - a banana-fuelled jetpack and a powerful robo-arm. On top of that, you\u2019ll have to utilise the wackiest kinds of blocks (magnets, rockets and even nuclear fusion are no strangers for a well-trained astronaut like yourself), and work in exotic and not-quite-monkey-friendly places. Who said space construction was going to be easy? Monkey around with your friends! Moving heavy blocks is no small feat. Fortunately, up to 4 friends can join forces together to carry this burden (or drop it on each other's heads). Monkey around by yourself Waiting for friends to join you? Don\u2019t worry!

As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning, and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him.

Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you\u2019re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near the South Pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister... Explore the Antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues and unlock secrets, whilst avoiding macabre beings at all cost. Key features: A deep and suspense-filled Lovecraftian story with lots of secrets and Easter eggs.

The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Renovate and decorate train stations and trains. Detailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements. Build your own station. Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time.

In either case, prepare to be unsettled. To your tenants, you are Carl Stein, a government-installed landlord. However, that is simply a facade that hides your real mission: to covertly spy on your tenants.

Inspired by George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Ray Bradbury books, Beholder will challenge your mind and ethics as every choice will have a consequence.

For our hero Skully, the day of his Remembrance is shattered by an invasion from the human kingdom above. However, unlike prior attacks by the humans, they are not seeking gold or other treasure. Instead, they kidnap Aftervale's elder skeleton Elzedon and then go after the magic that kindles the spirits of the dead, the Blue Flame. Without the Blue Flame, there is no Aftervale, no existence beyond death. Together with your best bat friend Imber, you will need to jump, slash and flap your way though the Underworld. It's up to you to stop the humans, save the Elder, protect the Blue Flame and confront Skully's own life before coming to the Aftervale. Features: Versatile and fluid platforming fun for all ages. Visually rich art style. Be a warrior AND a skeleton. Fight the Humans before they plunder your un-life! Meet a unique cast of friendly monsters, undead, and make friends along the way. Play as an adorable bat named Imber, she is the best. Take your time, look for secrets, or even try to speed run, Skelattack is fun for all skill levels\u2026","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Konami Digital Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2020-06-02","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skelattack_image500w.jpg&w=240","Slug":"skelattack-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skelattack-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"80%","Price":"19.99","genre":"Adventure,Platformer,Action","SalePrice":"3.99","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skelattack.jpg"},{"SCORE":"65","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/6245/samurai-defender-ninja-warfare-switch","SaleEnds":"2021-12-01","Title":"Samurai Defender: Ninja Warfare","LowestPrice":"3.99","SaleStarted":"2021-11-24","description":"Samurai Defender: Ninja Warfare is the tower defense game we have all been waiting for!

The choices you face will have a direct impact on the course of the game. They will also define views of your hero. Or maybe those are your views?

Choice in Combat: Decide the fate of two kingdoms as one-armed warrior Jehan. Will he choose to respect the values of his former home by respecting life in all forms? Or will he choose the path of conflict and violence? Before every battle, make the conscious decision to wield a non-lethal stun rod to pacify enemies or a ruthless sword to put them down for good. 2. A Malleable World: Champaner and its inhabitants switch between several states of disdain or acceptance for Jehan. Each playthrough shows only one version of the world as both the town and its inhabitants experience the effects of Jehan\u2019s choices and actions. 3. Interesting AI and Bosses: All NPCs react to the world Jehan shapes. Dialogue options and weapon choice are only two factors in how the AI behaves. Hindsight 20/20\u2019s bosses exhibit emotion, making them more relatable. Nuances in their personality come to light as Jehan continues on his journey. The line between good and evil blurs as they react to Jehan. 4. The Experience Engine: The Experience Engine is a hand-crafted, in-house gameplay engine driven by player choice.

The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. When the game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life. Playable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","Slug":"skittles-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PercentOff":"50%","Price":"5.99","genre":"Sports,Arcade","SalePrice":"2.99","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg"},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-29","Title":"Skelittle: A Giant Party!","LowestPrice":"2.49","SaleStarted":"2021-11-25","description":"Skelittle is a silly, colorful party game designed for fun with friends & family.

Players spread across the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majority control in regions and continents. \u2022 Recruit troops to strengthen your army \u2022 Command your forces to acquire new provinces \u2022 Challenge your friends all over the world \u2022 Sail across the seas & build castles to expand your empire \u2022 Eliminate enemy troops to weaken your adversaries \u2022 Collect goods to increase your advantage[/list] AWARDS & HONORS Our digital adaptation: \u2022 2017 Golden Geek Best Board Game App Nominee \u2022 2017 Golden Geek Best Mobile/Handheld Nominee The board game: \u2022 2013 Golden Geek Best Family Board Game Nominee \u2022 2013 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Nominee \u2022 2014 Gioco dell\u2019Anno Nominee \u2022 2014 Hra roku Nominee Eight-Minute Empire: Complete Edition features all additional content released to date: \u2022 Eight-Minute Empire base game \u2022 Mountains Expansion \u2022 Old Europe Map \u2022 Archipelago of Azra Map \u2022 Southern Plains Map \u2022 Starfall Crater Map \u2022 Isthmus of Gom Map Features: \u2022 official Eight-Minute Empire game \u2022 great artwork \u2022 ingame interactive tutorial \u2022\u2026","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Acram","ReleaseDate":"2019-08-27","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_EightMinuteEmpire_enGB_image500w.jpg&w=240","Slug":"eight-minute-empire-complete-edition-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/eight-minute-empire-complete-edition-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 5 players","PercentOff":"60%","Price":"14.99","genre":"Board Game,Strategy,Multiplayer,Party","SalePrice":"5.99","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_EightMinuteEmpire_enGB.jpg"},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-29","Title":"Ethan: Meteor Hunter","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2021-11-25","description":"Your name is Ethan, a rat that got touched by meteorites giving him the power of telekinesis: freezing time and moving objects around him.

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community. Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes\", which were originally published separately, available now on Nintendo Switch™ for the first time.
