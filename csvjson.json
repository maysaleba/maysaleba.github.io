The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Renovate and decorate train stations and trains. Detailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements. Build your own station. Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time.

At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout. It's a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. When the game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life. Playable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede. The gameplay varies considerably between seasons, vignettes, and moments.","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Whitethorn Digital","ReleaseDate":"2019-10-17","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/w/where-the-bees-make-honey-switch/hero","Slug":"where-the-bees-make-honey-switch","URL":"/games/detail/where-the-bees-make-honey-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"80%","Price":"9.99","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Other","SalePrice":"2","MexPrice":"38"},{"SCORE":"-1","SaleEnds":"2021-11-02","Title":"Werewolf Pinball","LowestPrice":"2","SaleStarted":"2021-10-12","description":"The most entertaining Pinball is back!

With both classic and new game modes, there is something here for both the casual and the hardcore puzzle game player. Gameplay description In Ekstase, shapes of 3-5 blocks fall from the top, and as soon as they hit something, they fall apart. The scan line changes color every cycle and removes the squares you formed with blocks of the same color. Game modes Reach a \"state-of-flow\" in Flow mode Flow mode is the frictionless \"jump in\" game mode in which the game adapts to how you play. Are you getting better? The game will ramp up its difficulty. Are you getting worse? The game becomes easier.
