Though the vehicle has grown old, it has become a cornerstone of your family's legacy. Now, in the blink of an eye, your father's gone. Now, the food truck belongs to you. Will you walk in your father's footsteps and live up to his name? Only one way to find out. You can't take the 'truck' out of 'food truck'. Before you can set your stalls up, you have to actually get from your garage to wherever you decide to vend for the day. Be mindful of traffic, and congestions too! When you feel you're short on time do as your father did and veer off the beaten path. First come, first served! You might've thought that all there is to this business is fast food, but now that you're on the other side of the counter it's time to think again.

Each day is a new adventure, and each adventure requires sufficient provisions. Ingredients aren't permanent and will rot and spoil as the hours tick on by. Remember to stock up on not only the freshest but most desirable produce your clientele might demand of you. The truck is dirty and has fallen to disrepair. Honour dad's memory by polishing it one last time. It's been a while since the truck has seen any use. Grab a bucket and a sponge, find a broom and get to cleaning.

Navigate by boat, discover islands, find new allies to help battle foes, and experience a humorous tale about friendship in this melancholic and atmospheric escape. Rich, Story-Driven Adventure Earth may be flooded, but it\u2019s one heck of a view on the water. With a sense of humor, determination, and some great tunes, Nikos and friends will work together to explore the water-filled environment around them and embark on an adventure to evacuate to Mars and start a new life. 3D Exploration & Discovery Float along the vast waterways freely in your boat and explore the many different islands of a beautiful world where you\u2019ll encounter danger, interact with fellow citizens, gather resources, and fight for a chance to escape to a new life. Turn-Based Combat With A Twist Take on your enemies in a classic turn-based combat system where careful tactics and puzzle solving will help you come out alive. Interact with the environment and items around you: knock down a tree, push a shopping cart into an enemy, or duck behind a turned over car to gain the advantage. Original Radio Tunes The world may be ending, but there's still time to enjoy some good tunes. As you cruise along the water, Highwater Pirate Radio is the key source not only of unique and original music, but also for commentary on your ticket to survival. Amid the Great Climate Catastrophe, the flooded region of Hightower has become a kind of safe zone between the two dry regions: the nearly global ravaged land of the War Zone, and the fortified city of Alphaville, where the ultra-rich live behind giant walls. With life on Earth becoming untenable for humans, and rumors of an escape to Mars floating around, Nikos begins a risky journey, picking up friends along the way. First to Hightower, then beyond to cross the impenetrable border of Alphaville, battling insurgents and stealing food along the way.

Play as Liam or Sophia, the newest member of the Lilygrove Scout Corps, as the young mice find themselves on the journey of a lifetime to save their home from ruthless pirates. Will they reach Redwall and save their friends before all is lost? The Scout Act 1 After months of training, betrothed mice Liam and Sophia are ready to graduate into fully-fledged Scouts: a group of woodland rangers tasked with the protection of the land and trained in the ancient ways of woodcraft. Their initiate ceremonies are cut short when sea rats attack their beloved home. As the senior Scouts rally for battle, it's up to the Scout Corps' newest recruit to outwit the enemy, light the beacon, and summon aid from the surrounding woodlands - before there is nothing left to save. The Scout Act 2 The beacon is lit, troops rally to fend off the invading searats, and Liam reunites with his dear Sophia beneath the Lilygrove Lighthouse, but not all is well. Scumsnout's vengeful cries can be heard in the distance and it is revealed that our Scout's betrothed has been poisoned by the wereat's venomous bite. With no time to spare, the couple race to the Winsome Wraith, where a mysterious and dangerous stoat may have the antidote they seek. As if things weren't bad enough, the sea rats are moving inland and the shadow of a large predatory bird lurks just at the edge of the woods. The Scout: Act 3 After being mortally poisoned by Scumsnout's vicious maw, our young Scouts have made it to the Winsome Wraith in one piece, if just barely. While the mysterious stoat's treatment has bought some precious time, Liam and Sophia must now travel the rest of the way to Redwall Abbey for a more permanent cure. This is the dramatic conclusion of their journey through the murk of Portman's Slough, the miraculously-functioning puzzles of Grating Gulley, and the ancient ruins of the Otters' Den. Features - A brand new original story set the winter before the events of the first book. - A stunning woodland world inhabited by charming critters and villainous vermin. - Two characters with divergent dialog for replayability. - Unique real-time scent mechanic fitting for woodlanders who experience the world primarily through their noses. - An assortment of achievements and collectables for the completionist spirit. - Original soundtrack created especially for fans of Redwall. - Fully voice acted by a talented cast of new and established actors. - Engaging puzzles and side stories for those who delight in world building. Mechanics - \"The Scout\" debuts a dynamic scent system unlike any game before it. Rather than stagnant, pre-designed paths that imitate scent, particles read the wind and the environment to simulate realistic currents and pools. Scents themselves consist of parts and patterns designed around real scent theory. - When traversing the world of Mossflower, you make use of your mouse agility to explore the world in a unique and wondrous way. Shimmy along ledges, scramble sheer cliffs, and even squeeze through impossibly small spaces. With courage, faith, and friends by your side, Mossflower's fate rests in your paws! - Rely on stealth, wit, and agility to evade your enemies. Manipulate dull-witted vermin with scent and scent to avoid getting caught in their grubby paws. - Use your trusty way glass to scope the area and identify danger. Rely on your home-made slingshot to solve puzzles, break pots, and activate traps. - Decide if you will prioritize the mission and leave the others to save themselves or take the time to lend a helping paw. Some may praise philanthropy, still others would praise pragmatism.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202310\/2420\/4ba54ae01e578167c094b2026586777854dccd6aa4c40a40.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP2099-CUSA46220_00-0878668103727367","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Family, Adventure, Action","id":"EP2099-CUSA46220_00-0878668103727367","PlusPrice":179.6,"Title":"The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Forthright Entertainment, LLC","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-10","Slug":"the-lost-legends-of-redwall-the-scout-anthology-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"449.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"269.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"","description":"Borzoi Adventure invites players into a whimsical world where they embody the spirited Borzoi, a graceful canine explorer embarking on an epic journey through enchanting realms brimming with treasures and challenges.

Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon to suit your creatures\u2019 needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won\u2019t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil\u2019s most pleasurable holiday paradise. But what is that noise? \u201CGold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!\u201D The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes.

Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! \u2022 Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. \u2022 New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil\u2019s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. \u2022 Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil\u2019s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil\u2019s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. \u2022 Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. \u2022 Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. \u2022 Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

There ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We\u2019ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What\u2019s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you\u2019d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin\u2019 booze is pure fun, but if you\u2019re makin\u2019 money too - now that\u2019s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You\u2019ll be managing workers who\u2019ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you\u2019ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner. You will progress through main missions, you\u2019ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises... If you\u2019ll be prospering, you\u2019ll get the chance to create and manage bases in five different regions, each with its own, more and more challenging missions. From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there\u2019ll be a pesky agent who\u2019ll want to work with you, and there\u2019ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You\u2019re a free man, after all. That\u2019s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies.

Play co-op online or local and bring the chaos! But if you need some alone time, don't worry, we've got you covered in single player too. Challenging Heists Success brings you bigger and tougher heists to cut your teeth on. Start with a store, move on up to a bank and after that\u2026the sky\u2019s the limit! Literally. Enemies & Hazards No-one said heists were easy. Every chapter is filled with enemies determined to stop your stealing and environmental hazards that will blow your socks clean off. With careful planning, and a lot of bumbling about, you\u2019ll be able to smash and grab with the best of them. Even if you do lose your life, never fear, simply get your team to flush you down the toilet and you\u2019ll be back and fighting fit in no time. Abilities & Power-Ups The deck isn\u2019t stacked against you, each mutant animal has their own special ability letting you explode things, smash up levels, and level the playing field. Bring the chaos and let rip, just take care not to destroy your teammates. Drink soda and eat tacos and other spicy Mexican foods to give you the power you need to smash your way to victory! Weapons & Tools There are loads of ways to beat each level in Filthy Animals so explore everything, grab tools and weapons so you can choose the route that suits you and your gang. Just make sure you choose the right tool for the job, a fire axe can get you through a door but for those pesky guards a shotgun might just be the answer!","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202302\/2017\/b1eaafbdfe910532b768404ee4527921f9f289955401dec1.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP3430-CUSA39286_00-1013068600204742","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Casual, Action, Party","id":"EP3430-CUSA39286_00-1013068600204742","PlusPrice":249.5,"Title":"Filthy Animals | Heist Simulator","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Green Man Gaming Publishing","ReleaseDate":"2023-05-11","Slug":"filthy-animals-heist-simulator-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"499.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"249.50","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"","description":"Prove your drifting skills against the best drivers on DRIFTCE, the brand-new drifting racing simulation game on consoles!

Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades. While most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go. You are one of those people. In-depths Survival Mechanics: Keep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point. Combat and Crime System: How far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are. Winter is Coming: Spend the last few days of autumn wisely \u2013 gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again. Expansive Story: Unlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav. Homeless, But Not Hopeless: Maybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own. You Are Not Alone: Is surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter. Claim the Throne: For over a decade, no one has been able to bring the many factions of the homeless together. The throne of the Homeless King has been sitting empty for far too long. Who will earn enough respect and prove themselves worthy of uniting the homeless? Will you rise to the occasion?","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202205\/1814\/dqyOj6BeMDetJ9RSM8OQOzhw.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP6075-CUSA29679_00-1040084594243406","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP6075-CUSA29679_00-1040084594243406","PlusPrice":377.4,"Title":"Hobo: Tough Life","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Perun Creative s.r.o.","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-22","Slug":"hobo-tough-life-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":46,"SalePrice":"408.85","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"","description":"Steredenn + NeuroVoider + Transcripted = explosions!

Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin\u2019s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind\u2019s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra\u2019s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra\u2019s discoveries as she learns more about her family\u2019s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra\u2019s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player\u2019s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra\u2019s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn\u2019t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE\u2019s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE\u2019s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202301\/0312\/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":16,"genre":"Action, Adventure, Music\/Rhythm","id":"EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","PlusPrice":94.75,"Title":"ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Untold Tales S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-09","Slug":"atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"379.00","MainExtra":5,"SalePrice":"94.75","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"\/game\/106120","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

Endless procedurally generated dungeons, countless monsters, grafting, crafting and a vast amount of skill trees and items allow for unlimited replayability. DELVE INTO THE LORE Evil has been vanquished. Peace has returned to Ancardia, and the peasants dare to dream once more of prosperity. Seven very different factions vie for control over the cataclysmic aftermath left behind by Andor Drakon\u2019s defeat. And somewhere, deep down in an inhospitable cave, ChAoS is stirring again. Pick up your blade, prepare your spells, check your daggers and ready your bow, for you are about to enter the ominous Caverns of Chaos. Choose your allegiance carefully, for you are nothing more than an expendable asset to the masters you choose. Fight for a mercenary's glory and purse, for the justice of a folk in decline, for the light of purity or even for ChAoS itself. Every choice you make will determine how you approach the ever-changing Caverns of Chaos before you. CLASSIC ROGUELIKE VIRTUES MEET MODERN FEATURES Endless procedurally generated dungeons, countless monsters, items and a grand selection of very different skills allow for unlimited replayability.

Over 80 skill trees and dozens of secret skills trees that are only waiting to be unlocked. A stealth system introduces a totally new way of playing the game: Instead of hacking or blasting all opposition to pieces you now can sneak past adversaries and avoid conflict. Turn yourself into an abomination and graft your enemies\u2019 body parts on yourself. They won\u2019t need them anymore, and what's better than wielding two swords? Two swords and an axe to harvest more body parts than ever before. CHALLENGING AND UNCOMPROMISING, YET REWARDING Countless options of how to tackle the dungeons awaiting you.

You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies. Possible alternate history flow - what would have happened if the Allies followed the ideas of Operation Unthinkable and went to war against the USSR in 1946? Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Advanced army manager - choose the composition of your forces. Acquire new units, upgrade or dismiss the outdated ones. Make sure that your forces have all the necessary tools for the upcoming battle. Real WW2 heroes - assign historical personalities to your armies and get access to special skills. Realistic 3D graphics - study the battle map and take advantage of 3D graphics, featuring volumetric terrain and physically-simulated movement of units. Attention to detail - game created by a team passionate about WW2 history.","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202209\/0910\/r28qdLdXatQ9aY1ux0GGRoQl.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP4886-CUSA34476_00-8237173962609670","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy","id":"EP4886-CUSA34476_00-8237173962609670","PlusPrice":374.5,"Title":"Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Klabater","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-22","Slug":"strategic-mind-fight-for-freedom-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"749.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"411.95","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"\/game\/142614","description":"Pacmaga 2 is continuation of successful 2D platformer with main goal ofdefending against waves of enemies and surviving Boss fight!","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202209\/1006\/gVz5cfEOO60Ln6Br8VhqotyN.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP7666-PPSA10223_00-1775673689855679","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Fighting","id":"EP7666-PPSA10223_00-1775673689855679","PlusPrice":18.75,"Title":"Pacmaga 2","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Zakym s. r. o.","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-21","Slug":"pacmaga-2-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"25.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"20.00","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"\/game\/142614","description":"Pacmaga 2 is continuation of successful 2D platformer with main goal ofdefending against waves of enemies and surviving Boss fight!","SaleStarted":"2024-05-07","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202209\/1006\/gVz5cfEOO60Ln6Br8VhqotyN.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP7666-CUSA36785_00-4516163326941569","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Fighting","id":"EP7666-CUSA36785_00-4516163326941569","PlusPrice":18.75,"Title":"Pacmaga 2","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Zakym s. r. o.","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-21","Slug":"pacmaga-2-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"25.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"20.00","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"79","SaleEnds":"2024-05-22","LowestPrice":"\/game\/77865","description":"Welcome to LYNX, the solar system\u2019s leader in spaceship salvaging!

The Galactic Junkers is a comedic action-adventure space combat game that puts you in the role of a space captain on the run. Your ship might be falling apart and your crew isn\u2019t the best but with a little luck you can keep everything ship-shape.

Discover mysterious asteroids, creaking space stations, abandoned shipwrecks, deadly pirates and much more. Mine, Salvage, Steal, and Trade Running a spaceship is never easy and there\u2019s always bills to pay. Keep your bank balance looking healthy by mining asteroids, salvaging derelicts, and trading with disreputable characters. Maybe you\u2019ll even partake in a little theft, but don\u2019t worry - we don\u2019t tell anyone. Battle and Board Enemy Ships Space is a deadly place so you\u2019ll have to fight for your life. Set your crew to operate the guns and show those pesky pirates what you are made of! Board enemy ships to smash and grab essential resources or hack systems from the shadows. Hire and Maintain your Crew A happy ship needs a happy crew, so look after your band of useful idiots. Nurture their skills to keep everything running smoothly, or if you don't like them, show them the airlock and hire new crew. Buy, Upgrade, and Repair Ships Maybe you need a little more juice in the engine department or your guns are falling short. Upgrade your ship to take control of the sector and make a name for yourself. Or if you prefer something a little fancier, trade in your ship for a better model.
