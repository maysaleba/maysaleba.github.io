Rife with dark humor, sarcastic quips, and the absurdity of the system. Seemingly built overnight, The Wall has divided both a country in two and a man from his family. To see them again, our ginger-haired protagonist has decided to become a contestant on \u201cThe Wall Show\u201d, a Regime-organized TV show allowing competitors the opportunity to escape to freedom on the other side. However, as he progresses through the camp, our contestant soon realizes exactly how the Regime and the show operate. The promise of freedom is not exactly what it seems. FEATURES * Cinematic platformer: Run, jump, crash, and climb your way through each Arena as the narrative unfolds around you. Much of the story is unveiled via smoothly integrated animation sequences, within the environment, or from NPCs muttering bits of dialogue as you dive and dodge around them. * Environmental HUD: Rather than having a screen cluttered with overlaid indicators, HP bars, and minimaps, any information the player will need is incorporated into the environment. Hints and clues are meshed into the game\u2019s art, subtle and specific, players will need a keen eye if they want to survive each Arena without breaking their legs. * Puzzle-solving: Use your wits, and at times a dash of ruthlessness, to advance through the Arenas.

The inhabitants of this African apocalyptic world will help or hinder you as you make new discoveries and navigate the spectacular landscape. Negotiate your passage with local leaders, healers and warriors, or find yourself embroiled in a battle against nanite swarms, enormous scorpions and rocket-equipped robots.

DOODLERS Doodlers are peaceful and brave creatures living in Doodland, choose which one you will help to escape. There are no two same Doodlers. Each of them looks different and sounds different, but every one of them has one common feature - digestive problems. BOOSTERS Omnomus has no mercy. If you are on reach, he will eat you without blinking an eye. Fortunately Doodlers can use their gastric problems against him: Just find a match, light your fart and feel the boost. And if this won't help, just release stinky gases in his face to stun him. This is your last resort.","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_EscapeDoodland_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/escape-doodland-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"80%","genre":"Platformer,Action,Arcade,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"1.50","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_EscapeDoodland.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"18","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/6946/escape-doodland-switch","RussiaPrice":"75","Title":"Escape Doodland","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"QubicGames","ReleaseDate":"2018-11-30","Slug":"escape-doodland-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"4.00","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"37.80","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"1.99","SCORE":"65","SaleEnds":"2021-12-15","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2021-12-01","description":"Storm your way through three unique worlds, beat each stage, and destroy the bosses!

The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food café, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging. The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself! By using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DreamAlone_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dream-alone-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"80%","genre":"Platformer,Action,Arcade,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"1.50","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DreamAlone.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"18.00","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/6333/dream-alone-switch","RussiaPrice":"75","Title":"Dream Alone","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"No Gravity Games","ReleaseDate":"2018-06-28","Slug":"dream-alone-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"4.00","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"18.99","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.55","SCORE":"47","SaleEnds":"2021-12-21","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2021-12-10","description":"In the world after the Great War, you will take control of intimidating petrol beasts, each with their own unique weapons and gameplay mechanics.

With no guns, strategy is needed to take on the Yoki close up with traditional weapons such as naginata, magatama and mirror that releases a deadly aura. As you explore the grounds of the mansion you can call up a cursor to examine points of interest and discover items that can aid you in your quest. Kwaidan is a unique blend of action-adventure with classic high-wire suspense from beginning to end that will keep you on your toes. Retro style polygon graphics evoke classic games of the early 2000s, with movie-reel-style presentation. Select between Origin Mode for authentic \"tank-style\" controls, or Modern Mode for standard analog movement and a new subtle cel-shaded look.","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_KwaidanAzumaManorStory_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/kwaidan-azuma-manor-story-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"75%","genre":"Adventure,Action,Fighting,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"9.37","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_KwaidanAzumaManorStory.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"100","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/10062/kwaidan-azuma-manor-story-switch","RussiaPrice":"468","Title":"Kwaidan ～Azuma manor story～","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"RAINYFROG","ReleaseDate":"2020-08-20","Slug":"kwaidan-azuma-manor-story-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"25","ChilePrice":"","Price":"24.99","MexicoPrice":"119.99","SalePrice":"6.24"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.77","SCORE":"-1","SaleEnds":"2021-12-20","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2021-12-02","description":"The world's favorite dungeon crawling Roguelike, Lost Castle is finally here with this impressive Nintendo Switch Edition!

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"4.49","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"54.50","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"269","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"12","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"4.41","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-12-30","LowestPrice":"3.5","SaleStarted":"2021-12-09","description":"SIX SIDES OF THE WORLD \u2013 ALL HAIL THE PUZZLE LORD! \u201cSix Sides of the World\u201d is a puzzle videogame that takes you into an intergalactic journey through different star systems riddled with brain-racking challenges.

The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won\u2019t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King\u2019s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter\u2019s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King.

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!
