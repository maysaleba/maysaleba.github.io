The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality.

Another important feature is the simple \\"level-up\\" system the player can use to improve specific skills, such as the attack rate, the defense, and the special elemental damage.

One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari\'s Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t want to be better than Asteroids; that\'s impossible. What we want is to make a tribute. And that\'s all we want.

But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King.

Barely.<br /><br />Take on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents.<br /><br />You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it\'s heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.<br /><br />During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands.<br /><br />If you\'re lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.<br /><br />You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode.<br /><br />Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you\'re wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.<br /><br />In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.<br /><br />If you can survive long enough to find it.","genre":"Role-Playing,Strategy","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202009/3014/Duaw5GDGGTUKSB17we8CzRfZ.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/7332/stellaris-console-edition--deluxe-edition-playstation","PercentOff":"75%","PlusPrice":14.99,"Price":59.99,"Publisher":"Paradox Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2019-02-26","SCORE":"80","SaleEnds":"2021-10-28 06:59:00","SalePrice":14.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-13 08:10:39","Slug":"stellaris-console-edition--deluxe-edition-playstation","Title":"Stellaris: Console Edition - Deluxe Edition","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4139-CUSA07740_00-STELLARISDDEUS01","description":"Save money on content for this game by purchasing the Season Pass.

Your pizza\'s here!\' You announce. No one answers. There\'s an eerie silence.<br /><br />You are getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the door and look around. The front door suddenly closes behind you.<br /><br />You just wanted to finish this last delivery and head home for the night. Now you must figure out how to get out of this stupid creepy house.<br /><br />Freely roam the house and try to figure out what is going on. Three dolls and a strange girl named Emily will also start roaming the house as the hours toll by. Stay away from them, but if you do end up in a room with one, figure out how to stay alive.<br /><br />This may be your last pizza delivery.<br /><br />(c) 2016 SKH Apps LLC All Rights Reserved","genre":"Action","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP0994/CUSA12205_00/5YiLgnyvzjcAY6xyzQxBiavsX8LdDcXC.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/3536/halloween-forever-playstation","PercentOff":"45%","PlusPrice":5.49,"Price":9.99,"Publisher":"POPPY WORKS.","ReleaseDate":"2018-10-22","SCORE":"75","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":5.49,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 07:11:09","Slug":"halloween-forever-playstation","Title":"Halloween Forever","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0994-CUSA12205_00-HALLOWEENFOREVNA","description":"Adventure through three weird, spooky worlds in search of your destiny.

Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages.<br /><br />The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible.<br /><br />Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.<br /><br />As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.<br /><br />A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game\'s atmosphere.","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307J23gLIGDXjcPQkNP_BIOzsJkH2aXIu15z_wiyX5Q2jAIPwjcec4P7kCbPo7PR1vyK9uwTJONCj9s8-nkqWLMIsn_89T.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/spookys-jump-scare-mansion-hd-renovation-playstation","PercentOff":"33%","PlusPrice":6.69,"Price":9.99,"Publisher":"ALBINO MOOSE GAMES","ReleaseDate":"2019-10-29","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":6.69,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 08:10:40","Slug":"spookys-jump-scare-mansion-hd-renovation-playstation","Title":"Spooky\'s Jump Scare Mansion: HD Renovation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4388-CUSA10521_00-0000000000000000","description":"Can you survive 1000 rooms of cute terror?

You\'ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn\'t even bear imagining.<br /><br />Storyline<br />This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\'ll soon wish you could join the dead\'s ranks in their abyss, but death won\'t help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows?<br /><br />Dark entities<br />The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\'ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own.<br /><br />Gameplay<br />In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You\'ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it.<br /><br />Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you\'ll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Teen","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307TQRuBkpEMNOSz7zNpepxSnIwkP0iamqNnaacfTfBj7kFSUyAe-ROlMIOT8n7IMm9wjySg0gTBeQ--gWxbG3Mssn8pXS.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/waltz-of-the-wizard-extended-edition-playstation","PercentOff":"60%","PlusPrice":3.99,"Price":9.99,"Publisher":"Aldin Dynamics, ehf.","ReleaseDate":"2019-08-27","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-04 06:59:00","SalePrice":3.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-20 07:10:53","Slug":"waltz-of-the-wizard-extended-edition-playstation","Title":"Waltz of the Wizard: Extended Edition","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1452-CUSA16931_00-WOTWEE2019PSVR01","description":"Waltz of the Wizard is a virtual reality experience that lets you feel what it is like to have magical powers.

Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction.<br />Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons.<br />Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race.<br /><br />Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war.<br />Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.<br /><br />Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene!<br />Every corner of the game\'s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games.<br /><br />Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal.

Plunge into an atmospheric open world, teeming with life: from the majestic true-to-life animals to the rustling of leaves above you as you stalk your prey. You can decide to hunt on your own or join up and hunt together with friends. Just remember, you are not just a visitor in this world, you are a living and breathing part of it. As you finally spot the majestic crown of your first red deer through the brush, the feeling is indescribable.<br /><br />EXPLORE RESERVES ACROSS THE WORLD<br />In the 2021 Edition, you will be able to visit hunting grounds across the globe. Trek through the lavender fields of Parque Fernando, explore the lush snow covered landscape of Yukon Valley, traverse the regal foliage of Cuatro Colinas, or scale past the cloudline in the mountainous Silver Ridge Peaks. In these diverse reserves, you will be able to hunt animals of all shapes and sizes, from grizzly bears and wolves to turkeys, bighorn sheep, ibexes, and pumas. And that only scratches the surface of what these 4 regions have to offer.<br /><br />BRING THE PERFECT EQUIPMENT<br />When tracking your target, you need to bring the best possible equipment for the task, and 2021 Edition has you covered. Including 5 weapon and equipment packs, you will be able to prepare yourself for any hunting situation. Bring the drilling rifle along for versatility, the MN1890 or M1 for reliability, or the Muzzleloader for that old-time explosive shot. Or if you want to set up the perfect hiding spot to take down your target, utilize the treestands and tripods for maximum visibility.<br /><br />SHOWCASING YOUR TROPHIES<br />What better way to celebrate a successful hunt than showcasing your trophies in one of the two lodges included in the 2021 Edition. Decorate the walls and rooms in both the spacious 1800 British Mansion and more modern safari lodge with your prized kills, creating a visual representation and journey of your best hunting moments. Or simply use the multi trophy mounts to pose multiple animals and create a visually climactic moment involving your favourite trophies. Invite your friends to your lodge at any time and share your evolving collection.","genre":"Simulation,Sports","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202008/2016/RT32qXrpX8XPelxRpIRO42dd.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/10249/transformers-battlegrounds-playstation","PercentOff":"60%","PlusPrice":15.99,"Price":39.99,"Publisher":"Outright Games LLC","ReleaseDate":"2020-10-23","SCORE":"68","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":15.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:33","Slug":"transformers-battlegrounds-playstation","Title":"Transformers: Battlegrounds","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3824-CUSA17596_00-TRANSFOBASEGAME0","description":"With Earth under invasion and MEGATRON, leader of the Decepticons close to capturing The Allspark, BUMBLEBEE and the Autobots need a new commander to help them restore peace to the universe \u2013 you!<br /><br />Assemble your squad and roll out, for a turn-based tactical war that will rage from Central City to Cybertron itself.

When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?<br /><br />If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode!<br /><br />Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you\'ve mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play.<br /><br />You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it\'s close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type.<br /><br />The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it. Get your name up there and challenge your friends!<br /><br />The only question that remains is: what\'s outside the room?<br /><br />PlayStation\xa0VR headset compatible<br />PlayStation\xa0Camera compatible<br />Enhanced play with 2 PlayStation\xa0Move motion controllers<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled","genre":"","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202104/0210/o03fnVnzmBMW2v62ov49x5fw.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/breathedge-playstation","PercentOff":"40%","PlusPrice":14.99,"Price":24.99,"Publisher":"HYPETRAIN DIGITAL LTD","ReleaseDate":"2021-04-06","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-11 07:59:00","SalePrice":14.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:17","Slug":"breathedge-playstation","Title":"Breathedge","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4416-CUSA26770_00-5029723546049722","description":"Survive in outer space!

Revealing the restless events of Site 113 and its struggle to construct the generator before the freezing veil shrouds the Earth, this prequel expansion broadens the Frostpunk universe by introducing a new environment, new Books of Laws and unique technologies, and presents a range of new buildings \u2014 all of which let you shape society and the city in unconventional ways.<br />\u2022 On The Edge expansion tells a story of citizens of New London sent for a special assignment after the Great Storm.

In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive.<br />Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler\'s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and the present state.<br />What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?","genre":"Simulation,Strategy","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-playstation","PercentOff":"33%","PlusPrice":20.09,"Price":29.99,"Publisher":"Capcom U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-31","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":20.09,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:13","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-playstation","Title":"Ghosts \'n Goblins Resurrection","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA24159_00-MAKAIRE000000001","description":"Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes.<br /><br />Taking cues from both Ghosts \'n Goblins and Ghouls \'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name.<br /><br />Don\'t be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown!<br /><br />Story<br /><br />A long time ago...<br /><br />In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.<br />The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.<br />...but suddenly something\'s amiss, the town is up in flames,<br />a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.<br /><br />The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.<br />Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.<br />And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.<br />While Arthur\'s back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.<br /><br />In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.<br />To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />Just like its predecessors, Ghosts \'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy!<br /><br />Ghosts \'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You\'ll die, and you\'ll die again, but you\'ll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You\'ll struggle, but you\'ll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts \'n Goblins.<br /><br />In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!<br /><br />In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur\'s inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!<br /><br />Make full use of Arthur\'s weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you\'re going to need it!<br /><br />On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series.<br /><br />Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side.<br />Note: Local co-op only.

Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.<br /><br />The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.<br /><br />What\'s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\'ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.<br /><br />They don\'t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\'ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\'t happen but marketing text is hard to write.","genre":"Action,Platformer","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"ESRB E10-T","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/UP4491/CUSA01037_00/murHNPj3G2JBa7CXX3Uup8qiD5d3BFwQ.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/surgeon-simulator-ae--i-am-bread-playstation","PercentOff":"80%","PlusPrice":3.99,"Price":19.99,"Publisher":"BOSSA STUDIOS LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2016-04-26","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":3.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:11:48","Slug":"surgeon-simulator-ae--i-am-bread-playstation","Title":"Surgeon Simulator A&E + I Am Bread","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4491-CUSA01037_00-SSBREAD000000001","description":"2 unique games linked by a shared universe and distinctive humour!

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike.<br /><br />There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series.<br /><br />This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians.<br /><br />Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields.<br /><br />It\'s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive \u2013 lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment.<br /><br />Tannenberg\'s Maneuver game mode captures the essence of warfare on the Eastern Front, with 40 players, large open maps, and the freedom to choose which sectors you will attack and defend. Just make sure you don\'t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies!<br /><br />The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front). These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines.<br /><br />We recreate the atmosphere of the Eastern Front with the same level of accuracy as seen in Verdun. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references. The maps use realistic props and terrain layouts based on locations from the hilly forests of Galicia to a Polish village subjected to scorched earth tactics.<br /><br />This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content.<br />Gore and blood can be disabled completely with an in-game setting.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.","genre":"Action,First-Person","platform":"Playstation"},{"ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202106/1613/a1eXEcc7kQdiuQDsUYfDhq2k.png?w=200","IsPS4":1,"IsPS5":0,"LowestPrice":"8388607","MexPrice":"","NumberofPlayers":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/-1/the-crew-2-gold-edition-playstation","PercentOff":"80%","PlusPrice":17.99,"Price":89.99,"Publisher":"Ubisoft Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2021-07-07","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-20 07:59:00","SalePrice":17.99,"SaleStarted":"2021-10-27 08:10:09","Slug":"the-crew-2-gold-edition-playstation","Title":"The Crew 2 Gold Edition","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-CUSA08600_00-TC2GOLD200000000","description":"The Crew 2 Gold Edition includes: <br />- Season Pass <br />- Digital Special Pack, which includes:<br />* DODGE CHALLENGER SRT DEMON Interception Unit<br />* PORSCHE 911 SPEEDSTER <br />The Motorsports Deluxe Pack which includes:<br />* FORD F-150 RAPTOR RACE TRUCK 2017<br />* ABARTH 500 2008 MONSTER TRUCK EDITION<br />* PILATUS PC-21<br />* 3 outfits to customize your avatar<br /><br />JOIN A COMMUNITY OF 30 MILLION PLAYERS!
