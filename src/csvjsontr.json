The Big Boss Bundle brings thrilling DLC to Hotshot Racing for free! New mode Barrel Barrage delivers the most incendiary action yet, while the Boss Level Grand Prix introduces an expanded selection of rapid racetracks. Hotshot Racing is a blisteringly fast arcade-style racing game fusing drift handling, razor-sharp retro visuals and an incredible sense of speed to create an exhilarating driving experience. Developed by racing game veterans SUMO Nottingham and Lucky Mountain Games, Hotshot Racing is an all-new driving experience which revives the classic arcade gameplay of the 90s and thrusts it into the modern era. 16 racing circuits provide the twists, turns and straights conducive to searingly quick racing. Take in coastal, jungle, alpine and Las Vegas desert environments, with each course modelled with the most vivid colours and blue skies for miles. Time Trial and Grand Prix modes cater to those who like to compete in classic racing formats, while ‘Cops and Robbers’ and ‘Drive or Explode’ modes offer exhilarating new ways to play. Each mode is available in single-player, four-player split-screen and eight-player online, while Time Trial is single-player only.

As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn’t feel right and he plans his escape. “El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Using the shadows to his advantage is the core element of the game, as “El Hijo” will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to increase the challenge.

Rich, Story-Driven Adventure Earth may be flooded, but it’s one heck of a view on the water. With a sense of humor, determination, and some great tunes, Nikos and friends will work together to explore the water-filled environment around them and embark on an adventure to evacuate to Mars and start a new life. 3D Exploration & Discovery Float along the vast waterways freely in your boat and explore the many different islands of a beautiful world where you’ll encounter danger, interact with fellow citizens, gather resources, and fight for a chance to escape to a new life.

Just the one we knew. Enter the Days of Doom, a post-apocalyptic tactical RPG roguelite that challenges players to reach Sanctuary, a place of promise and respite in a world of colorful chaos. Starting with a small cast of survivors, you’ll chart a path to reach your ultimate destination, encountering threats, including zombies, raiders, and even zombie raiders! Along the way you will need to recruit a ragtag band of heroes to protect your growing community and fight your way forward. Discovering how to best utilize each hero's unique abilities is the key to success in Days of Doom’s turn-based combat. Attack with Pyro early in the battle, as he ignites enemies for lasting damage. Then combine the Hydromancer and the Thrasher in a one-two knockout punch. Hydromancer can set the stage with a ranged water attack, and then the Thrasher can deliver a shocking surprise to wet enemies. The odds against you may seem insurmountable, but if you use your heroes' abilities strategically, upgrade them, and add new abilities along the way, you might just make it. No two runs are ever the same, which keeps you at the top of your game, and makes Days of Doom inherently replayable.

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike. There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series. This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians. Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields. It’s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive – lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Just make sure you don’t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies! The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front), with a new game Isonzo coming soon with mountain warfare on the Italian Front! These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines.

The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man’s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn’t for the faint hearted! Looking for more WW1 action? Check out Tannenberg for Eastern Front maneuver warfare, or the upcoming Isonzo for Italian mountain warfare!","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202012/0822/DTzPcBOwcSWWl5HrVa1d8jYE.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1662-PPSA02758_00-1206800080748220","MainStory":15,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Shooter, Shooter","id":"EP1662-PPSA02758_00-1206800080748220","PlusPrice":124.75,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/verdun/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Popularity":"","Title":"Verdun","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BlackMill Games B.V.","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-15","Slug":"verdun-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"499.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"124.75","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"56","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"/game/91442","description":"Just Die Already is an old people mayhem sandbox game created by the designers of Goat Simulator.

Play the Comics Developed by Upstream Arcade, Hellboy Web of Wyrd utilizes an art style faithful to Mike Mignola’s original masterpieces.

Will you walk in your father's footsteps and live up to his name? Only one way to find out. You can't take the 'truck' out of 'food truck'.

Remember to stock up on not only the freshest but most desirable produce your clientele might demand of you. The truck is dirty and has fallen to disrepair. Honour dad's memory by polishing it one last time. It's been a while since the truck has seen any use. Grab a bucket and a sponge, find a broom and get to cleaning.

Looking for answers, you explore your environment and fragments of memories. On your journey you are repeatedly confronted with riddling tasks, driven by the desire to find out what's going on. What happened last night? Why can't you think of any other thing aside from your days as a stage builder at the circus? As things get crazier and more bizarre, the lines between reality, memory, and imagination become more and more blurred and you realize: there is no going back. You have to do whatever it takes to bring this story to an end, no matter at what cost... \"The feeling of safety is an elusive one. It's not over yet.\" SETTING In REVEIL, the player is immersed into a world, designed with attention to detail, where the boundaries between reality and illusion become blurred. The setting is an authentically orchestrated environment inspired by the circus of the 60s, which soon takes on surreal features. Get a glimpse into the psyche and the past of Walter Thompson: The impressions become darker, more mysterious, more enigmatic the further you advance. Once caught in the maelstrom of deceptive impressions, memory fragments and mysterious visions, your only option is to dive deeper - in the hope of finding answers to your perplexing situation and condition, even if this hope is slowly fading. The only thing that keeps you from giving up is the will to find Martha and Dorie. Do not shut your eyes to the hints left by the two, but keep them wide open and ... try to not lose your mind.

As you play, you'll feel yourself reaching for your dice and miniatures. It's time to dive into the world of Solasta! Roll for initiative, take attacks of opportunity, manage player location and the verticality of the battle field. Set yourself up for the finishing strike and possibly roll a natural 20 at that key moment of a battle. In Solasta, you take control of four heroes, each with unique skills that complement one another. Every hero expresses themselves in the adventure, making each action and dialogue choice a dynamic part of the story. Players will create their heroes just as they would in a pen-and-paper game by choosing their race, class, personality, and rolling for their stats. You make the choices, dice decide your destiny. An Epic Team Adventure Discover the shattered world of Solasta. Explore ruins and dungeons for legendary treasures, learn the truth of an age-old cataclysm—and stop it from happening again. Create your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. Tailor your squad to your preferred strategy and maximize your party's abilities. The choice is yours. Online Multiplayer Co-op Play any campaign with up to 4 players for more fun and shenanigans! The best part? The host shares all their DLC with the other players! Time to fireball some friends. Discover a Mysterious & Dynamic World Delve into long-forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. Fight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over—on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground. Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. Size also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though—the monsters are also thinking vertically. Custom Campaigns In Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the official campaign is over. Download and play new Custom Campaigns with friends, made by the community with a push of a button! From the room layout, monster composition, and treasure the party will find, down to the decoration and lighting of each room or the music track playing—everything is handcrafted with love and care.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0816/adcba6a68e07cdb12b1a1dd453cb29a6ad6a6a368464a899.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5789-PPSA17744_00-0141723598888133","MainStory":40,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":67,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP5789-PPSA17744_00-0141723598888133","PlusPrice":224.7,"Popularity":"","Title":"Solasta: Crown of the Magister","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TACTICAL ADVENTURES","ReleaseDate":"2024-03-06","Slug":"solasta-crown-of-the-magister-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"749.00","MainExtra":46,"SalePrice":"299.60","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"","description":"Grab your torches and jump into the World of Solasta with the Lightbringers Edition!

In Farm Tycoon you can have more than 20 different crops that you can cultivate by hand or using machines, where each harvest has a precise expiration date. Before you plant your seedlings, first remember about the proper preparation of the land for cultivation.

Not For Broadcast VR takes the gameplay, story, and gripping dark comedy of the original award-winning FMV adventure and brings you closer to the news than ever. Get a full view of the entire newsroom, interact with your equipment and punch, slap and grab anything that dares to get between you and the truth. We promise it’s so immersive you’ll feel like you’re really being electrocuted by your poorly maintained equipment! Egotistical celebrities, dishonest politicians, and strange sponsors clash on the airwaves. You’re in the chair to ensure that the show goes on uninterrupted.

Hand-pick the headlines… with your ACTUAL hands! Experience the lost art of inserting a VHS tape into a deck through the magic of virtual reality. Carefully position your “air-conditioning” so the news doesn’t overheat and turn spin wildly around your desk during the adverts (watch the cables, though). Plus, shake your fist in rage at whatever political ideology you don’t agree with (Or at everyone, it’s OK, they can’t see you). Frame the picture; frame the debate Keep the general public entertained with your editing skills, and keep an eye on those ratings. Make politicians look greedy or brave, make resistance leaders look noble or violent, and make news anchors look charming or unhinged. Who and what you decide to show on screen might change the course of history. No pressure. Keep it PG If VR was invented for anything, it was the simulation of pushing important-looking red buttons. Smash it (or gently tap it; it’ll work fine either way) to keep rude words (and other sensitive information) off the air. Keep the news safe for children and oppressive political regimes alike. Tune out the chaos, load up the ads, crank up the volume and immerse yourself in the dreams, fears, hopes and neurosis of an entire nation, all while sitting on your floor.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/2109/bb4ffdb077e6352c3af40a553e17db31b97e201c4617cb81.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-PPSA08716_00-9490505870769070","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adult, Simulation, Casual","id":"EP0096-PPSA08716_00-9490505870769070","PlusPrice":345.95,"Popularity":"","Title":"Not For Broadcast: VR","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"tinyBuild LLC","ReleaseDate":"2023-12-14","Slug":"not-for-broadcast-vr-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"377.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"/game/122411","description":"The chickens have escaped!

Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise. But what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart. Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilnessâ„¢.

Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! • Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. • New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. • Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. • Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. • Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. • Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

Players take control of Lyn Graves, the precocious niece of legendary treasure hunter Zachary Graves. Lyn visits her uncle’s mansion with her closest compatriots, only to find the house overrun with ghouls and monsters who quickly grab and spirit away her friends. In order to free her uncle and her friends, and capture all the supernatural foes, Lyn must find the shattered pieces of a magical urn and put them back together. Through procedurally generated room layouts, shifting walls, unpredictable enemy placements, and unique ghostly encounters, Lyn must creep, sneak, and dash her way through hordes of ghouls and eerie ectoplasms in order to locate her friends and uncle. Each urn shard is fiercely guarded by a bone-chilling boss — with 3D isometric stealth gameplay, Lyn must think on her feet to conquer each challenge. When she gets knocked out by a shadowy specter, she winds up back at the Haunted House’s entrance and must face an entirely new floor layout and enemy placement, ensuring each run is unique. Key Features: Resurrected Roguelite: Randomized elements, ensure no two runs are the same. All-Ages Thrill Ride: The whimsical, cartoonish art style only thinly veils the chills and thrills in Haunted House!

Starting with a small cast of survivors, you’ll chart a path to reach your ultimate destination, encountering threats, including zombies, raiders, and even zombie raiders! Along the way you will need to recruit a ragtag band of heroes to protect your growing community and fight your way forward. Discovering how to best utilize each hero's unique abilities is the key to success in Days of Doom’s turn-based combat. Attack with Pyro early in the battle, as he ignites enemies for lasting damage.

The odds against you may seem insurmountable, but if you use your heroes' abilities strategically, upgrade them, and add new abilities along the way, you might just make it.

While Kotora takes her studies seriously, Usada has her head in the clouds. She wanders over to a bookshed deep inside, returning with a big, thick book. \"I found this interesting-looking book!\" Kotora looks back at her quizzically. Suddenly, a slip of paper falls out from the book. The letter reads: \"Find Alice.\" As soon as they read the words, the two are enveloped in a blinding light. When they come to, they're in a grassy field that they've never seen before. At that moment, a white rabbit comes hopping along. He might know how to get back to their own world! The pair take their first steps into the world of this magical book, in order to go searching for the white rabbit... Alice Escaped! is an exploratory 2D action Metroidvania. Follow the adventures of Usada and Kotora, who have wandered into a strange wonderland of grimoires and must chase after a mysterious girl named Alice in order to return to their own world. What awaits them in this mysterious world are strange yet familiar characters, such as Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, and Humpty Dumpty. Are they friends or foes? And why does the white rabbit Usamura have a zipper on his back? And who exactly is this enigmatic girl hiding Alice in the deepest part of the world? This is where you've probably realized that this game has multiple endings. There are numerous major choices to be made, a story that repeats itself, and the true goals of the characters to be revealed. An adventure the likes of which you've never experienced before is about to begin! â–  Battle Action One of the core points of this game is its stylish, tag-team battle system! Swing Usada’s giant hammer to pulverize your enemies with powerful melee attacks, or use Kotora’s submachine gun and bombs to take out enemies from a distance. Switch between the two to chain impressive combos! Chaining combos will increase their attack power, and make it easier to quickly defeat your many oncoming enemies. Taking out enemies builds up your Chance Gauge, which can be used to perform supporting attacks and devastating ultimate attacks. (Feature not included in the demo.) The intensity builds in boss fights: whittle down their Shield Gauge to break their shields, letting you unleash a flurry of attacks. But beware: they've got a variety of powerful attacks to hit you back with! â–  Our heroines learn and grow When you collect the skill crystals that drop all over the world, you can improve your characters' skills. You can improve their weapons, which will then unlock unique skills. Or you can focus on their stats and movement, and even pick up skills to help them convince others to help them. If you find yourself stuck on a difficult boss, then try taking some time away from the main path to help our heroes grow stronger. Scattered about here and there in the world are death matches (areas where you can't proceed without defeating all of the enemies there), and if you can finish them with a high-count combo, or without taking any damage, you can earn skill crystal fragments. In addition, out in the world you can also find Heart Crystals, which increase your heroes' maximum health, in addition to other key items that they'll need on their adventure. Based on what you find, you might find that they're protected by powerful traps, just like the treasure you'd find deep inside of a cave. Go explore any way you wish in the world of Alice in Wonderland!","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/1820/f41253f41480d5c0a2e1dafd651b1915afe01ac0126acd96.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0734-CUSA43414_00-0922380785609695","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":12,"genre":"Action","id":"EP0734-CUSA43414_00-0922380785609695","PlusPrice":299.4,"Popularity":"","Title":"Alice Escaped!","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SEKAI PROJECT, INC","ReleaseDate":"2023-08-24","Slug":"alice-escaped!-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"499.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"349.30","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"","description":"Sniper Elite 5 Complete Edition includes the base game, Season Pass One, and Season Pass Two.

Would-be marijuana moguls will need to prioritize resources carefully as they manage the production and distribution of their weed. Cultivate killer plants, cross-breed them to create unique strains of the devil’s lettuce, hire and manage a growing staff, and be prepared to take on the competition. As in real life, the business of bud presents plenty of opportunity along with a plethora of problems. Decide when and where to take on extra risk to maximize profit, but be careful, the cops and politicians are all working their own angles. An important, controversial topic presented in an insightful and detailed manner, Weedcraft Inc presents a challenge to those who would rule the reefer, offering a series of diverse scenarios and unique characters to work with (or around) as your budding empire grows. Whether you choose to hobnob with politicians, pay off the police, fight for medical marijuana rights or work the legal system, it’s all in the name of the sticky icky and your cutthroat corporate profits. Deluxe Edition comes with almost two hours of chilled beats straight from Weedcraft Inc, grinded and rolled by some of the top Polish hip hop producers. --- BEGIN WITH PASSION FOR MOONSHINE We love moonshin’. There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught!

Bring your friends into the frontier in your own private server, or make new friends (and enemies) in large public multiplayer servers. Play peacefully in co-op, or use the dynamic multiplayer faction system to band together and split apart dynamically as allegiances change. Build ships from scratch and travel to new planets Your first planet is where you’ll learn to survive, but that’s just the start. Build your very own starship and use it to colonise new worlds. It won’t be easy, and only the most successful colonies will be able to pool the resources and knowledge necessary to break orbit. Once you launch, the stars hold brand-new planets, new biomes, bosses and challenges. Craft, research, loot and exploit your environment You’ll need to prepare to take on this hostile part of the galaxy. Get mining, farming, growing, developing, researching, and building hundreds of different items, from winter combat gear to advanced laboratories. Find something you can’t work out for yourself. Strap on your handcrafted laser rifle and venture out into the unknown to explore dungeons, procedural bases, NPC stores and much more. Defend what you’ve built, or take on the galaxy Defend your colony with fast-paced combat that utilizes physics like bullet drop, projectile speed and spread. Thwart enemy raids on your base with your stock of handcrafted grenades. Tired of just defending? Lay waste to enemy bases with destructible terrain as you wield everything from rusty old carbines to nuke launchers and energy weapons that harness the power of lightning! Develop and construct advanced bases for protection Grow from a tiny outpost into an advanced, nuclear-powered fortress. Manage resources carefully and choose research paths based on the items and challenges you encounter on each planet. Watch out, though: the bigger your colony gets, the more of a target it becomes for raiders (and jealous friends). Automate work and train up a team Even out here, you’re not alone. Save AI survivors and build a colony together. A range of unique stats, perks and flaws mean every colonist has something different to contribute. As your AI colonists complete tasks they’ll level up and get smarter, stronger and faster. Best of all, you can assign tasks and orders to NPCs to do the grunt work for you and prioritize their roles based on those skills. Want to take a break from mining to destroy an underground alien nest? Let your colonists handle that for you! And Remember Your ship may be in ruins, your ammunition running low, and your teammates scattered across the surface, but remember this: You’re more than just another adventurous spirit. You’re a Farworld Pioneer.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202307/2411/012099a6712612b2484a81e41a52f849b5443060a681acfa.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-PPSA13377_00-0134071212675868","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure, Simulation, Action","id":"EP0096-PPSA13377_00-0134071212675868","PlusPrice":170.55,"Popularity":"","Title":"Farworld Pioneers","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"tinyBuild LLC","ReleaseDate":"2023-08-15","Slug":"farworld-pioneers-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"379.00","MainExtra":28,"SalePrice":"189.50","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"/game/92848","description":"Black Skylands is the first steampunk experience that combines elements of open world, sandbox, top-down shooter, and adventure games.

Walk the same, but now neon, streets as you're thrown into an adventure filled with hilarity, 80’s nostalgia and punching. Even more punching than before. Become A Champion Fighter Punch, kick and cheat your way through, if you want. Becoming the best damn fighter aint easy, it takes time, dedication, dollars and training! Increase your stats and techniques, plan your match and create your own incredibly awesome school of fighting! Sounds better than losing and everyone laughing at you. Whilst nothing beats good old fashioned blood, sweat and tears, neuro training and illegal software sure sound tempting. Even if there is a slight risk you’ll be exposed as a fraud and your last brain cell will pack up and leave. Manage…Everything Life in the rat race is fast paced, time consuming and requires effective management to survive, Punch Club 2 is the same! It’s literally a simulation game! Manage your time and funds, whilst climbing to the top of the fighting leagues, solving crimes, working for the police, mob, mafia and about anyone else you cross paths with. Completing quests will give you access to new fighting schools, moves, dollars, good person points and even the Lion Queen on VHS! The first rule of Punch Club, is tell everyone about Punch Club, wishlist it now or prepare to fight (for legal reasons, we won’t actually fight you).","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202307/1311/23a3a6f753944f876a236831198cbea53c771e9eea432ded.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-PPSA15371_00-0913919440006596","MainStory":18,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":20,"genre":"Sport, Role Playing Games, Simulation","id":"EP0096-PPSA15371_00-0913919440006596","PlusPrice":274.45,"Popularity":"","Title":"Punch Club 2: Fast Forward","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"tinyBuild LLC","ReleaseDate":"2023-07-20","Slug":"punch-club-2-fast-forward-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"499.00","MainExtra":20,"SalePrice":"299.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"","description":"Contains 3 educative games.

The Chimera, hybrid warriors born of the union of two souls, are the only ones who can protect humankind. Briar and Lute are two sisters who have been reborn as Chimera. The transformation has granted Briar superhuman strength and resilience, while Lute, sacrificed to bind her soul to her sister’s, has become a shade with mystical powers.

In your role as Visioneer, every aspect of creating, managing, and designing successful amusement parks will be under your control. CREATE THE PARKS OF YOUR DREAMS As creative lead of the park, you can let your imagination off the leash! Build wild loops and hoops for a coaster like no other to attract thrill-seeking teens, research exciting flat rides to appeal to adults, or pop down cheery, adorable flat rides for families. But, you can also take things to the next level with unbelievable modules that add unique pizazz to your park. Going even further, you can adapt the entire world to your imagination by using terraforming tools to raise mighty mountains for your coasters to summit or whip up custom ride scenery using the modular building system that can be grouped, saved, and duplicated for quick and easy creativity! MANAGE AND OPTIMIZE FOR SUCCESS As a park manager, you’ll discover how to cater to your audiences and perfect your ride placement, prices, and shops to appeal to each audience. Guests will need to be supported by a specialized staff that you’ll hire and direct. You’ll also get to decide if you want your park to stay within the more grounded and realistic side of the theme park world or leave those limits behind in search of profits! Gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of visitor enjoyment using powerful heatmap tools that will let you precisely tweak their experience to your benefit.

It costs 1 energy unit to shrink or to grow. This creates an entire new style of puzzle design in which you must determine when it's most beneficial to change sizes in your route planning. Micro Challenge features the ability for the Tile to become \"micro\" but it is ALSO a \"micro\" sized Tilting Tiles game. Micro Challenge is designed to be a perfect starting point for the franchise. It features 20 unique levels and 5 creative multiplayer maps!

Again and again you shoot, battling more strange beasts; all grotesque mutations of creatures you once knew. Suddenly the inexplicable becomes clear. Time channels have formed in the Earth's atmosphere, turning once normal life forms into something they were never meant to be. As part of a special commando unit, you must not only ward off and eradicate the beasts, but destroy the time channels to finally rid the Earth of these deadly mutations.

Build it your way! • Multi-tiered and challenging simulation Playing as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands. • Extensive local traffic simulation Managing traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more. • Districts and policies Be more than just another city hall official! Create a car-free downtown area, assign free public transport to your waterfront, or ban pets in suburbia. Designate parts of your city as a district in order to set policy at the local level, and give different parts of town their own personalities. • After Dark expansion included Watch your city become an entirely different place at night: a day-night cycle will have your citizens seeking out places to unwind after work.

Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":14,"genre":"Action, Adventure, Music/Rhythm","id":"EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","PlusPrice":75.8,"Popularity":"","Title":"ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Untold Tales S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-09","Slug":"atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"379.00","MainExtra":5,"SalePrice":"75.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"/game/106120","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game.

DELVE INTO THE LORE Evil has been vanquished. Peace has returned to Ancardia, and the peasants dare to dream once more of prosperity. Seven very different factions vie for control over the cataclysmic aftermath left behind by Andor Drakon’s defeat. And somewhere, deep down in an inhospitable cave, ChAoS is stirring again. Pick up your blade, prepare your spells, check your daggers and ready your bow, for you are about to enter the ominous Caverns of Chaos. Choose your allegiance carefully, for you are nothing more than an expendable asset to the masters you choose. Fight for a mercenary's glory and purse, for the justice of a folk in decline, for the light of purity or even for ChAoS itself.

Colorful pixel art aesthetics: each tree, bush or rock is hand-drawn, each enemy has dozens of carefully crafted animation frames to create a one-of-a-kind visual experience; Mind-bending science fiction story: Several multidimensional versions of Earth were suddenly merged together, shattering one another in a cataclysmic event known as the Great Shift.

Combine his powerful melee and ranged attacks to vanquish your enemies. Heal carefully so that foes don’t steal your remedy, use movement, various buffs, and debuffs to gain the advantage and defeat your rivals; Customizable hero: implant different organs into the body of your Herald to acquire unique combat enhancers and passive abilities. Gather and equip nodes and runes to make your Herald godlike.

The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game making it the definitive version on consoles of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience. Man Meets Magic & Machine In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return… Key Features A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters. A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into. Command Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in. Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems.

Each choice you make in the crucial few moments we all know may change our lives for good in a split of a second, influence what kind of person Mitch turns out to be and what values shall guide him once he becomes his own man. Why Are You Who You Are? Find clues as to why Louise’s life is what it is today, take crucial decisions no other person would be strong enough to stomach and show Mitch what he needs to see in order for him to become independent, suave and brave enough to conquer the day. Everything Has Consequences Your decisions REALLY matter! To keep track of Mitch’s growth as a person, each choice you make adds positive or negative points to three key statistics: Righteousness, Confidence, and Relations. These influence which type of ending Mitch will reach at the end of the game - there are 9 unique endings in total! Everybody Has Their Story The 1960s were tumultuous in more ways than one - the Summer of Love, the Vietnam War, the survivors and the losers of the great upheaval in history. Canned Heat was “Going Up the Country” while Bob Dylan asked “How does it feel” to have no home and live on the street. Travel across the country and meet a plethora of characters that may help or may dissuade Louise from her goals - including the most controversial groups many thought long gone. Best Month Ever!

It'll Be The Best Month Ever! is a complete collection of 29 beautiful, expressive, folk, country and jazz-inspired melodies prepared by the composer JÄ™drzej BÄ…czyk (Pan JÄ™dras).

The Complete Edition consists of a full version of the base game, The Little Ones DLC and all three narrative-driven scenarios, each showing a different perspective of war. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle.

At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During a war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival.

And if this wasn't enough, it’s time to get wet again with his newest adventure, Leisure Suit Larry - Wet Dreams Dry Twice. Because, Larry's not done yet and he's still dreaming of you. He left New Lost Wages, stranded in Cancum, and had prepared to marry his only true love, Faith. But, unforeseen events interrupted them and they’ve become separated again! She is somewhere in the famous, sunny and huge Kalau’a archipelago and he has to find her. Help him — if he doesn’t find her soon, he may burst!","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/0814/1WYtKpomcsFaDUrZR0RUcdfW.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5470-CUSA25517_00-0825325166455351","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"90%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP5470-CUSA25517_00-0825325166455351","PlusPrice":162.9,"Popularity":"","Title":"Leisure Suit Larry - Wet Dreams Saga","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Assemble Entertainment GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2022-02-28","Slug":"leisure-suit-larry-wet-dreams-saga-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"1629.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"162.90","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"","description":"Saint Patricks Day Break 2 is an arcade game that lets the user break Saint Patricks Day themed items with a unique Clover paddle and ball.

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naivetÃ© of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCOFROGWARESUAK","MainStory":13,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":29,"genre":"Adventure, Action","id":"EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCOFROGWARESUAK","PlusPrice":225.8,"Popularity":"","Title":"Sherlock Holmes Chapter One","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-15","Slug":"sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1129.00","MainExtra":21,"SalePrice":"225.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"","description":"Christmas Break 2 Head to Head is a retro arcade game that lets 1 and 2 players play head to head in a competitive arcade environment.

Frostpunk Season Pass - a set of three expansions of the Frostpunk universe: • The Last Autumn is a turning point in the Frostpunk universe. Revealing the restless events of Site 113 and its struggle to construct the generator before the freezing veil shrouds the Earth, this prequel expansion broadens the Frostpunk universe by introducing a new environment, new Books of Laws and unique technologies, and presents a range of new buildings — all of which let you shape society and the city in unconventional ways. • On The Edge expansion tells a story of citizens of New London sent for a special assignment after the Great Storm. It not only opens a brand new chapter set in the Frostpunk universe but also pits you against new challenges and offers unique mechanics, both in the city and on the Frostland map - further enriching the core experience. • The Rifts allows you to experience a new level of challenge on a brand new Endless Mode map, where the land itself threatens your survival. Using a new gameplay mechanic, bridge the rifts to access new areas. Expand the city to save your people from the inevitable doom! ABOUT THE GAME Frostpunk is a blend of city-builder, society survival and a strategy game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and the present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202107/1311/4N4eGyrwGerDc9krtKnthKRN.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKCOMPLET","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"85%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Strategy, Simulation","id":"EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKCOMPLET","PlusPrice":169.35,"Popularity":"","Title":"Frostpunk: Complete Collection","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"11 Bit Studios S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2021-07-20","Slug":"frostpunk-complete-collection-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"1129.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"169.35","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"","description":"Pizza Break is an arcade game that lets the user knock out Pizza themed items with a unique Pizza Box paddle and pizza slice ball.

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity’s last line of defense.

The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2520-CUSA23292_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"88%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP2520-CUSA23292_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","PlusPrice":53.88,"Popularity":"","Title":"Disjunction - Digital Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-27","Slug":"disjunction-digital-deluxe-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"449.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"53.88","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-07-03","LowestPrice":"","description":"The Avatar Full Game Theme Bundle Space Break includes the Space Break Full Game, 2 free Space Break Dynamic Themes and 10 free Space Break Avatars for one low price.

Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance. Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before! NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them! EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...) There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor.

Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open! Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don't worry though, you won't be alone!

In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle.
