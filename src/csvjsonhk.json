Enter a labyrinth that moves as you move, where mastering the elements is key to defeating enemies and uncovering the mysteries of this underground world. With a new experience awaiting every time you enter the dungeon, let the power bestowed by the crown guide you in this challenging adventure! Procedurally Generated Maze The procedurally-generated maze ensures you have a different experience every time you enter the dungeon.

Take however long you need to map out your route, decide the best way to avoid traps, or how to use the elements to your advantage. A carefully thought out strategy is the key to escaping this dungeon alive. Use the Environment As you go deeper into the dungeon you will come across terrains mirroring a variety of elements that can be combined with your skills to deal heavy damage to the enemy. Throw fire on top of oil to burn monsters and mix lightning with water to electrocute your foes. There are a lot of lethal combinations to explore and use to slay monsters you encounter. Learn Skills from your Enemy Throughout your quest, you will encounter elite monsters, equipped with elite skills, known as Familiars. By defeating them you will gain access to their abilities, increasing your arsenal of skills you can unleash as you continue on to the next levels.

Experience the new online mode with weekly challenges and leaderboards. In Solo mode, you can now deal with incidents (injuries, illnesses) during the 92 stages available. BECOME A LEGEND In Tour de France 2022, you can create your own cyclist in Pro Leader mode. Choose your profile (climber, sprinter, puncher or versatile) and become a future winner of the Grande Boucle or a specialist of the great classics! Take control of a team in Pro Team mode! You start at the lowest levels and must prove yourself to receive invitations from organizers to high-profile races. Create your own tour with My Tour mode and the 92 stages available. Choose teams, rest days and stages to build your own unique tour. NEW FEATURES - New online mode with leaderboard - Race incidents (falls, illnesses\u2026) - New preparation system - New interface on cobbled sections - More intense races with a more aggressive peloton and more collaborative breakaways - All 21 official stages of the Tour de France 2022 - New \"\"Primavera Classic\"\" inspired by a major Italian race - 3 new teams: Eolo-Kometa Cycling Team, Caja Rural-Seguros RGA and Uno-X Pro Cycling Team- NEW ONLINE MODE: RACE OF THE WEEK Enjoy a new challenge each week, competing against players from all over the world as you try to reach the top of the leaderboard! The controllable team and objectives \u2013 e.g. win the overall classification, score more points in mountain stages \u2013 differ based on the race. NEW: RACE INCIDENTS You can now choose to enable or disable race incidents and their consequences. If you enable them (for yourself and your opponents or just your opponents), you can choose their frequency and enable or disable their consequences, which vary depending on the incident's severity: loss of power for a short or long duration, or even withdrawal. Be prepared to adapt because your strategy might need to be completely re-evaluated at any moment. NEW: RACE PREPARATION To add more unpredictability to races, a new preparation system has been added. Five random cyclists (from your team or in the peloton) will be especially well prepared for the race and five others may potentially underperform. Unfortunately, you can't know who these cyclists will be\u2026 You will need to keep an eye on all your opponents. OTHER IMPROVEMENTS To make the cobbled sections of races more immersive, we have added shuddering to the entire user interface. This new feature reflects the difficulty of cobbled sections. You have never experienced the Arenberg trench quite like this! In Tour de France 2022, the races are more intense than ever, with even bigger early breakaways and better collaboration in all breakaways. You will need to adapt your strategy accordingly!","SaleStarted":"2022-09-27","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202204/1509/v8sC3bO3hwhM164YQUWE3ngc.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/EP6665-PPSA06479_00-TDF2200000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Simulation, Sport","PlusPrice":234,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202204/1509/v8sC3bO3hwhM164YQUWE3ngc.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/tour-de-france-2022","Title":"Tour de France 2022 (English)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-09","Slug":"tour-de-france-2022-english-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":468,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":234,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"68","SaleEnds":"2022-10-12","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

Save the Tetras and make the most out of their special abilities. Via the means of shape-shifting, Tetras can turn into different Tetrominos and are used to fill holes and master puzzles, in an attempt to reach the portal on the other side of the level. But, don't just expect a linear adventure, as sometimes crafting a staircase to heaven is the only way to make it to the end. If you dare to dream big and go block mad, you might just have what it takes to bring all the Tetras back home!

Recruit a company of up to three mortal heroes and guide them in spirit on a desperate journey from Albion to Jerusalem. Explore a richly-imagined medieval setting on the brink of apocalypse. Trade with merchants, improve your heroes and unearth ancient relics. Search for the lost fragments of your soul, scattered across the multiverse - and save as many worlds as you can. KEY FEATURES: A Roguelike Experience Carve a path across the lands of Albion, Marca Hispanica and Al-Andalus. Will you take a dangerous route, risking life and limb in pursuit of a legendary relic? Or will you choose a safer path? Plan and prepare. Negotiate, barter, fight. Tackle challenges. Suffer losses. Recruit new Heroes. Earn Gold, Supplies and Renown. Be careful: your choices are permanent, as is death. But don't tarry - evil never rests. Tactical Turn-Based Combat Master the tactics of squad-based and turn-based combat to conquer both human and demonic foes. Your enemies will be tough and ruthless; make use of high ground and cover, set up ambushes and coordinated attacks, harness synergies between different Hero classes and skills. Non-Linear Narrative Enjoy a compelling story inspired by Arthurian legend, the Matter of France, and the history of Al-Andalus - with an unusual twist. Make choices in interactive encounters that change every time you play. Written by Jonas Kyratzes (The Talos Principle, Serious Sam 4) and Verena Kyratzes (The Lands of Dream, Serious Sam 4). Hard Mode Suited for only the bravest adventurers. Experience an even greater challenge with complex resource management and tougher enemies. Earn Essence with each run that can be exchanged for Blessings and Curses, adding temporary benefits and burden in equal measure to your next run. Dynamic Leveling Use Renown to level up your Heroes, and choose between a randomized set of new skills or improved attributes. But choose wisely! Select skills with great synergy and balance your party for the road ahead. Equipment Upgrades Seek out towns to improve your arms and armor, or stumble upon hermit artisans in the wild. With every day that passes, the world plunges deeper into darkness, and you will need all the equipment gold can buy. Relics From a peasant's humble luck charm to the legendary sword wielded by Arthur himself, items imbued with magical power are scattered about the world. Some you will be able to purchase from merchants and collectors, but others will have to be earned through acts of heroism - or displays of wit. Spells Rain thunder and brimstone upon your foes! Seek out and gather Soulstones to restore your power and unlock new Spells. Even if defeated, your spirit will retain all of your collected arcane knowledge as you jump into the next dimension. Alternate Dimensions As you jump from one parallel dimension to the next, history is reshaped. Different kings rule the land, changing the encounters, characters, and events. No two worlds are ever quite the same, and each journey will be unique. And should your heroes fall, remember: defeat is not the end, only a new beginning. There are as many worlds as there are stars in the sky. In each stands Camelot; in each there is a Grail. But there is only one Merlin, and his eternal burden is to stand against the horror from beyond. Each world that is saved is saved forever; each world that is lost is lost for good.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-27","LowestPrice":"/game/92277","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png?w=200","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/EP0131-PPSA04468_00-THEHANDMERLINPS5","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":119,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1218/zpWC0WzPwfXksuANFSwVVMsv.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Hand of Merlin (English)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"VERSUS EVIL","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-14","Slug":"the-hand-of-merlin-english-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":238,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":119,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-10-12","description":"Final Vendetta is a hard-hitting action packed beat \u2018em up for 1 or 2 players in the vein of classic arcade titles.

Dalis Rhyme, a meteorological scientist, who devoted his life to studying the north, was hardened not only by the cold. As a young man, by a twist of fate, he found himself in the far North. He fell in love with this region and decided to settle down to explore it. In a small fishing village Dalis found his future wife, and together they built a research station and raised their daughter. Even Crossout didn\u2019t affect their lives much and didn\u2019t disconnect them from science, forcing them only to be more concerned about provisions. But during one of their expeditions, Dalis and his wife ventured very far into the permafrost territory. They decided to spend the night in a cave at the foot of a giant mountain range, where they stumbled upon indescribable organic specimens that were unknown to science. After that, Dalis lost consciousness. He came to his senses in the middle of a snowy forest. Having returned home and not finding his wife and daughter there, the man went searching to the only place where he had seen people in recent years \u2014 the Valley.

The legendary mercenary Wolfhound has stopped contacting his customers a long time ago. Of course, many thought that the Valley had ruined him, but in fact it was a man who tried to do so. Which is not surprising, considering how many enemies a hired killer can have. One night, when Wolfhound arrived at a routine meeting with his client, the mercenary was ambushed. The abandoned plant, where the meeting was supposed to take place, was turned into a pile of rubble and dust, but the vigilantes could not find Wolfhound\u2019s body in it. They couldn\u2019t find his car either. The mercenary\u2019s enemies celebrated their victory and went on with their lives, forgetting about Wolfhound like a bad dream. But a few years later, one of the vigilantes fell into a familiar snare, and seconds later all that was left of his armored car was a flaming pile of metal. One by one, those who had once tried to destroy the mercenary began to die under similar circumstances, and all of them met the same unfortunate end. Wolfhound has returned, but he stopped killing for money. Now all those who had once used his services started to die. The rumors about the emergence of a terrifying ghost named Barghest started to spread around the Valley. People just couldn\u2019t believe that the mercenary could have survived that attempt on his life, and decided that he had really become a ghost. A far more dangerous and terrifying ghost than Wolfhound himself had been. The unique armoured car presented in the pack is known for its balance of weapons, combination of modules and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the \u201cPacks\u201d tab, select the desired armoured car and click the \u201cAssemble\u201d button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases to 55. Attention! Storage overflow is possible under certain conditions. Buying the pack also gives early access to several structural parts. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy. Unique portraits provide an excellent opportunity to stand out among the survivors. Paint cans are a way to make your armored car different from the pack. Coins \u2014 is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention! When buying multiple packs, the acquired coins stack!","SaleStarted":"2022-09-27","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2112/seAGJJ0JuFb978ziSiYuap7Z.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/EP4432-CUSA06859_00-EB00870000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Simulation, Unique","PlusPrice":199,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2112/seAGJJ0JuFb978ziSiYuap7Z.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Crossout \u2013 Barghest (English Ver.)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"Gaijin Distribution KFT","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-25","Slug":"crossout--barghest-english-ver-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":398,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":199,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-10-12","description":"Bassmaster® Fishing 2022, the official video game is OUT NOW, bringing the thrill of competitive big bass fishing to PS4, PS5.

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You\u2019re the only human there, after all.

Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™\u2019s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings.

In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals.

Save your friends. Time is ticking. Alma is an Automaton that awakens to a world in ruin after the war with the humans. Anima, the resource that gives Automatons sentience, is running out and turning Alma\u2019s friends into mindless killing machines, the UNSIGHTED. Key Features: EXPLORE YOUR WAY - The world of Arcadia is massive and ripe for exploration, with many shortcuts to discover and maps both above and below the surface of the world. When one path seems too tricky, find new uses for familiar weapons and tools. RICH AND VARIED COMBAT - Build your perfect loadout to suit your playstyle. UNSIGHTED allows players to equip weapons in various ways, from dual-wielding swords to shuriken and shotgun combinations. Alma will need to use perfectly timed combat actions to trigger faster reload speeds or a massively damaging parry to survive in the city. CRAFT AND UPGRADE - Upgrade Alma through an extensive upgrade tree via chips you\u2019ll find throughout your journey. Chips can be crafted or discovered, and each offers different bonus effects. Experiment with nearly limitless builds from the fast and efficient to the powerful and stylish. CHOICES MATTER - Alma\u2019s withering life force ticks away in real-time and is the driving factor in the story of UNSIGHTED. Tarry too long in one spot, and you may find that critical NPCs have already become Unsighted before you meet them. Save or drain other Automatons of their anima for your survival. The constant passage of time can result in vastly different endings and allows for further playthroughs to stay fresh and exciting. HIGHLY REPLAYABLE + CO-OP - In addition to the main story UNSIGHTED also features additional challenge modes, BOSS RUSH and DUNGEON RAID.

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality. In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes.

Days Gone Digital Deluxe Edition includes: - Days Gone Digital Full Game - Digital Original Music - Days Gone Digital Mini-Art Book* by Dark Horse Comics - Days Gone PS4™ Dynamic Theme - Monkey Wrench Skill Early Unlock - 3 Bike Skins *The art book contains spoilers to the Days Gone story mode. We here at Bend Studio recommend playing through the story mode before viewing the art book. Days Gone is an open-world action-adventure game set in a harsh wilderness two years after a devastating global pandemic. Play as Deacon St. John, a drifter and bounty hunter who rides the broken road, fighting to survive while searching for a reason to live. \u2022Harsh Open World: Using the power of PlayStation®4 and Unreal Engine 4, Days Gone offers an incredibly realistic and detailed open-world experience. Immerse yourself in vast and hostile environments, and explore their secrets. Search abandoned vehicles, houses, truck stops and towns as you scavenge for resources. But be careful\u2014 day and night cycles, along with dynamic weather systems, all affect gameplay and enemy behavior. \u2022Brutal Sandbox Combat: Perfect your gameplay with an endless combination of strategy and play in every situation. Craft customized items using pieces and parts found in the field, from brutal melee weapons to traps and more. Act wisely, as every choice can be the difference between life and death. \u2022Unique Enemies: In addition to human drifters, marauders and militia, Deacon must face a wilderness overrun by Freakers\u2014 mindless, feral creatures. Although more animal than human, Freakers are smart and quickly evolving. As with any living creature, they have needs, habits, and behaviors that Deacon must learn and adjust to. \u2022Unique Setting: Adapt to quick environmental changes inspired by the harsh high-desert of the Pacific Northwest. One minute, Deacon is riding through a dense alpine forest\u2014or snow field or lush meadow\u2014 and the next, he\u2019s fighting his way through harsh desert lava fields and caves.

Welcome to Call of Duty®: Ghosts, an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty® franchise features a fresh dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty universe, the franchise's ambitious new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Ten years after a devastating mass event, the nation's borders and the balance of global power have been redrawn forever. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as 'Ghosts' leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power.
