Embark on this definitive version of the critically acclaimed Shin Megami Tensei V, massively expanded with a brand-new storyline featuring new locations, demons, and choices to make that will dictate the fate of all existence. Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance consists of two complete story paths: experience a brand-new route, the \"Canon of Vengeance\" – a dramatic tale of revenge by the fallen, centered around new characters and an enigmatic cohort of demons, the QadiÅ¡tu, who plot their own dark designs apart from the war of those who fight to maintain order and those who seek to defy it. Or explore the original story told in Shin Megami Tensei V, the \"Canon of Creation\" – an eternal conflict between angels and demons, in which the protagonist fights for the world’s fate. When a grisly murder scene in modern-day Tokyo blocks our protagonist’s walk home, an unplanned detour leaves him buried and unconscious. He awakens in a new Tokyo, a wasteland ravaged by apocalypse now called Da’at… but before bloodthirsty demons can claim his life, a savior emerges, and the two of them unite to become a mighty being, neither human nor demon: a Nahobino. With newfound power, the protagonist ventures through Da'at, an enigmatic realm filled with mythical deities and demonic tyrants in constant conflict for survival. Searching for answers, the protagonist must forge his own path in a battle between angels and demons to dictate the fate of the world. KEY FEATURES The Definitive Version of Shin Megami Tensei V Fully evolved with stunning visuals for modern consoles, the dark lore, unnerving atmosphere, and beautiful and monstrous demons are back and better than ever. Massively expanded with new areas, demons, and music, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance features more accessible gameplay, an improved battle system, new demon experiences, and greater field exploration. A Tale of Vengeance or Creation Which path will you choose? Experience a brand-new tale of revenge by the fallen or the original story of Shin Megami Tensei V, both filled with conflicting and tragic choices, forcing you to confront which ideologies you are willing to fight for. As order and chaos crumble around you, forge your own path to dictate the fate of humanity. Explore a Post-Apocalyptic World Battle through a decimated Tokyo, reduced to an expansive wasteland and overrun by mythical demons. Roam across wide, open areas and explore new locations for life-saving items or encounter hundreds of familiar demons and dozens of new ones to battle or befriend as allies.

Crusade through dungeons, slay heretics, build your cult, and seek new powers together. But there’s more. As well as the addition of co-op play, the Unholy Alliance expansion also adds new tarot cards, relics, buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and other secrets to discover!

It tells the story of a young nun who sets off on a journey of self-discovery with the most unusual, horn-headed companion by her side. On the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance—as she speaks with the devil himself. Indika’s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery. The world she discovers can only be described as a wild combination of comedy and tragedy straight out of the novels by Dostoyevski and Bulhakov. ENJOY AN INDIE GAME WHERE EVERYTHING GOES The subjects of religion and authority are prevalent throughout Indika’s journey and she’ll be faced with many questions along the way. Guide her to find the answers one by one before she can finish her life-defining odyssey. Odd Meter is a small, independent studio formerly based in Moscow and now operating out of Kazakhstan. Its members put aesthetics at the forefront and aren’t afraid to tread the fine line of ethical norms.

Play as the #2 best investigator as you find clues, question silly suspects, and look at things through your magnifying glass. Some nay-sayers have called the magnifying glass \"useless\", but what do they know? In Case 1, The Haunted Island, a sloth has been haunted for weeks by a mysterious ghost that nobody can seem to track down. Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective. In the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbor has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbor is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer. In the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all... This final mystery is jam-packed with twists and turns, a true love letter to the Frog Detective fans. Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery is a family-friendly yet witty take on the detective game genre. Solve the mysteries on your own, or play along with friends as you take turns reading out the dialogue. Think you can crack the case?

The Big Boss Bundle brings thrilling DLC to Hotshot Racing for free! New mode Barrel Barrage delivers the most incendiary action yet, while the Boss Level Grand Prix introduces an expanded selection of rapid racetracks. Hotshot Racing is a blisteringly fast arcade-style racing game fusing drift handling, razor-sharp retro visuals and an incredible sense of speed to create an exhilarating driving experience. Developed by racing game veterans SUMO Nottingham and Lucky Mountain Games, Hotshot Racing is an all-new driving experience which revives the classic arcade gameplay of the 90s and thrusts it into the modern era. 16 racing circuits provide the twists, turns and straights conducive to searingly quick racing. Take in coastal, jungle, alpine and Las Vegas desert environments, with each course modelled with the most vivid colours and blue skies for miles. Time Trial and Grand Prix modes cater to those who like to compete in classic racing formats, while ‘Cops and Robbers’ and ‘Drive or Explode’ modes offer exhilarating new ways to play. Each mode is available in single-player, four-player split-screen and eight-player online, while Time Trial is single-player only. Single-player modes run at a blistering 60FPS to deliver one of the fastest depictions of racing possible. Smash lap records to rise-up the global online leaderboards or download ghost laps to match your racing lines against the very best. MEET THE HOTSHOTS Keiko, Xing, Mike, Alexa, Aston, Toshiro, Marcus and Viktor - eight speed addicts that have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of being the greatest racing driver in the world. A WELL NEEDED BOOST Earn boost by drifting and slipstreaming opponents and unleash a one-shot hit of speed to leave them in your rear view mirror. CATCH THE DRIFT Drifting is crucial in Hotshot Racing. Boost charges as the player drifts so maintaining it for as long as possible is vital to preserving maximum speed throughout a race. DRIVE OR EXPLODE In this mode each car has a bomb attached to it. Drop below a certain speed and BOOM! The trigger speed gets faster and faster, forcing players to maintain impossibly high speeds. COPS AND ROBBERS Robbers evade the cops. Cops catch the robbers, and in doing so convert them to the police side, leading to an exciting test of skill for the surviving criminals.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1116/8oLdhsOuqG5AYSiT3bxQ4bpk.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4395-CUSA11573_00-0000000000000001","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Driving/Racing","id":"EP4395-CUSA11573_00-0000000000000001","PlusPrice":0,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/hotshot-racing","Popularity":"","Title":"Hotshot Racing","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Curve Digital","ReleaseDate":"2020-08-12","Slug":"hotshot-racing-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"139.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"77","SaleEnds":"2025-03-05","LowestPrice":"","description":"Hue is a vibrant, award-winning puzzle adventure, where you alter the world by changing its background colour.

You’re here to test our newest, state-of-the-art military-grade color-technology: The ChromaGun (patent pending)! Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You’re the perfect candidate for our test chambers!

Arcade Mode: Survive as long as you can against progressively dangerous enemies until you’re out of lives. Challenge Mode: 25 hand-crafted levels with unique challenges such as defeating a certain number of enemies within a period of time, each designed to make you think of new strategies to conquer them.

Defeat waves of enemies using your ship to circle around them and create a punishing deadzone.

Accelerate to make some distance between you and a stalking Neutron and use your dodge to avoid the Quarks’ deadly laser attacks. With two modes of play, you can chase for high scores in both the endless arcade mode or 25 curated levels designed to push your reflexes to the limits. And, of course, it wouldn’t be a Recharged title without some new beats from Megan McDuffee. Hear the music build in real time as your combo multiplier grows higher and higher. Try not to get hit! Arcade Mode: Survive as long as you can against progressively dangerous enemies until you’re out of lives.

His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn’t feel right and he plans his escape. “El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child.

That’s right – we’re doing this again. The baa has been raised, and Pilgor is joined by other goats too. You can invite up to three friends in local or online co-op, create carnage as a team, or compete in mini-games and then not be friends anymore. Get ready for another round of udder mayhem. Lick, headbutt, and ruin your way through a brand new open world in the biggest waste of your time since Goat Simulator! We won’t tell you how to play (except in the tutorial), but merely provide the means to be the goats of your dreams. KEY FEATURES: - You can be a goat - Three of your friends can be goats too, and join you in local or online co-op - No really, there are so many goats. If you want to be fancy you can wear the skins of tall goats, stripey goats, and many more. There’s a goat for everyone! - Or dress up your goat in all kinds of nonsense, from toilet rolls to tea trays. Put on a jetpack for all we care - This time we actually hired ‘game designers’ and we’re told they’ve added ‘an ok amount of content’; events, NPCs to mess with, physics, status effects, collectables, easter eggs, lies, betrayal, heartbreak - They’ve added mini-games too, lots of mini-games (seven is a lot, right?) - Who said anything about a musical? - You can be Keanu Ree...

Unleash scores of unique weapons and set off incredible chain reactions of fire, napalm, and limbs in the name of freedom.

Bro-Op & Deathmatch: Battle terrorism with up to four players in cooperative mode or sever ties with your bros and face each other in several bombastic competitive modes. Fully Destructible Everything: Destructible terrain opens up a slew of strategic options while the abundance of Exploding Red Barrels of Justice™ can literally level the playing field with one shot. *** Broforce Forever Update *** Broforce Forever, the long-awaited free update to 2015’s most patriotic video game, held back from freedom-loving gamers for a crime it didn’t commit, has promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade and unleashes a megaton of Kentucky-fried carnage into the face of evil. The final update offers an improved and expanded campaign with new unlocks, along with six new ultra patriotic bros, four new democracy-spreading challenge levels, and the ultimate expression of military might – bug fixes! The best way for a returning player to enjoy this is to play through the entire campaign again. And again. Forever. NEW BROS Harness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Seth Brondle, wield Xebro’s flying Chakram, serenade (and grenade) terrorism with the flamenco firebrand Desperabro, or become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer!

Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice. NEW CHALLENGES Bros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards.

We invite you to join us on a journey into madness, where each encounter could be your last. With each step you take closer to unravelling Derceto's mystery, the eyes that watch from the darkness grow hungrier. Every bullet means the difference between survival and an unthinkable end. The next door you unlock could lead to a nightmarish realm offering nothing but slashing claws, grasping tentacles, and frayed sanity. Journey to interbellum Louisiana, where an era of decadence hides a darker tale - of escape from past traumas and an intolerant society, into the waiting grasp of something darker, something that has patiently lurked for impossible eons. This is Alone in the Dark as you've never seen it - a skillfully-woven narrative of Southern Gothic elegance and eldritch madness that pays homage to its legendary origins while taking the next step forward in survival horror storytelling. A Haunting Tale of Mystery and Madness Step inside Derceto Manor, an asylum shrouded in intrigue, guarding a terrible secret. Client Emily Hartwood and private investigator Edward Carnby embark on a harrowing quest for answers; Emily to the mystery of her missing uncle, Edward to the toughest case he will ever face, and both to questions they dare not ask themselves. This re-envisioned classic invites you to explore an unforgettable single player adventure rich with suspense, frights, and revelations that will test the limits of your imagination. Featuring Hollywood Talent Experience some of the greatest acting survival horror has ever seen through the performances of award-winning actors Jodie Comer (Killing Eve, Free Guy) and David Harbour (Stranger Things, Black Widow) in their first videogame roles. Jodie and David’s immaculately captured likenesses breathe life into Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby, lending a deeply personal aspect to Alone in the Dark’s story that demands it be played twice to get the full experience. A Tribute to Horror Pioneers Rediscover the essence of psychological horror in a game that respectfully nods to its 1992 origin, the game that established the survival horror genre. Alone in the Dark is your gateway to an experience steeped in the atmospheric dread of classic horror, with next-generation storytelling and gameplay. A must-play for fans of twisted tales, nerve-wracking exploration, and desperate combat. A Story That Challenges Reality Envisioned by Mikael Hedberg, acclaimed writer behind modern horror classics “SOMA” and “Amnesia”, Alone in the Dark’s intricate web of mystery delves into themes of trauma, faith, evil, and abandonment. Whether you choose to brave the nightmare as Emily or Edward, you will uncover secrets that defy everything you thought about videogame storytelling.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/1015/b3a91fa43661ced3d57a908c26f5bfab057584343be6f618.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4389-PPSA08135_00-ALONEINTHEDARKEU","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":18,"genre":"Horror, Adventure, Puzzle","id":"EP4389-PPSA08135_00-ALONEINTHEDARKEU","PlusPrice":909.35,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/alone-in-the-dark","Popularity":"","Title":"Alone in the Dark","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"THQ NORDIC GMBH","ReleaseDate":"2024-03-20","Slug":"alone-in-the-dark-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1399.00","MainExtra":10,"SalePrice":"979.30","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"63","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"Previous special offer price valid from 10-11-2023 to 13-11-2023 was (Â£2.49 / €2.99 / AU $4.79 / BGN 5.99 / CZK 79.9 / DKK 21.9 / HUF 1059 / NZ $5.49 / NOK 32.9 / PLN 12.4 / SEK 30.9 / USD $2.69 / ZAR 53.9 / HRK N/A / INR 199 / TRY 21.9 / ILS 11.9) On a mysterious remote island, a skull washes up on shore and is reawakened by an enigmatic deity.

Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as mysterious dangers await. Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria—known as Khazad-dÃ»m or Dwarrowdelf—in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there’s clatter, there’s combat. Excavate the mysteries of three legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within. Key Game Features: â—� Feel the Fellowship: Experience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. â—� Survive the Dark: To survive the treacherous Mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain. â—� Base Building: Find solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to destroy Dwarven progress. â—� Rebuild and Reshape Moria: Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dÃ»m to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses. Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources. â—� Explore: Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger, providing a unique experience each and every time. â—� Co-op Multiplayer: Adventure alone or band together with friends in online cooperative multiplayer. â—� Craft Dwarven Tools, Weapons and More: Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor, tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines. â—� Uncover Magic Artifacts: Discover ancient magic items including swords that glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom. â—� Mine Ore and Jewels: Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril. Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear. But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness. â—� Comprehensive Dwarf Builder: Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator. Dwarves can be customized in a variety of ways to create a unique Dwarven identity. Then, during gameplay, players can find and craft armor and weapons to further enhance their unique style.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0520/d7bb0cab42052c1946d6fdcf236f059ee850819f9008843c.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7581-PPSA16618_00-0277621140622233","MainStory":35,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":83,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP7581-PPSA16618_00-0277621140622233","PlusPrice":525,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria","Popularity":"","Title":"The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moriaâ„¢","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"North Beach Games","ReleaseDate":"2023-12-04","Slug":"the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"875.00","MainExtra":48,"SalePrice":"525.00","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"51","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product is a VR experience lasting around 2 hours.

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. The game centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a shockingly enjoyable sci-fi action running game where the player uses techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action bundle and with it re-invents the running game genre.

Born into a new world where biological humanity is extinct but human culture lives on in a city of robots, you find yourself swept up in a mind-bending adventure involving a mysterious megastructure hiding enormous powers. The more you discover, the more you will be confronted with questions about the nature of the cosmos and the purpose of civilization.

A New Generation of Puzzles Solve a wide array of puzzles with varying difficulty levels, including clever metapuzzles and highly challenging Gold puzzles. Finish the game without solving every puzzle, or pursue the rewards of complete mastery. A variety of new abilities, such as gravity manipulation and mind transference, join the established mechanics of the original Talos Principle, creating a fresh but familiar experience. A Philosophical Odyssey Take the next step forward in the story of The Talos Principle in a thought-provoking, character-driven interactive story with multiple endings penned by returning writers Jonas Kyratzes (The Eternal Cylinder, Clash: Artifacts of Chaos) and Tom Jubert (The Swapper, Subnautica), joined by Verena Kyratzes (The Hand of Merlin, Serious Sam 4).

In this dark fantasy adventure you solve intricate cases and unveil abysmal secrets as Inquisitor Mordimer Madderdin. The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation. Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy’s weak points against them.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0813/6c0abbadb6ee8ae04ec8ba8c2b225bedacea0bd6a8733cd9.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA10961_00-0THEINQUISITORDX","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP4365-PPSA10961_00-0THEINQUISITORDX","PlusPrice":629.3,"Popularity":"","Title":"The Inquisitor - Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Kalypso Media GMBH","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-08","Slug":"the-inquisitor-deluxe-edition-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"899.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"629.30","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-05","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product includes both the PS4Ãƒ‚Ã‚Â® and PS5Ãƒ‚Ã‚Â® digital versions for download.

Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise. But what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart. Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic EvilnessÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢. Features: • Everything is better with DwarvesÃƒÂ¢„Ã‚Â¢: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources. • It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! • Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. • New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. • Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. • Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. • Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. • Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

Following the arrest of a prominent community leader, New York stands in disarray.

With the city’s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city’s fate. Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences.

Nobody needs to die… unless you decide they must.

The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-18","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2520-CUSA23292_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"90%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP2520-CUSA23292_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","PlusPrice":62.9,"Popularity":"","Title":"Disjunction - Digital Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-27","Slug":"disjunction-digital-deluxe-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"62.90","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-05","LowestPrice":"","description":"Lose Your Head Bundle contains a powerful combination, almost guaranteed to make your head pop!

Black Iron, a state-of-the-art penitentiary located on Jupiter’s icy moon Callisto, is overrun with hordes of infected inmates. As a modest prison guard your job is simple – get to the last escape pod and get out alive! Fight through dozens of unique enemies and challenging environmental hazards as you battle your way out of the prison. But you aren’t the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals – a deranged custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more – can’t wait to step over your corpse and save themselves. Only one of you can make it off the moon – make sure it’s you! FIGHT/DIE/ADAPT Each death is a learning experience. Starting fresh each run, build up your loadout with powerful experiments, weapon schematics, and buffs to battle through Black Iron. When you die (and you will die), use your hard-earned loot to purchase new permanent weapons, suits, and skills. Get stronger, experiment with your strategy, and get out! ROUT YOUR RIVALS You're not the only person to survive the initial outbreak or willing to use a bit of violence to get to the last escape pod. Some prisoners and even your correctional services colleagues are just as eager to escape and will make escaping harder by attacking you remotely or challenging you to a one-on-one duel. Race them, attack them back remotely, and fight them to the death to make it out in one piece. FIGHT YOUR LAST CORPSE When you die, you leave more than a coverall-clad carcass. Defeat the reanimated corpse of the last guard to succumb to the prison’s dangers to earn a powerful experiment. But beware, it’s not going to be an easy fight. The semi-alive guard has the same loadout they had when they met an untimely end and a few extra tricks up its sleeve to keep things spicy. DO OR DIE You’ve made the perfect build, battled through bosses, ran through rivals, killed your corpse, found all the files, and now you’re standing in front of that last escape pod. Sure, you could leave it all behind for the sweet taste of freedom… or risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the prison. Fail and you lose all your purchased gear, skills, suits, and weapons. But IF you succeed, you’ll unlock new powerful permanent gear. FUTURE PUNK An irreverent attitude, unique presentation, vivid graphic novel style, and a 180bpm original arcade-punk soundtrack by Mutato Muzika enhance [REDACTED]’s sci-fi setting and fast white-knuckle action.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202408/0304/03184e9f61ecf26dcd322f65376f4f79b29ca8d2242a6560.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1970-PPSA13647_00-00000BIRDPS5SIEE","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action","id":"EP1970-PPSA13647_00-00000BIRDPS5SIEE","PlusPrice":612.5,"Popularity":"","Title":"[REDACTED]","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"KRAFTON, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2024-10-27","Slug":"redacted-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"875.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"656.25","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"Stickman: Far East Battle is an exciting arcade game where you have to help the stickman eliminate all the enemies on the screen.

With its new-found intelligence, the rabbit vowed to take revenge on the humans who subjected it to painful experimentation. - A fast-paced platformer utilizing teleportation - A game that is easy to learn but hard to master, requiring lots of effort and determination - Eight different underground areas presented in charming pixel art - Complete time trial in the Speedrun Mode","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202409/1808/cccb6ee4cade3ee54233c824e14808acc0bc7d051baaa4c3.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/JB0780-PPSA22929_00-0200022057825509","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action","id":"JB0780-PPSA22929_00-0200022057825509","PlusPrice":261.75,"Popularity":"","Title":"Telebbit","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"HYPER REAL","ReleaseDate":"2024-10-24","Slug":"telebbit-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"349.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"279.20","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"A tsundere, a yandere, and… a desk?

Embark on quests, hunt down treasures and manage your resources as you build, battle, cast magic and brew potions to bring order to a world on the brink of disaster. MAIN FEATURES: EXPLORE: Strange creatures living in different locations await you. Some of them will help you, others need your help, and others will take a liking to your head...or, rather, your fresh brains. You will visit quiet villages, snow-capped mountaintops, impenetrable forests, and foul-smelling swamps. But one thing will remain the same - adventure awaits you everywhere! GATHER RESOURCES:Collect everything that isn't bolted to the floor! Dwarves don't mind work, but they won't lift a finger on an empty stomach. You can't build a working mill out of mud and sticks, so you'll have to search for the appropriate materials. Keep food stocked and resources plentiful and your world will expand! BUILD: Build bridges over turbulent rivers, build docks in the swamps, repair buildings, and build new ones! Mills will provide food, sawmills will provide building materials, forges will improve equipment - and you can always sell the surplus at the market. Many building styles and colors await you in the game. GO QUESTING: The citizens of the world have always had many problems to overcome and quests to embark on. Try to help everyone you can, and reap the rewards of your labours. You can also always count on what's most important: sincere words of gratitude. FIGHT: You can get much further with a kind word and a sword than you can with a kind word alone. Hire experienced soldiers, upgrade their armour and weapons, fight, and conquer. Whoever said the pen is mightier than the sword has never been on the receiving end of a Claymore! And with the ‘Tales’ mode introduced in the latest update, battles will be more exciting than ever. Choose from 3 difficulty levels as you play the two initial chapters dedicated to battles. CAST SPELLS: Not enough food or materials? Are your soldiers dying from their wounds? Did the workers decide to create a union? Magic items and potions will remedy the situation! Save up your gold, complete quests, and plunder chests. There are many ways to get magic items!","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202407/2321/10404a6c5bbab5bdc3e5292b32d15e526ff771685cb590e1.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EB0955-CUSA48609_00-0468883989631788","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy","id":"EB0955-CUSA48609_00-0468883989631788","PlusPrice":341.25,"Popularity":"","Title":"The Unexpected Quest","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Dmitrii Milovidov trading as OverGamez","ReleaseDate":"2024-09-26","Slug":"the-unexpected-quest-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"525.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"420.00","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"\"In Before Exit: Supermarket, as a supermarket employee, your job is to close the store at night.

Well, maybe this is not completely legal, but use the money received to buy new weapons for the towers or upgrade the ones already installed. This money received from the drivers is not going to solve all your problems, and if you depended on it alone, you would already be dead. For this reason, each enemy killed can release an orb that raises your experience bar. Every time this experience bar fills up, you level up and can temporarily improve your skills. In this way, the more enemies you kill during a wave, the more orbs you collect and the stronger you get. Not everything may go as planned and sooner or later you will end up being killed by these gangs. When this happens, don't despair, because the total number of enemies you have killed during the match is also converted into money!

Volgarr the Viking II is a hardcore, 2D action-platformer where precision is everything and one false move can spell a brutal death. Players of the original game will feel right at home on this relentless voyage, even with the addition of new power-ups, new forms of magic, new enemy types, and a chest-thumping new soundtrack. While the sequel delivers the same unforgiving 1980s-arcade level of difficulty as the original, Volgarr the Viking II also (mercifully, begrudgingly) offers modern quality-of-life options such as checkpoints, save states, and an undead mode. You decide how punishing your quest should be – but now anyone can be a viking!

As long as you find a way to steal them. Know that a thief’s trade is not a piece of cake. In order to get some practice, you’ll start with petty theft. This is how you’ll gain the experience required to access more and more risky – and most importantly, more profitable – jobs. Gain levels and unlock new possibilities. Get useful tools. Together with newly acquired skills, they will pave the way to expensive items, which you can then sell on the black market. The tools of your trade include a crowbar and binoculars, as well as advanced equipment that becomes available as you progress, such as a laptop for hacking through security systems. The creators of Thief Simulator 2 have prepared two unique locations with houses, banks, restaurants, and other special places that you’ll get to strip of money, valuables, and other items. But before you do, examine the surroundings: find out when the building empties out, learn the tenants’ or the employees’ schedule. Then you just need to prepare a strategy and it’s gone time. Just be quick and efficient. You don’t have much time, so you’ll need to immediately assess which item to take and which one to leave. Can you handle the pressure, or will you panic? Make sure to work on cars between robbing buildings. Start with small family sedans and make gradual steps towards mastery, which will allow you to steal the coolest sports cars. Remember to keep your eyes around your head. Even the best plan can fall apart, and the local police are just waiting for a chance to put you in handcuffs. Don’t get caught. Always be one step ahead of law enforcement. Feature list: -Two neighbourhoods, with over 20 houses to break into. Learn tenant's routines, pick the right time to break in, and then rob them -Three heists, each with a unique location. Make your way into a resort with 6 houses full of loot, a warehouse crawling with guards, and a central bank with gold waiting to be snatched from the vault. -Get better and better tools, ranging from a crowbar or binoculars to hacking laptops, stethoscopes, etc. -Make your way into houses undetected, or run in welding a baton and knock everyone out. Alternatively, put them to sleep using sleeping gas or a tranquilizer gun. The choice is up to you. -Payphone missions - rob certain locations in a specified amount of time -Over 15 contracts requiring you to steal unique items -Level up your thief and acquire new skills, which allow a number of new possibilities. Learn special skills, and activate unique abilities. -Escape the police - intense chases with police cars and helicopters. Be careful to not get shot. -Upgrade your car, change its color, give it more power - or just buy a sports car and be no match for the police. -Steal cars - begin with a small, family sedan, and work your way up to a sport's dream car","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202404/2613/126f315a1948c131d9d417cf28e17bf831d92d6295cf0af5.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5987-PPSA21997_00-0261948773137492","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Simulation","id":"EP5987-PPSA21997_00-0261948773137492","PlusPrice":419.4,"Popularity":"","Title":"Thief Simulator 2","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"ULTIMATE GAMES","ReleaseDate":"2024-07-12","Slug":"thief-simulator-2-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"699.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"454.35","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"In True Virus, you play the role of a mental hospital patient who has awoken in a world devastated by a deadly pandemic.

For that he needs a place to land in the middle of nowhere to make a stop halfway to his destination. In return he is willing to cut you in on his deals. The Airstrip You have plenty of space and as it turned out, there used to be an old military landing strip during WWII close to your gas station. Should be that hard to make it work again, right? You might even go a step further, order some aviation fuel and some parts for planes. A windsock wouldn’t probably hurt and some lights might turn out to be useful, since you will on occasion also need to help him land. Let’s see how things develop and what Joe is up to... The Plane Joe’s plane is like its pilot: old. It’s also simple. The most advanced technology on this thing is the LED reading light Joe uses to find his way on the chart. How hard can it be to fix some simple things on a small plane? And it’s not like you are doing it for free. The Gameplay The Airstrip DLC brings new game mechanics and content to Gas Station Simulator based on events.

Mentally unstable clown with a hook for a hand? A bored rich man telling you to punch random people on the street? We have them all, and then some! You’ll meet them all while following the insane storyline (yes, this game has an actual story!) Day-to-day survival can be exhausting, so why not take a break and get some shut-eye in a cozy shelter? Conquer, construct, and customize your cardboard bases to your heart’s content. However, remember to build some defenses as the rival bum gang raids are inevitable! Crafting makes your life easier. Collect materials and process them to get upgrades and expansions to your base. Tired of searching for food? Construct pots and plant some vegetables. Need stronger pigeons? Better upgrade that coop. Scavenging for scrap got boring? Recruit other bums to do the dirty work for you. With enough work, you can build a truly self-sustainable bum base! Hear ye, hear ye! Every character in the game is fully voiced. Each line of dialogue oozes emotion and personality, which makes the game's storyline and atmosphere even gross… er… more engrossing!","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202406/1310/f9dad731c9e170693651b9445befa4fc7f4d373e8823a93d.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1549-PPSA19625_00-CLABS1BS20231009","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Simulation, Adventure, Action","id":"EP1549-PPSA19625_00-CLABS1BS20231009","PlusPrice":341.25,"Popularity":"","Title":"Bum Simulator","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PlayWay plc","ReleaseDate":"2024-06-23","Slug":"bum-simulator-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"525.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"341.25","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"Cross-buy: With the purchase of this bundle you will receive the PlayStationÂ®4 and PlayStationÂ®5 version of the game.

The players will have to crack some grim criminal cases by exploring the world around them, rediscover the mysterious identity of the protagonist, cross the borders of inherent dangers and formal logic and create their own vision of time and history. BECOME A MYSTERY HUNTER A true hunter always trusts their gut instincts. They see moments of doubt as a waste of time as the path to the truth lies clear before their mind’s eye. It’s an intricate network of barely visible strings and links between other people’s secrets, mysteries and motives… You just have to pull the right string which will lead you to the solution. Become a hunter whose primary weapons are his mind and heart. COMPOSE YOUR VISION OF THE WORLD FROM BITS OF INFORMATION The main feature of this game is the unusual mix of sci-fi, social fiction, detective and horror. Each genre presents a unique story; the players may freely combine fragments of information from them all to create their own versions of this world, its history and the causes of main events. The identity of the protagonist is a mystery itself, and you’ll have to approach the storyline like a puzzle to solve it. FOLLOW THE STORIES OF THOSE WHO GOT LOST IN THIS LABYRINTH BEFORE Each and every person who had passed through this world before the protagonist came had their own vision of what was going on. Each and every one of them left some clues. The data that you’ll eventually gather might sometimes be inconsistent and controversial, but there will also be similar or even duplicate bits of valuable information.

To contemplate one's life means to knock oneself down, to stop, to begin to go over one's experiences, to discard the superfluous and unnecessary, to destroy the old in the hope of constructing the new, in other words, to be undermined. It is impossible not to note the severity of this word because this action is associated with pain, loss, the need to choose difficult routes, and sometimes taking risks so as not to make new mistakes and not to fall off the set path. But is it worth enduring the pain? What happens if we simply go with the flow? How will our lives turn out then? The French philosopher Albert Camus asked similar questions in his famous essay \"The Myth of Sisyphus. In brief, the ancient Greek myth is as follows: the gods condemned Sisyphus, because he was too arrogant and too dodgy, to roll a huge stone up the mountain, which kept falling and had to start all over again. It would seem that what could be worse than this useless work? What was Sisyphus thinking as he climbed to the top of the mountain? And what do we care about him? Maybe we should admit that our lives are a bit like this Sisyphus? Approach Albert Camus's thoughts and feelings, his philosophy. Perhaps you will find some answers to these difficult questions. • Explore the world around you and find philosophical notes. • Take the stone to the top, higher and higher, and if it falls, well, start over, that's your punishment. • Choose your path correctly. Your decisions will determine the end of the game. • Discover the philosophy of Albert Camus. Don't try to understand every word, just let it pass through you. • Enjoy the abstract game world, and find different ways of passing. • And also listen to atmospheric music and sound effects.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/1720/2ec7923b93669974f8483c69eb15b79f726c80c93b2ed5f8.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2029-CUSA44262_00-0936199158514762","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP2029-CUSA44262_00-0936199158514762","PlusPrice":52.35,"Popularity":"","Title":"Heavy Burden","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Whale Rock Games OOO","ReleaseDate":"2024-01-23","Slug":"heavy-burden-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"349.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"69.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"This Bundle include Avatars and Game.

He sent his son, the Prince, to Earth and ordered him to create a large katamari. The Prince rolled the katamari and made the katamari bigger and bigger, rolling up all the things on the earth. The katamari that he created floated in space, sparkling, and brought back the lost starry sky. As the starry sky was restored, the King's fans gradually grew in number all over the world. The King wanted to respond to the wishes of his fans for his success, and the Prince kept rolling the katamari to make everyone's dreams come true. • We Love Katamari Damacy has been powered up! We Love Katamari Damacy, the second title in the Katamari series released in 2005, has been remastered. The graphics have been completely redesigned, and the in-game UI has been revamped to make it even easier to play. • New additional features such as Royal Reverie are also available! In his youth, the King received a strict education from his father, the Great King. New challenges have been added where you can roll around as the King in his boyhood! The days of hard study and intense training can all be rolled through in 5 all-new challenges. Will the young King be able to clear the tough challenges? In addition, a selfie mode has been added, allowing the Prince and his cousins to take quick photos while rolling through the stages! • A simple but very deep game! Roll the katamari, roll up objects, and make the katamari bigger. You can roll up anything from paper clips and snacks in the house, to telephone poles and buildings in the town, to even living creatures such as people and animals. Once the katamari is complete, it will turn into a star that colors the night sky. You cannot roll up anything larger than the current size of your katamari, so the key is to think in advance about the order in which you roll things up around the stage! * This product is based on the We Love Katamari Damacy software that was released in 2005 on another platform.

Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

You have to perform increasingly complex tasks in prison, balancing the administration's assessment and inmates' satisfaction. In the game, you play the role of a prison guard and it is only up to you whether you decide to obey the law or let this place and people corrupt you completely. After all, who said you had to be an exemplary ranger? Maybe you prefer to trade with prisoners, help them smuggle, and bet on the outcome of fights in prison instead? After all, everyone likes to have fun sometimes. Especially in a sad place like this, where you are also the boss. Or at least you think so. So how? Will you choose to follow the rules, intercept contraband, count prisoners, send them to work, take care of their basic needs and keep prison gangs under control? Will you go to the dark side? Whatever you decide, remember that your actions will affect both the facility itself and the inmates, and above all, the further course of your career. Unique features of the game: - try to balance between following the orders of your superiors and doing small favors for the inmates.

Will you be able to escape? Beginning in the dungeons deep in the bowels of Castle Rock, you and a fellow prisoner must seek a way out and return to stand again beneath the icy Antarctic skies - but escaping this nightmare is not so easy as just leaving the castle itself. If you can free yourself from the cells, you’ll need to make choices about where to explore next. Outside the Keep, you will discover the story of Rockbury, its inhabitants, and plans of a resistance formed against the King to escape this icy place. Hope will lead you on to an eerie Graveyard and have you descend down into the dark waters of the Foundry. Someone, or something, has brought you here, and you are a central part of a plan centuries in the making. Only an unshakeable bond with your partner will give you any hope of survival in the face of such dreadful desire… FEATURES • Two player co-op: the puzzles you encounter take two to solve - you both have a role to play!

He progresses on his journey, raiding trading convoys, upgrading the ships and, of course, always keeping an eye on the morale of the crew. While doing so, he tries to persuade fellow pirate captains to join his fleet, all with with their own ships and individual abilities. With even bigger prizes in his sights, he will not stop until he is undisputedly the greatest pirate of the Caribbean. BECOME THE PIRATE OF ALL PIRATES • You are not born a great pirate, but we give you the tools to make you THE great pirate. Customize your own Flag under which your fleet will sail. As you gain experience, your notoriety and skills will improve. Roleplay with more than 35 distinct pirate’s skills on your way to claim your pirate throne. RAID AND VOYAGE THE CARIBBEAN SEA • The Caribbean of the 17th century is dominated by the four colonial powers of the Old World. Being a pirate is not your fault, but it is your responsibility! Take action to relieve the Spanish, Dutch, French and English colonies from their burden of drowning in riches. But be wary! Unless you are sure you are the biggest fish in the sea, don’t venture out too early or too far from your trusted hometown port. ENGAGE IN TACTICAL NAVAL BATTLES • A ship is safe in a harbor, but that’s not what ships are made for. Fight in tactical turn-based naval battles on a hexagonal grid of epic proportions. Use your wits when raiding a convoy or a settlement. Victory is determined by a clever combination of your ship’s distinct armament with the varying and rough conditions of the sea. UPGRADE YOUR FLEET • It is your job to maintain and upkeep a formidable fleet before facing the cannon hail of those mighty warships lurking in the seas. Combining distinct upgrades of your ship’s basic gear, such as weaponry, hull, mast, or figurehead allows for more than 360 unique loadouts. MEET YOUR CREW’S NEEDS • As an elected captain of the ship, it is your responsibility to split the spoils and riches with your crew. Agreeing on so-called ‘articles of capture’ clearly define the objectives you embark on before leaving port. Remember the whispers of mutiny below the decks can lead to nasty outcome. After all, you are an elected captain and not placed by the grace of the Lord. PARLEY WITH INFAMOUS PIRATE LEGENDS • On your journey to become the most fearsome, most glorious pirate captain, you will have the opportunity to get to know several historic pirates. Choose your foes and companions wisely… COMMAND HISTORICAL SHIPS • Featuring 18 unique types of ships such as Ship of the Line, Frigate, War Galleon and many more. DROWN IN QUESTS • Sink more than 25 hours into stories set in the Golden Age of Piracy. The world is your oyster after all. Governors and fellow pirate companion provide you with valuable questlines where a few doubloons can be made. Also don’t forget to seek out the local tavern and eavesdrop on the latest rumors. A bottle of rum loosens the tongue, showing the way to treasures otherwise hidden…","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1516/gmXJznLBssugZ8NH5I4UnmZr.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA06765_00-000000000TORTUGA","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Strategy, Simulation","id":"EP4365-PPSA06765_00-000000000TORTUGA","PlusPrice":681.85,"Popularity":"","Title":"Tortuga - A Pirate's Tale","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Kalypso Media GMBH","ReleaseDate":"2023-01-18","Slug":"tortuga-a-pirates-tale-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"681.85","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"/game/122943","description":"[Overview] A refreshing and highly re-playable bullet hell style shooter that WANTS you to play dangerously! \"Graze\" past enemy bullets to charge your \"Graze Counter\", then unleash it upon your enemies as a highly deadly attack!

But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they’d ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she’s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can’t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years. While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she’s felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail’s death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202201/1802/YjVGmuGKJwCLYgAT5TIV2qur.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0734-PPSA03866_00-5656272672692226","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP0734-PPSA03866_00-5656272672692226","PlusPrice":357,"Popularity":"","Title":"Heart of the Woods","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SEKAI PROJECT, INC","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-05","Slug":"heart-of-the-woods-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"595.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"416.50","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game.

It features multiple endings where your choices truly matter. The Story: After your childhood friend Theo wins a weekend getaway to the town of Seaside, you prepare to spend your birthday in paradise. It's been months since you last saw Theo, and she's incredibly excited to spend the weekend together. She invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just the get-together that you need to reconnect. Everything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he's bringing along an uninvited guest. Although Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's about the only thing you share in common... Will you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star? The Cast: Theo is your childhood friend. Although initially shy with strangers, Theo has a great sense of humour and loves to joke around with her friends. She prefers to have a tight-knit group and doesn't open up to just anyone. She studies photography at the same college as her roommate Lena and loves spending time with her. Theo won a draw for a cottage getaway in the town of Seaside and is your host for the weekend. Lena is Theo's roommate... and replacement best friend. You don't know much about her, or even what she's studying. From what you've seen on Friendex, Lena is a vibrant and outgoing person. She's always dyeing her hair different colours and wearing cute clothes. According to her online bio, in her spare time she enjoys hiking and playing piano. Alec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both have similar hobbies like gaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally, renting a student house with Alec seemed like a great idea... until he started dating. He jumps from girl to girl, never committing despite constantly whining that he wants a serious relationship. His latest date, Erika, tagged along to the cottage without an invitation. Lately, Alec has been annoying you... more than usual. A year younger than you, Erika is from the same hometown. You don't remember much about her, or ever talking to her...","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/0306/M9xVmLdfrt5HiWCDb62MsKWE.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7099-PPSA04331_00-PPGSHORESXXXXXXX","MainStory":1,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure, Adventure","id":"EP7099-PPSA04331_00-PPGSHORESXXXXXXX","PlusPrice":293.3,"Popularity":"","Title":"Starlight Shores","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Penguin Pop Games LLC","ReleaseDate":"2022-01-25","Slug":"starlight-shores-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"419.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"293.30","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"DonutRun is a Runner style arcade game where the user leaps and dashes through obstacles to get to the finish line.

Fix damaged PCBs Not all parts need to be replaced entirely. You can use special workbenches to repair damaged PCBs, clean and maintain parts that have worn out during rover's work. Thanks to this, you can save resources for much more difficult tasks. Gain Experience The game offers you several development paths that you can choose. Are you a tinkerer who enjoys disassembling devices into small parts? Become a technician! But if you prefer to precisely analyze the damaged parts and find malfunctions faster, then become an analyst. If you want to master the recovery of resources, follow the economist’s path. Gain experience, earn higher and higher ranks and undertake more and more difficult tasks. Become the best engineer on Mars!","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/0510/lEXCImdXFtCxmGECZbBD4ylC.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5987-CUSA30326_00-9720184840479106","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Simulator","id":"EP5987-CUSA30326_00-9720184840479106","PlusPrice":113.75,"Popularity":"","Title":"Rover Mechanic Simulator","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"ULTIMATE GAMES","ReleaseDate":"2021-12-06","Slug":"rover-mechanic-simulator-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"455.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"136.50","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"SushiRun is a Runner style arcade game where the user leaps and dashes through obstacles to get to the finish line.

The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won’t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King’s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter’s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King’s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose. • The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty. As you progress, you'll come across Easter eggs, things that’ll crack you up and allusions to other games coupled with self-mockery • Randomly generated locations of items, artifacts, traps, rooms in the building, enemies and bosses • 12 characters, all with different performance and equipment • Customized equipment which can be upgraded with rocks, runes and enchantments • Secret features and tricks (e.g. get a firesword by plunging your sword into the lava) • Jaw-dropping action with various moves, skills and spells!","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/1314/p9Xoj3zDWsHsxVd3qyJsR5SE.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5506-CUSA29830_00-PLPA000000000000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"69%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role Playing Games, Action","id":"EP5506-CUSA29830_00-PLPA000000000000","PlusPrice":25.12,"Popularity":"","Title":"Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BIG WAY LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-26","Slug":"princesslootpixelagain-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"157.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"48.67","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"/game/95236","description":"This gripping paranormal horror adventure revolves around Hermitage, the sinister bookstore that attracts most unusual customers – all of whom seem to be involved in mysterious cases bordering on the paranormal.

Work with item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and return fire.

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity’s last line of defense. Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF.

Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive? If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode! Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play. You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type. The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it.

For example, the knight is thrilling the land, stunning all the enemies on the line, while the huntress is charging a bow with energy, simultaneously firing arrows at all the enemies.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/1411/LC0uiHU3uttHiKMgXVZFN8Wo.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4897-CUSA25541_00-9434239514976816","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Puzzle","id":"EP4897-CUSA25541_00-9434239514976816","PlusPrice":26.25,"Popularity":"","Title":"Guards","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"DRAGEUS GAMES S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-20","Slug":"guards-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"175.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"35.00","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game.

This second entry into the My Name is Mayo Cinematic Universe (not a thing btw) features the same real-life tapping mechanics and dozens of unlockable achievements as the original game.

One of them features little minigames! • Unlock the 50 super-unique achievements! • Fill the Mayo album with the 50 ultra rare, 1950’s inspired, collectable cards! • Pointlessly compete with your friends and the world with the online “clicks” leaderboards! Frequently Asked Questions Q: Wait a minute... Is this a sequel to My Name is Mayo? A: Yes. Q: Why would you do such a thing?? A: Isolation in 2020 has been interesting to say the least. Also we couldn’t resist peer pressure. Q: Well, is it a Next-Gen leap for the franchise? A: Huh? Franchise? Well, the graphics are 1080p, 60fps. 1950’s graphic-art inspired. Only the best! Q: Is it better than the original? A: ... Define “better”... Q: Good lord, what does the game even have? A: More of the stuff from the first game! 4 new stories to follow along; 10 more crazy facts to discover; some weird minigames sprinkled throughout; and one messed-up Mayo. Q: Are there at least achievements or something? A: Yup! 50 of them in fact, laid out in a nice card album for you to collect! Q: What’s the gameplay like? Is it still a clicker? A: Yup. Click the Mayo jar and the gameplay will “click” with you right away! “Tap” into the psyche of Mayo and “Mouse-y” along the quirky stories! Q: Please no more puns...

THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-25","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Simulation, Strategy","id":"EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000","PlusPrice":0,"Popularity":"","Title":"Frostpunk: Console Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"11 Bit Studios S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2019-10-10","Slug":"frostpunk-console-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"1049.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"209.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2025-03-12","LowestPrice":"","description":"Big Drunk Satanic Massacre is basically a shooter with strong RPG elements - not that rocket propelled gun, though.

Please note: DLC must be downloaded separately. It’s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE INFECTED Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.","SaleStarted":"2025-02-16","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202501/3115/3c17bf3bb4c9b5b572f69217554f0afdebade3a37959bac3.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2GAME0000000EU","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Unique","id":"EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2GAME0000000EU","PlusPrice":0,"Popularity":"","Title":"Dying Light 2 Stay Human","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TECHLAND SP.

But you must return before the sun sets so you can bolster your defenses, craft powerful equipment, and fend off the nightly assaults. ·Roguelite Meets Survival Action: Each gameplay session begins with your tribe being dropped into a fresh, procedurally generated world, equipped with nothing but the loincloth on their backsides and an eternal oath to save the world. Gain knowledge, meta experience, and account unlocks each session to aid you in your quest to hold off Ragnarök for as longas you can. The longer you and your tribe survive, the greater the rewards! ·Face Colossal Game-Changers: Protect the Seed of Yggdrasil from a nightly invasion of Helthings and work together with your tribe to withstand the ever-looming threat of the Jötnar—epic giants hellbent on smashing both the Seed and your surrounding village to bits. The world (and the game) ends when the Seed is destroyed. ·Forge Your Viking Legend: Level up your character each session by choosing a class and taking the battle into the wilds as you seek resources tocraft epic armor and mighty weaponry. Discover and equip powerful runes tocomplement your playstyle in surprising ways. Then, unleash destruction andprepare clever village defenses to give your enemies some nasty surprises. ·Rally the Tribe: When the giants arrive, it takes a village to bring them down! Adventure through Midgard solo or form a tribe of up to 10 players in online PvE co-op. Test your Viking skills against the seasonal challenges of Saga Mode or tailor the experience to your liking and see how long you can “surthrive” in the highly customizable Survival mode. We recommend taking on Ragnarök with a tribe of four or more. ·Explore a Bright Norse Realm: Gather resources, slay legendary beasts, delve through caves, claim treasure, and build anywhere as you explore formidable, procedurally generated lands on your quest to take on Ragnarök. ·Keep Up the Fight: Free, limited time seasonal events will bring bigger challenges and even mightier treasures to the endgame of Midgard throughout the year, including new ways to play and new rewards to earn through the season’s unlockable progression track.
