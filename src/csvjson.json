Enter a labyrinth that moves as you move, where mastering the elements is key to defeating enemies and uncovering the mysteries of this underground world. With a new experience awaiting every time you enter the dungeon, let the power bestowed by the crown guide you in this challenging adventure! Procedurally Generated Maze The procedurally-generated maze ensures you have a different experience every time you enter the dungeon. But unlike traditional open maps, Crown Trick locks you inside a small dungeon room to do battle with monsters. Without access to the entire map, you have no choice but to strategically decide how you will mount an attack on the enemy. Synchronous Turn-Based Strategy The game moves as you move, and your enemies will stand still until you decide what\u2019s the best way to attack. Take however long you need to map out your route, decide the best way to avoid traps, or how to use the elements to your advantage. A carefully thought out strategy is the key to escaping this dungeon alive.

At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout. It's a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. When the game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life. Playable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede. The gameplay varies considerably between seasons, vignettes, and moments.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_WhereTheBeesMakeHoney_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/where-the-bees-make-honey-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"1","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8i70TDEC58","PeruPrice":"5.87","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":"1","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Other","ArgentinaPrice":"25","AustraliaPrice":"13.29","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_WhereTheBeesMakeHoney.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"5300","SouthafricaPrice":"145","BrazilPrice":"6.48","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Where the Bees Make Honey","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Whitethorn Digital","ReleaseDate":"2019-10-17","Slug":"where-the-bees-make-honey-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"35.5","ChilePrice":"1174","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"47.50","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"2.49"},{"CanadaPrice":"5","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-06-16","LowestPrice":"3.99","SaleStarted":"2022-05-26","description":"Wenjia is a 2D platform game with puzzle-solving elements.

Sometimes simply rotating or extending the box is not enough, and you have to find the right combination of rotating and extending to jump or climb over obstacles. Players progress through the game by guiding the box towards the goal in each Chamber. Some Chambers have multiple goals, and depending on which goals you reach, the game diverges into seven different routes. There also exists a secret route that can only be unlocked under certain conditions. To clear each route you must reach the colored goal that appears at the end. The seven basic routes and one secret route equal a total of fifty Chambers all together for you to challenge. The game also features original music composed by sanodg to accompany you as you play throughout the game. HD rumble will also allow you to feel which direction the box extends in.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TorqueLPhysicsModifiedEdition_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/torquel-physics-modified-edition-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"","genre":"Puzzle,Action,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.25","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TorqueLPhysicsModifiedEdition.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"24.30","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"TorqueL -Physics Modified Edition-","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"PLAYISM","ReleaseDate":"2018-02-15","Slug":"torquel-physics-modified-edition-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"6","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"29.04","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.00","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-06-17","LowestPrice":"1.52","SaleStarted":"2022-05-28","description":"Toonkars Racer is Cute and Toon Racing Game, You Can Race These Sweet Toon Cars With Low Poly Designed Graphics!

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"1.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8Vlv9L9VM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"3","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"81","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"19","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"29.99","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-06-27","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-06-06","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

He's grown prudent, amicable, kind and caring, without any intention to cause major mayhem just to further his own selfish ends. It seems he is far from chaining himself to flaming saw blades, training torpedo-dolphins or foraging through platypus nests. Or is he? Ultimately it's a flaming saw blade grounding Goal on Deponia again. By accident, her consciousness gets split into three parts and stored to three different discs. Now it's on Rufus once again to convince all three parts of Goal, utilizing his remarkable charming wits, to become one again, venture to Elysium with her and save Deponia from certain doom while he's at it.

The game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Renovate and decorate train stations and trains. Detailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements. Build your own station. Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TrainStationRenovation_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/train-station-renovation-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"8.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHoo9Hg5OZA","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"85%","Completionist":"17","genre":"Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.85","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TrainStationRenovation.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"34.20","BrazilPrice":"14.39","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Train Station Renovation","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Forever Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-06","Slug":"train-station-renovation-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"6.99","ChilePrice":"","Price":"18.99","MexicoPrice":"58.49","MainExtra":"13.5","SalePrice":"2.84"},{"CanadaPrice":"7.87","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-06-23","LowestPrice":"6.24","SaleStarted":"2022-06-09","description":"Lead the ultimate party of heroes into the Tower of Time, a vertical battleground filled with lore, mystery, and combat.

They were unable to enter the ship due to psychic phenomena. So they ask a psychic medium, \"Yumi Kisara spiritist\" to investigate the crashed ship. The objective is to recover the ID chips of the passengers and investigate the ship, but it seems that there is \"something\" lurking that cannot be easily solved. Fingers crossed for consideration! 【SYSTEM】 By acquiring various items on the ship, you can change your attack methods and expand your range of action. However, in order to acquire items, you must give up your HP (physical strength) as compensation. If you proceed without thinking, your HP will quickly dwindle and you will be killed by the slightest enemy attack. Play the game repeatedly and make choices that suit your style. 【INVESTIGATION】 The souls of the crew are still on board. By talking to them, you can obtain items and collect ID chips, and by obtaining ID chips, you can enter their private rooms. There are also reports from Dr. Simon and personal records of the crew, so you can investigate what happened on the ship.

Heroes Every hero has a special perk and a spell, in addition to the three stats (strength, dexterity, endurance). Gather your team of heroes, come up with unique tactics for battles. Traditional Tank, Healer and Warrior? Or would you only use brute force? During battles, the pre-selected 20 cards with spells are mixed into the deck. Every 6 seconds of combat you take a new card into your hand. During the normal turn, you will have a choice of actions: - Normal attack; - Defense; - Position change; - Casting a hero's spell (one for each); - Casting spells from hand Each spell, be it heroic or from a deck has its own mana cost. Mana is shared by all heroes and accumulates during battle. The player will have to choose which spell to use now, because there may not be enough mana for the next one.

The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food café, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging. The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects.

On a late-night highway drive, a quiet train car in the early hours, a walk through a moonlight park, or the endless wait in a deserted airport, we listen to weird music amid the ambient announcements of delays and question our place in the universe. Inspired by long travel and the stream of consciousness it fosters, Glitchhikers asks you to look inward. Find the answers to your questions and question the answers you receive. Ruminate on life, the universe, our place and purpose in it. Voyage through a freeform narrative experience, converse with the endless inevitability, and explore the cosmic, hopeful world you find yourself in.
