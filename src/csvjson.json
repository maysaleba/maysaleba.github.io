Their dynasty has been watching over Asposia for centuries on end. In secret, they fill the roly-poly world with light and life. But when their existence is discovered, they become hunted. Emil, a trader for odds and ends, made all the Asposians believe that the dynasty is in cahoots with dark forces. The only one who can stop the evil Emil is the heir to the throne: Robert.

Shoot first, listen later: Reflexes and memory are key to this game. We use rhythm as hints in certain parts, but you should trust more in your eyes. A more formal description: 64.0 is a minimal fast-paced arcade game, where you shoot the squares that have the same color as the background, but since the background is constantly changing, everyone can be a bad guy! Features: Fast-paced action. Awesome chiptune soundtrack. One unique mechanic each level. Endless mode.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_640_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/640-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"33%","genre":"Music,Arcade,Shooter,Action","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_640.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"22.50","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"100","Title":"64.0","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"indienova","ReleaseDate":"2019-10-31","Slug":"640-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"5","ChilePrice":"","Price":"2.99","MexicoPrice":"29","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"7.17","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-02-25","LowestPrice":"5.39","SaleStarted":"2022-02-04","description":"8 & 9 Ball Pocket brings you eight-ball pool and nine-ball pool, also known as American billiards.

Gameplay description In Ekstase, shapes of 3-5 blocks fall from the top, and as soon as they hit something, they fall apart. The scan line changes color every cycle and removes the squares you formed with blocks of the same color. Game modes Reach a \"state-of-flow\" in Flow mode Flow mode is the frictionless \"jump in\" game mode in which the game adapts to how you play. Are you getting better? The game will ramp up its difficulty. Are you getting worse? The game becomes easier. In doing so, the game teases out a \"state-of-flow\" in the player, a state in which you are fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, involvement, and enjoyment. Keep a beat with Beat99 Beat99 is the rhythm mode in Ekstase . The goal is to rank up your multiplier by dropping shapes to the beat. You'll be given 99 \"lives\", dropping a shape subtracts one life, missing a beat subtracts ten! Try to survive as long as possible and try to score as high as you possibly can.

Problem is, the path is broken in several places! To ensure that the current reaches the fan uninterrupted, you must create an electric arc wherever the circuit was damaged. Seems complicated?

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8Vlv9L9VM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"40%","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"81","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/110363/rogue-bit-switch","RussiaPrice":"295","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"19","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"49.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-02-08","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-01-18","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

Have you ever dreamed of being a landlord in a totalitarian state, so you can spy and report everyone? Well, it is now possible thanks to Beholder and its original 2D gameplay mixing management and spying mechanics with a choice-driven narrative. In this grim dystopian future, where privacy is dead and the State controls every aspect of life, will you choose to cling to your humanity or to be a ruthless landlord? In either case, prepare to be unsettled. To your tenants, you are Carl Stein, a government-installed landlord. However, that is simply a facade that hides your real mission: to covertly spy on your tenants.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality.

And if things get too tough then up to four local friends can grab controllers and aid the hero as player-controlled monsters, zombies, and bandits. The World Large, procedurally generated and interconnected lands range from plains, to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water.

Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items.

CO-OP PLAY REZ PLZ puts a unique spin on the traditional co-op concept. Instead of trying to keep each player alive through each level, you must strategically kill each other to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Use the Resurrection Scroll to bring Arcan and Zeph back to life. DEATH AROUND EVERY CORNER Death is everywhere in REZ PLZ, and can come from a multitude of one-hit deaths, ranging from being sliced in half, eaten by creatures, burned alive and more. UNLOCK MAGICAL SPELLS Unlock new spells to conquer the increasingly difficult challenges ahead, but be careful because these brothers are poor at magic and one bad spell can mean death! UNLOCKABLES Explore and find a bevy of unlockable cosmetic items and unlockable challenging gauntlet levels to customize your gameplay. Challenge yourself further with bonus modes such as PVP foot race. STORY REZ PLZ tells the story of Arcan and Zeph, two young apprentice wizards.
