In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-28","LowestPrice":"/game/68258","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","MainStory":16,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":34,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/deathloop","Title":"DEATHLOOP","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Bethesda","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-13","Slug":"deathloop-ps5-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/1ArSDNa2S0","IsPS5":1,"Price":599,"MainExtra":23,"SalePrice":149.75,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"88","SaleEnds":"2023-06-12","description":"BLAST YOUR WAY THROUGH AN INTERDIMENSIONAL ADVENTURE Ratchet and Clank are back!

As you explore the deceivingly charming world, you\u2019ll encounter a cast of unique companions, ready to aid you in your adventure.

It features a team of skilled warriors from all over the world who have been sent on a mission to defeat the ever-growing numbers of Ink Beasts. A World Blackened By The Ink Of Ruin The story is set in Ido, city of the morning moon, which continues to fight against the disaster known as the \u2018Ink of Ruin.\u2019 The city has a very traditional culture similar to medieval Japan and is essentially a fortress, with its protection coming from a strong magical technology boundary. This boundary resonates directly below the moon shining overhead, keeping everyone safe from being tainted. Will You Take Up This Quest? Tokinokuni, the city's leader, has commissioned a quest for carefully selected individuals from all over the world, known as \u2018Ink Destroyers\u2019, to go to the most dangerous areas. They will use their unique powers to conquer the various \u2018Ink Beasts\u2019 that are so feared by the people still left wandering at large. Investigate the labyrinths surrounding Ido and use your strength and strategy to guide your team to victory and ultimately conquer this nightmarish darkness. The Enemies You Must Overcome The Ink Beasts are born from the Ink of Ruin's taint. If the living encounter it, they will go mad, become demons or perish, and if the dead encounter it then they will be resurrected to roam and increase their numbers. Their only goal is to destroy and envelop the land with darkness, so you must overcome their stain to free this world once and for all from their destruction. These Ink Beasts will take on the form of many frightening demons and yokai from Japanese folklore and also raise the dead for their dark army, so be sure to strengthen your will before facing this enemy.

MEET THE CHICKEN POLICE Sonny Featherland and Marty MacChicken were once a legendary detective-duo, called the Chicken Police. But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before! NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them! EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...) There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor. KEY FEATURES - A thrilling, rich storyline with a classic film-noir twist - Professional voiceover with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! - A carefully crafted, \"\"colorful\"\" world - A complex interrogation system - More than 30 unique, fully voiced characters - A cinematic film-noir-like experience with more than 20 cutscenes! - Lots of clues, information, and collectibles to find - A beautiful original soundtrack NEW DualSense™ FEATURES: - Added more than 30 DualSense™ Controller supporting effects to the game. - Lots of minor short effects that help to immerse the player in the game like haptic feedback in menus or between options. - Increasing or changing resistance in the adaptive trigger action to imitate that the main character is entering a more focused state. - Continuous detailed rumble effect imitating a strong aura when hovering the cursor over a hidden collectible. - Within the minigames, you will not only feel the recoil but different haptics while pulling the triggers of different types of weapons. - Feel the inserting of single rounds into the cylinder of the revolver while reloading or the clicking of the dial of a rotary phone. - Added more than 70 effects to the different cutscenes of the game, making immersion much livelier than on any other platform.

Players assume the roles of an infantry squad or a tank crew commander or an aircraft pilot. \u2013 High input of each player in the team victory: despite the massiveness of the battles, the result is significantly defined by the performance of each player. \u2013 10+ distinctive squad classes like assault, sniper, heavy gun, mortar, flamethrower, anti-tank, engineer, radio specialists, tank crews, aircraft pilots and others. \u2013 Hundreds of weapons, ground vehicles and aircraft types. Each of them is based on a real model used in the specific historical campaign of World War II. \u2013 A player can customize and train squads according to their individual playing style, unlock perks and upgrades as long as this does not contradict the historical accuracy principle.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-28","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202110/2914/1FtSxlCXOyH1pHt3oAxBqkHx.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4432-CUSA29340_00-ENB0250000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter","PlusPrice":299.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202110/2914/1FtSxlCXOyH1pHt3oAxBqkHx.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Enlisted: \"Normandy\": Vanguard Bundle","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Gaijin Distribution KFT","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-04","Slug":"enlisted-normandy-vanguard-bundle-ps4&ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":599,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":299.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-12","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird.

These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively. ■ More action-filled real-time battles!

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before! NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them! EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...) There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor. KEY FEATURES - A thrilling, rich storyline with a classic film-noir twist - Professional voiceover with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! - A carefully crafted, \"\"colorful\"\" world - A complex interrogation system - More than 30 unique, fully voiced characters - A cinematic film-noir-like experience with more than 20 cutscenes! - Lots of clues, information, and collectibles to find - A beautiful original soundtrack If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

To put the car in the garage, after starting the game, open the blueprint menu, go to the \u201cPacks\u201d tab, select the desired armoured car and press the \u201cAssemble\u201d button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases up to 60. Attention! Storage overflow is possible under certain conditions. Buying the pack also gives early access to some factional structural parts. These parts become available immediately upon purchase and are not handed out again upon reaching the appropriate reputation level. Some parts are one-of-a-kind, and players can only own one copy of such parts. When simultaneously buying a standard and deluxe pack the constructional parts and portraits are not duplicated. Unique portraits are an excellent opportunity to stand out among survivors. Paint cans are a way to make your armoured car unlike the others. Coins \u2014 is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention! When buying multiple packs, the acquired coins stack!","SaleStarted":"2023-05-28","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202010/2011/dRmvWGQipQdgtREFQK7TSIPK.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4432-CUSA06859_00-EB00560000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Simulation, Unique","PlusPrice":149.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202010/2011/dRmvWGQipQdgtREFQK7TSIPK.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Crossout - \u201cPhantom\u201d Pack","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Gaijin Distribution KFT","ReleaseDate":"2020-10-26","Slug":"crossout--phantom-pack-ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":299,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":149.5,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-12","description":"This is the ultimate Battlefield V experience.

Passive Co-Op Multiplayer As you adventure through Ashen, you'll occasionally encounter other players in a massive open world, akin to the passive multiplayer of Journey. It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore them. Souls with a Twist Ashen is faithful to the 'souls' genre of stamina-based combat, introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world.
