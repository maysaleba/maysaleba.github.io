That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like, but with persistent upgrades, and persistent heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your inheritance, grow the family manor, and give your children a better fighting chance. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. One daughter could be vampiric Ranger, while another could be a vegan Chef. It\u2019s a new experience every time. RL2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until you\u2019re ready for greater challenges. WHAT\u2019S NEW IN 2 Every Adventure is Unique New monsters, traps, and layouts await you every time you enter the Kingdom. This is a world where improvisation, not memorization, is the key to success. Wildly New Classes No two classes play the same. Hide atop Ivy Canopies as the Ranger and rain poisoned arrows down on your foes. Take to the skies as a Dragon Lancer, striking enemies at massive speeds. Or sing and dance through danger as the joyous Bard. RL2 supports 15 new classes, with 15 distinct styles of play. Brand New Style Rogue Legacy 2 features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops. The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar Rogue Legacy look and feel. Revamped Biome Generation Biome generation in RL2 will feel completely new, as each biome adopts different \u201cbuild strategies\u201d to create completely unique randomly-generated regions. True Metroidvania To really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities and fundamentally change the way you play. Prove your worth, provided you can uncover the many heirlooms. Traits 2.0 Though fun the first time, traits in RL1 often wore their welcome later in the game. We\u2019ve now added gold modifiers to entice players to take on new challenges. The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward. This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time. Relics and Resolve One of the most exciting new features to Rogue Legacy 2 is the ability to pick up Relics, which are unique items that change how your run is played. Gain stat modifiers, complete special challenges, and even gain brand new abilities as you traverse the kingdom. But be careful, the more Relics you obtain the more your resolve is shaken, and all Relics are lost if your hero perishes. Improved Accessibility Rogue Legacy 2 takes accessibility to the next level with the introduction of House Rules. Toggle contact damage, tweak global damage and health, and even give yourself flight for difficult platform sections. You have complete control over how you want to play the game. Also introduced are new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed. Rich Narrative & New Game+ Beating the game once is only the beginning. Learn about the inevitable collapse of a once-thriving kingdom, and discover the dark secrets of the ones responsible, while you connect and build relationships with the characters you meet along the way. The new and expanded lore to RL2 runs deep as you continue to explore and discover multiple playthroughs in NG+. Choose how the game gets harder, from unique biome hazards, to special boss fights. The experience keeps changing for near infinite replayability. More of Everything The sequel adds more of everything people loved from the original Rogue Legacy. More traits, spells, classes, biomes, enemies, equipment, rooms, story. More secrets... Just more everything.","SaleStarted":"2023-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/80560","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2315/370f9bc417f347c5e73fbdda450758ea4b04022d234b0e28.png?w=200","MainStory":26,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4488-PPSA15173_00-0338975894246736","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yi1pXd9AyY","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":120,"genre":"Action, Adventure, Role Playing Games","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2315/370f9bc417f347c5e73fbdda450758ea4b04022d234b0e28.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/rogue-legacy-2/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","Title":"Rogue Legacy 2","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Cellar Door Games","ReleaseDate":"2023-06-20","Slug":"rogue-legacy-2-ps4&ps5-us","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/1fsv0noS7X","IsPS5":1,"Price":24.99,"MainExtra":41,"SalePrice":16.24,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"90","SaleEnds":"2024-01-06","description":"Escape into a fun and beautiful world filled with the best mini golf courses you\u2019ve ever seen!

Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.","SaleStarted":"2023-12-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0318/6e4c1a9bea5d06b549bdd4e0ed67c3ab9837c643da774614.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2470-PPSA15801_00-KRZPS5SIEA000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0_n9QPves4","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Adventure, Unique","PlusPrice":12.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0318/6e4c1a9bea5d06b549bdd4e0ed67c3ab9837c643da774614.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Title":"Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Annapurna Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2023-08-17","Slug":"kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-ps4&ps5-us","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/2flSBc6IxU","IsPS5":1,"Price":24.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":12.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"88","SaleEnds":"2024-01-06","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PlayStation®VR version and the digital PlayStation®VR2 version of this game.

Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective. In the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbor has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbor is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer. In the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town.

Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals.

Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESS™ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die\u2026 a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again.

Cave Digger 2 is a 1-4-player action-adventure game set in wildland valleys, where you discover old mines, nautical caves, and ruins of ancient civilizations inspired by Western, Dieselpunk and Lovecraftian themes. Explore the \"pristine\" lands, loot its riches, and unravel the mystery linked to a great explorer. As you go, it's best to keep a six-shooter nearby just in case. Tools and Progression Get thrown right away into the deep end by being stuck in the mines as your drill machine broke. With a single pickaxe, work your way to the surface camp where your journey can begin in earnest. Your goal is simply to mine and carry loot back to the surface the best you can for your mission assigners. With the surplus reward that you get, you can buy new things like upgrading your dependable pickaxe with a shinier look! (And faster digging rate.) Or buy dynamites that work on pretty much anything that needs to be worked on. Maybe you fancy a shovel that works for both digging and moving through the caves like a spider-miner. Whatever your preferred loadout, you will be ready to go deeper into the ever-shifting caves than any miner before or after you! Story The valleys have their mysteries and they hide them well. Step by step the player follows the same path where a great explorer has once wandered. Who is this hardy explorer? Why did he come to these valleys? And where is he now? The answers to these and more lie in the depths of the valleys. The story has multiple endings, each revealing a different side of it. Find the scattered comic pages to a tale of greed, eldritch power, and secrets beyond space and time. Who the wanderer is and why he did what he did in the valleys become clear in the end, but is it really the end? Co-op Multiplayer Gather a party of up to 4 players.

The unsettling environment is a character itself. Every location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world.

A seemingly simple quest to reclaim it begins to pull at the fraying threads of this strange world, unraveling a mystery and reality in the process. Go on a trip through the doors of perception. Explore fantastical environments in the hunt for the pinched limb. Play hide and seek with animate mushrooms in the forest, win carnival prizes, and race go-karts against colorful characters like mages, sentient save points, robots, and vampires. Learn about Red's past and come ever-closer to finding the Absolute Truths of the Universe. But knowledge often comes at a cost. Some of Everhood's eclectic residents aren't content to let Red roam the realm freely. Face off against challengers ranging from multi-legged monsters to brothers who run a plank-selling business, and the fearsome Gold Pig, in musical battles. Avoid incoming attacks by moving, grooving, and leaping out of harm's way while jamming out to bespoke battle themes as varied as the inhabitants of this curious community. Red's journey is teeming with secrets and world-alerting revelations. As Everhood's true nature begins to appear, adventurers will make decisions that impact Red's role in the fate of everyone \u2013 and everything \u2013 the doll encounters. Experience a twisting story and overcome dance-based trials across five difficulty modes, a range of accessibility options, and an unlockable New Game Plus feature that calls into question everything that's come before it.","SaleStarted":"2023-12-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0912/44b5e5fa42db6b7623f5681d2cf2a43dccda9426555c84a4.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP7654-PPSA09759_00-EVERHOOD000PS5NA","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":"","genre":"Adventure, Music/Rhythm","PlusPrice":9.74,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0912/44b5e5fa42db6b7623f5681d2cf2a43dccda9426555c84a4.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Everhood: Eternity Edition","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"BlitWorks Publishing, S.L.","ReleaseDate":"2023-09-28","Slug":"everhood-eternity-edition-ps4&ps5-us","IsPS5":1,"Price":12.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":9.74,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-01-06","description":"✦ \"AFTERDREAM is simply one of the best retro horror games that I have played in years if not decades \u2013 Well done Jesse Makkonen.\" - Tony Aksnes ✦ \"In short, this is the best game yet from the developer and one to add to your list.\" - Vulgar Knight Get lost in a lucid dream, bending the lines between reality and fiction.

Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That\u2019s what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience without equal. Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew\u2019s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement. The Tightest Crew The legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. Ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, one born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake. In order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan. Give in to your greed Give outlet to your greed and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash and jewelry and any other valuables they might come across, you\u2019ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics and accolades. It won\u2019t be as simple as showing up and gaining goodies. You\u2019ll have to work hard and plan smart to get away with as much loot as possible. Gain experience, unlock new skills and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges. The Art of Heisting A professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays. Thrive in Co-op Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends in mind, whether you bring them from your childhood or make them along the road. The PAYDAY-series has always valued the bonds made through hardship and tries to reflect that in the actions and words of our heisters while in the game, and through our community while on the outside.","SaleStarted":"2023-12-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2909/a1a027289fadb563ddc04c1a3ec0f2b7f4f9f8dd7fe378c2.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP8268-PPSA14410_00-PAYDAY3GOLDSIEA0","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":67.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2909/a1a027289fadb563ddc04c1a3ec0f2b7f4f9f8dd7fe378c2.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"PAYDAY 3: Gold Edition","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"PLAION","ReleaseDate":"2023-09-21","Slug":"payday-3-gold-edition-ps5-us","IsPS5":1,"Price":89.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":67.49,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-01-06","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4® version and the digital PS5® version of this game.

Starting with a small cast of survivors, you\u2019ll chart a path to reach your ultimate destination, encountering threats, including zombies, raiders, and even zombie raiders! Along the way you will need to recruit a ragtag band of heroes to protect your growing community and fight your way forward. Discovering how to best utilize each hero's unique abilities is the key to success in Days of Doom\u2019s turn-based combat. Attack with Pyro early in the battle, as he ignites enemies for lasting damage. Then combine the Hydromancer and the Thrasher in a one-two knockout punch. Hydromancer can set the stage with a ranged water attack, and then the Thrasher can deliver a shocking surprise to wet enemies. The odds against you may seem insurmountable, but if you use your heroes' abilities strategically, upgrade them, and add new abilities along the way, you might just make it. No two runs are ever the same, which keeps you at the top of your game, and makes Days of Doom inherently replayable.

Tackle challenging encounters with your party of two characters, using a variety of skills and highly interactive environments. Maybe you'll light an enemy on fire and kick them into a grain field for a proper barbeque, or set up a trap and fell a tree on top of them. The options are endless, and you're the one in charge! You have control over time The core of Iron Danger is its unique time control mechanic. You can rewind time up to 5 seconds whenever you want, trying different strategies and combinations of moves until you find the right one for the task at hand. The time manipulation allows us to combine real-time combat gameplay with controls from more traditional, tactical turn-based combat games. This gives tactical combat a puzzle-like element, as you can keep trying new approaches to turn impossible odds to your advantage and synchronize the actions of your characters for the perfect outcome. You will die, but you will not fail! Iron Danger is set in a world of lofty fells, primeval forest, and placid lakes...as well as living gods and monsters of steel. The city of Kalevala, home of the humans who rebelled against the gods and forsook their protection, shines in the middle of this world, surrounded by towns, sea lanes and woodlands under its protection. But from the frozen north, a witch queen is leading her army on a quest for vengeance against the lords of Kalevala. Ancient ruins from the days when gods dwelled on the earth are opening to unleash forgotten powers, tempting humans and striving to overtake the world.

The gameplay combines many different types of puzzles from more and less famous puzzle games and takes them to a whole new perspective. After the recent war, engineers from Epsilon Energy created the Split indestructible shield system. It was to protect individual giant cities covering almost the entire planet from armed conflicts. Different cities have different policies for their citizens. In West Ulrage, every citizen gets a guardian robot at birth. In Hal'Tor, pairs of robots raise several children each. Whereas in Dievez, people are raised in large centers. Most jobs have been taken over by machines. People work mainly as mechanics, programmers, or operators. The Split control panel is riddled with numerous traps that will require both good reflexes and composure. You can try to destroy enemies or escape from them by using time manipulation and your own clones to distract them. The game's design refers to Brutalism, an architectural style popular around the 1970s. It was promoted, among others, by the game \"Control\". We mixed this style with the digital environment from \"Tron: Legacy\". The levels are full of nooks and crannies, which may seem empty at first glance, but lead to interesting places. We were inspired by games such as: Q.U.B.E.2\u201d, \u201cThe Talos Principle\u201d, \u201cThe Turing Test\u201d, \u201cPortal\u201d, \u201cThe Witness\u201d and \u201cAntichamber\u201d","SaleStarted":"2023-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/41816","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0613/98eb73faf8779ccb18896083254a3c26bf0721a46b13204c.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP8381-CUSA43173_00-0680674308660444","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":4,"genre":"Action, Puzzle","PlusPrice":4.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0613/98eb73faf8779ccb18896083254a3c26bf0721a46b13204c.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Split","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"FreeMind S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2023-07-07","Slug":"split-ps4-us","IsPS5":0,"Price":9.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":4.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-01-06","description":"Set in a creepy and melancholic world, GYLT is an eerie story mixing fantasy and reality in a surrealist place where your nightmares become reality.

To maintain security, Earth imposes martial law, but a federation of colonies led by the colony of Secilia overthrows the Earth\u2019s government and plans to obliterate the planet and all the people on it.

Fighter jets, tanks, and battleships have entered the war, and giants known as Guardians and Mugen are tearing their way through the battlefield. This is the exciting stage of Akai Katana Shin, a horizontal shoot 'em up game. The Japanese-inspired military game visuals and gorgeous character designs portray a dramatic story of clashes between family and old friends. These elements are tied together by strategic game mechanics, which feature a wide variety of attack methods to experiment with. Find out for yourself why this game has such a strong base of ardent fans! Contains Three Titles From Cave's Akai Katana Series Akai Katana The first arcade game of the series released in 2010. Supports two players. Akai Katana Shin A home console version with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and new game features such as Hagane and Katana. Akai Katana Zetsu Based on Akai Katana with an aspect ratio of 16:9. Game mechanics have been adjusted for balance. From Strategy Crafting to Score Attack\u2014Versatile Enough to Play It Your Way The player unit known as Fighter can switch between its normal form and a giant ninja known as Guardian using Soul-shift. The unit also comes equipped with two different bullet shots. Attack Mode has more power and Defense Mode boosts mobility. Make good use of a combination of forms and modes to break through enemy ranks and destroy them. Soul-shift is a crucial technique that boosts the player for a short while. In Akai Katana and Akai Katana Zetsu, timing the shift well can block enemy bullets even on a screen that's full of them. In Akai Katana Shin, generate and fire a Katana shot to quickly defeat strong enemies. The highlight of this title is the ability to negate or dispel attacks instead of simply avoiding them. Make good use of Soul-shift to turn the tide in your favor and earn a higher score. Quality Game Modes Packed With Features Settings: Adjust options such as sound volume and screen display.

The Dreadshore Arsenal Pack contains: \u202f 1 CUSTODIAN:\u202f - Nautilus Enhance the effects of defensive weaponry and increase your odds of survival against any onslaught. This armor, resembling an ancient diving suit, was developed in secret by the only prisoner to escape the lighthouse Sanctuary. Nautilus, a terror from the depths who came to drown the last of humanity. 1 TRAP:\u202f -Sentry Beam This trap was developed by the lighthouse Sanctuary to swiftly execute any prisoner bold enough to pursue escape. The Sentry Beam\u2019s watchful red eye uses motion-tracking to lock onto a target and emit a narrow laser beam of super-heated amplified light \u2013 perfect for slicing through fast-moving Raiders. Should the beam miss its mark, it ricochets multiple times offering additional opportunity for a chaotic, blistering kill. 1 GUARD:\u202f -Ravager Both ruthless brute and precise killer, the Ravager is a disturbing result of the lighthouse Sanctuary\u2019s failed cloning experiments.

Based on the rider selected, playing and controlling your rider is now different. It's easier to reach maximum speed and to take certain trajectories tightly with a rider like Wout van Aert than with Primož Roglič. But be careful, because the lower the Downhill and Agility ratings of your cyclist, the more control you need! STAND OUT FROM OTHER RIDERS To add more immersion to the core of Tour de France 2023, we added two new bibs this year. You can now see and wear the \"\"super combative\"\" bib and the best team bib. Prove you deserve to wear these distinctions by showing your panache! As in real life, riders can form a \"\"grupetto\"\" to make a breakaway or if they have fallen behind. This helps to limit damage during difficult stages and conserve energy for future stages or the end of the race. SMOOTHER RACES In Tour de France 2023, trajectories and collisions have been redesigned so you can navigate within the peloton more easily. Thanks to these improvements, you can reposition yourself more easily and prepare for the end of the race as ideally as possible. All ratings have been updated based on the results of the riders' last season so that they reflect reality and the latest performances of professional cyclists. The Race of the Moment mode has also been updated with new challenges, races and optimisations that add more variety.

It\u2019s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance. Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection! Dogs need a place to call home, and it\u2019s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you\u2019d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most! The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects. Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it\u2019s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that\u2019s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space. These dogs try their best, but sometimes they need a bit of extra help!","SaleStarted":"2023-12-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/0814/u8g6usyPNiBjzh3KNk6Y5KWv.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP7076-CUSA35706_00-WOBBLEDOGSWOBBLE","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Simulation, Casual, Unique","PlusPrice":9.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/0814/u8g6usyPNiBjzh3KNk6Y5KWv.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Wobbledogs Console Edition","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Secret Mode Limited","ReleaseDate":"2023-05-23","Slug":"wobbledogs-console-edition-ps4-us","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":9.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-01-06","description":"Experience the Riot Bundle, featuring the all-new Riot Mode, new animations showcasing lethal kills, and an exciting new cosmetic collection.

Micro Challenge brings an entire new take on the unique puzzle series by adding new player movement options and new terrain tiles. Whether you are a fan of the series or a first time player, this is the perfect place to start. Micro Challenge is a uniquely set up movement based puzzle game, and your goal is to examine each level and determine the most efficient route possible to collect all items before reaching the move limit. Like in previous entries your Player Tile can Move, Double Slide, Diagonal Slide, Tilt, and Teleport. Micro Challenge also adds the ability to change sizes. Shrink your tile down to fit through narrow hallways and corridors. Be careful when you are small as there are now towers filled with holes, and if you try to traverse them while in the shrunken state, you will fall to your demise! It costs 1 energy unit to shrink or to grow. This creates an entire new style of puzzle design in which you must determine when it's most beneficial to change sizes in your route planning. Micro Challenge features the ability for the Tile to become \"micro\" but it is ALSO a \"micro\" sized Tilting Tiles game. Micro Challenge is designed to be a perfect starting point for the franchise. It features 20 unique levels and 5 creative multiplayer maps! Not only does Micro Challenge feature a focused and unique single player puzzle set, it also contains a series first, with the all new Tilting Tiles Multiplayer Mode. Grab a friend and solve your way through Tilting Tiles Maps together. Both players share a move count, so you must examine the level together and determine who can collect which items more efficiently. Each player is given a different set of problems to solve as well as a different amount of special moves available.

Bolster your party with a reliable brawler, capable of taking on the aspects of various wild beasts. Delve into the lost secrets of Old Sarkoris. And who knows? Maybe you will even find new love, one transcending time itself. DLC #5 This new standalone campaign picks up where the \u201cThrough the Ashes\u201d story left off. A new demon lord with hordes of frozen minions is emerging from the depths of the Abyss. With the Knight Commander busy elsewhere, what can a group of regular adventurers with no mythic powers do to save the day? This expansion offers a 6-7 hourlong story which you can play independently or with the hero from your \u201cThrough the Ashes\u201d savegame. And when you're done, a whole new dungeon in the main campaign will be open for the Knight Commander to explore. DLC #6 During your first visit to Kenabres, things did not go well. Now that the demonic assault has been thwarted, and the crusaders are preparing their final counterattack, why not take a little break? Kenabres, burned and rebuilt, is holding a new festival, and the Knight Commander will be the guest of honor.

Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

Lend a hand \u2014 literally \u2014 so that everything can grow and thrive. Sow, water and harvest your own plants. Raise adorable baby animals. Milk the cows, shear the sheep and go on a truffle hunt with the pigs \u2014 all in fun mini- and micro-games. The graphics in Across the Valley have a fantastic hand-drawn style. The grass here is lush and green, and the sunsets are golden. Enjoy the idyllic countryside and relax to the sounds of the atmospheric soundtrack. On your farm, there\u2019s something to do every day. Give your plants and animals plenty of love and care! They\u2019ll reward you with a bountiful harvest. You can use your profits to expand your farm \u2014 your planning table will let you see it all easily. Features: Action Point Locomotion System: * No Motion Sickness! With the action point locomotion system, no artificial movement is done! * Each action point is designed carefully to have everything you need within the reach of your hands. * Like: Everything you need to shear a sheep is right at the shearing station within your hand\u2019s reach. * Or: Everything you need to work on the fields is at the tool spot. All tools are in reach of your hands. * You can get to an action point with just a blink of an eye. No button learning: * Do everything with your own hands. No extensive button learning is needed. * To dig up a field, take a shovel with you and grab it with two hands. Then dig the field up like you would in the real world. * To sow out seeds, just grab a seed bowl, grab some seeds from it and throw them on the field. Automatic Micro Games: * Instead of typical minigames that interrupt the game, Across the Valley automatically starts and stops a microgame when you perform an action. * An example: Sowing out seeds will automatically start a \u201cseeding\u201d micro-game when the first seed hits the field. The better you distribute the seeds, the more plants grow. Once the seed basket is empty, the microgame finishes and your plants start growing.

Overcome all of these and many more fiendish challenges as you follow intriguing stories of heroes and villains to their conclusions. This product contains all three games in the series, and although they share a setting and atmosphere, the three stories are not related directly, so can be played in any order.

The voices they hear will help them identify potential suspects and solve the mysteries. What is it that\u2019s connecting seemingly unrelated cases? This edition also contains \"The Lethal Script\" case that will have the detectives investigating a movie industry mystery on The Peak Hotel. Put on your headphones and step back into the past. Use the voices you hear to return to crime scenes, tracking down each individual involved and solving the cases. But where do the voices come from? Can you trust what you hear? And what's the mysterious thread weaving all of these cases together? A Unique Case-Solving Experience Discover the truth hidden in the voices from the past. Step through time as you use our device to eavesdrop on conversations from past crime scenes. Every clue, every move, and every motive will be presented in the form of audio. Rather than controlling any one character, you only need listen to their conversations, following along as the story evolves. Use the information you hear to match names to voices and determine how everything (and everyone) is related. Can you discover the truth? Open-Ended Narrative Mystery Game Explore the story and piece together the puzzle in your own way! Don't expect to be \"fed\" a pile of clues.

Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin\u2019s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind\u2019s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra\u2019s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra\u2019s discoveries as she learns more about her family\u2019s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra\u2019s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player\u2019s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra\u2019s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn\u2019t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE\u2019s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE\u2019s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a.

You have to perform increasingly complex tasks in prison, balancing the administration's assessment and inmates' satisfaction. In the game, you play the role of a prison guard and it is only up to you whether you decide to obey the law or let this place and people corrupt you completely. After all, who said you had to be an exemplary ranger? Maybe you prefer to trade with prisoners, help them smuggle, and bet on the outcome of fights in prison instead? After all, everyone likes to have fun sometimes. Especially in a sad place like this, where you are also the boss. Or at least you think so. So how? Will you choose to follow the rules, intercept contraband, count prisoners, send them to work, take care of their basic needs and keep prison gangs under control? Will you go to the dark side? Whatever you decide, remember that your actions will affect both the facility itself and the inmates, and above all, the further course of your career. Unique features of the game: - try to balance between following the orders of your superiors and doing small favors for the inmates. In doing so, you will maintain a fragile balance between both and benefit from the gratitude of both parties, - become the exemplary prison guard in campaign mode. Receive new prisoners, search cells for contraband for confiscation, view surveillance footage, maintain peace and order, react to inmates' acts of disobedience, and complete many other tasks assigned by your superiors, - or ignore all rules in Free Play mode. Do what you want, discover the farthest corners of the prison, explore the surroundings and interact with prisoners.
