In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness. The game\u2019s cutscenes, quirky cast of characters, and the majestic Pacific Northwest vistas have been enhanced for an experience that delivers as much on its visual impact as its unnerving atmosphere.

Something Evil Lurks at Winterlake While investigating the disappearance of twin girls at Winterlake, something terrible happens to Caroline Walker. Waking in the dead of night, naked and hooked up to some kind of outdated medical equipment in a bathtub, Caroline must fight for her life as she explores the halls of the abandoned mansion.

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that\u2014but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock\u2019s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal\u2014your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It\u2019s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you\u2019re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you\u2019ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We\u2019ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend\u2014now you\u2019re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there\u2019s something to be said for style\u2014and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It\u2019s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good\u2014and how that will shape the man you\u2019ll become.","SaleStarted":"2023-02-15","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5025-PPSA01979_00-SHCOFROGWARESUAK","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZXfOVX4J10","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Adventure","PlusPrice":17.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/sherlock-holmes-chapter-one","Title":"Sherlock Holmes Chapter One","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-16","Slug":"sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":44.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":31.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2023-03-02","description":"A delightfully cute action adventure RPG with farming and crafting - Armed with sword, bow and spellbook, fight against a rising darkness threatening the world.

That\u2019s right \u2013 we\u2019re doing this again. The baa has been raised, and Pilgor is joined by other goats too. You can invite up to three friends in local or online co-op, create carnage as a team, or compete in mini-games and then not be friends anymore. Get ready for another round of udder mayhem. Lick, headbutt, and ruin your way through a brand new open world in the biggest waste of your time since Goat Simulator! We won\u2019t tell you how to play (except in the tutorial), but merely provide the means to be the goats of your dreams. KEY FEATURES: - You can be a goat - Three of your friends can be goats too, and join you in local or online co-op - No really, there are so many goats. If you want to be fancy you can wear the skins of tall goats, stripey goats, and many more. There\u2019s a goat for everyone! - Or dress up your goat in all kinds of nonsense, from toilet rolls to tea trays.

Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages. The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible. Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences. As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain. A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre.

Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in. Cure unusual illnesses!

Build libraries, hire the best staff, kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked! But it\u2019s not just work hard. Oh, no.

The T-126 experimental light tank was built in the summer of 1940 at Leningrad Experimental Automobile Factory #185. The project was developed on the basis of combat experience in Spain with the goal of creating a tank suitable for the conditions of future wars. Only one model of the tank was ever built, and it was never used in combat. The T-126 featured sloping armour, torsion bar suspension, diesel engine, three-man turret, and a commander's cupola, all of which were advanced features at the time. The tank is equipped with a 45 mm 20-K cannon and a 7.62 mm DT machine gun. It is a premium version of the T-50, being its prototype design, it shares it similarities, but actually is better due to much thicker armour all around. Zhukovsky's Chaika is a distinctive vehicle in mainly appearance. It performs very well and can take bombs and rockets into battle. With a forward armament of 4 x 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns, it can quite quickly ruin enemy planes, and its payload options allow it to deal with a couple lightly armoured vehicles while it's over the battlefield. Besides that, Chaika can be equipped with rockets and bombs. It is best used as an air superiority aircraft. Due to its fast climb rate, tight turning radius, and speed, it outperforms many of its contemporaries. The plane is painted after the camouflage scheme of Soviet pilot Sergey Y. Zhukovsky in the 127th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the Soviet Air Forces. All premium vehicles allow you to earn increased Research Points and Silver Lions and comes furnished with all available modifications. With a Premium account (also purchasable in the game for Golden Eagles) you will earn more Research Points and Silver Lions in battles for a set amount of days.

France, 1944 \u2013 As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. EXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission.

With less ammo around, the Resistance of Östertörn have started building their own weapons to keep fighting the machine invasion. Despite their more makeshift nature, these new weapons are proving to be both efficient and deadly. Mid-tier versions of these three resistance weapons can be found in the PLUNDRA storage box in Östertörn. If this is your first time playing the game, you will find them in the storage box at the Iboholmen Church. Higher tier versions of the weapons can also be found by taking the fight to the machines and looting the weapons from their wreckage. These weapons are: \u2022 Resistance Pitchfork - At first glance it could be dismissed as a simple farmer\u2019s tool, but this pitchfork has been reinforced and transformed into an effective Resistance weapon. The pitchfork has excellent reach, which is great for doing damage from a safer distance. \u2022 Resistance Heavy Bow - Built using scavenged machine parts, this heavy bow packs a powerful punch, but requires more skill to use. The enhanced power of the bow also allows it to fire heavy, modified arrows, making this a versatile tool. \u2022 Resistance Flamethrower - While it may look like an accident waiting to happen, the flamethrower's powerful napalm fuel causes massive damage to machines by sticking to them while it burns, quickly melting its vulnerable internal parts. Special weapon ammo and attachments include: \u2022 Resistance Standard Arrow - A regular arrow that does a lot of damage to components but is weak against armor. \u2022 Resistance Explosive Arrow - A special type of arrow that explodes on impact, dealing extra explosive damage to its target. \u2022 Resistance Flare Arrow - An arrow with an emergency flare attached. The lit flare will lure any enemy's attention and fire away from you and onto the flare, even if that flare is now pinned to another machine. \u2022 3-Pin Makeshift Bow Sight - This 3-Pin Bow sight features three pins calibrated to hit at a certain distance, working best when the distance to the target is known. \u2022 Large Flamethrower Tank - A larger tank that can hold more fuel, letting you relentlessly melt enemy machines for longer without needing to refuel.","SaleStarted":"2023-02-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2910/QAUfPaFQ3zo3RYLNLTbJOXjw.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5259-CUSA12260_00-RESISTANCEWEAPON","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Adventure","PlusPrice":2.39,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2910/QAUfPaFQ3zo3RYLNLTbJOXjw.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Generation Zero® - Resistance Weapons Pack","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Systemic Reaction AB","ReleaseDate":"2022-05-12","Slug":"generation-zero--resistance-weapons-pack-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":3.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":2.79,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-03-09","description":"Discover historical Volkan Machines equipment crafted for world-class soldiers, and enjoy their unique design in Harran!

Dalis Rhyme, a meteorological scientist, who devoted his life to studying the north, was hardened not only by the cold. As a young man, by a twist of fate, he found himself in the far North. He fell in love with this region and decided to settle down to explore it. In a small fishing village Dalis found his future wife, and together they built a research station and raised their daughter. Even Crossout didn\u2019t affect their lives much and didn\u2019t disconnect them from science, forcing them only to be more concerned about provisions. But during one of their expeditions, Dalis and his wife ventured very far into the permafrost territory. They decided to spend the night in a cave at the foot of a giant mountain range, where they stumbled upon indescribable organic specimens that were unknown to science. After that, Dalis lost consciousness. He came to his senses in the middle of a snowy forest. Having returned home and not finding his wife and daughter there, the man went searching to the only place where he had seen people in recent years \u2014 the Valley. The unique armoured car presented in the pack is known for its balance of weapons, combination of modules and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the \u201cPacks\u201d tab, select the desired armoured car and click the \u201cAssemble\u201d button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases up to 50. Attention! Storage overflow is possible under certain conditions. Buying the pack also gives early access to several structural parts. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy.

Most people live in megacities that rely on the labor of poor masses to sustain a modern standard of living for the few at the top. With the Earth scorched, water is liquid gold, and control of it is the truest form of power.

Until the day when that promising future is ripped away from her, leaving her half-dead and homeless, she becomes hellbent on taking down the system that ruined her and left her without a heart. Along the way she meets a diverse group of people sympathetic to her cause, every one with secrets of their own. With their help, perhaps she will find redemption, love, and most of all - vengeance.

Its distinguished crest helps intensify roars and aids communication between Monolophosauruses. OURANOSAURUS (Variant) The Ouranosaurus is a peaceful herbivore that lives in large herds. Keeping a single Ouranosaurus is not advised, as lone individuals have been known to break out of their enclosures and panic guests. The Ouranosaurus has a broad snout and tall spines on its back supporting a camel-like hump. KENTROSAURUS (Variant) Despite being covered in lethal-looking spikes, the Kentrosaurus is actually a docile herbivore that uses its beak to bite off plant material. One of the smallest species of stegosaur, the Kentrosaurus defends itself when threatened using long spikes on each shoulder and smaller spikes protruding from its hips and tail. 8 NEW DINOSAUR SKINS Bring the Baryonyx trio Grim, Limbo and Chaos, plus Toro the Carnotaurus, Bumpy the Ankylosaurus, and Big Eatie the Tyrannosaurus Rex to life in your parks, and entrance your guests with two glow-in-the-dark skins inspired by the Parasaurolophus Lux. · 1 Ankylosaurus skin - Bumpy · 3 Baryonyx skins - Grim, Limbo, Chaos · 1 Carnotaurus skin - Toro · 2 Parasaurolophus Lux skins - Lux 1 (glow in the dark), Lux 2 (glow in the dark) · 1 Tyrannosaurus rex skin - Big Eatie","SaleStarted":"2023-02-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2115/VlZzWssgw9IYJNxeFk6f82rW.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2514-PPSA03287_00-CAMPCRETACEOUSPK","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Simulation, Strategy","PlusPrice":5.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2115/VlZzWssgw9IYJNxeFk6f82rW.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Jurassic World Evolution 2: Camp Cretaceous Dinosaur Pack","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Frontier Developments PLC","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-08","Slug":"jurassic-world-evolution-2-camp-cretaceous-dinosaur-pack-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":9.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":5.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-03-09","description":"While the survivors of Östertörn have already managed to scavenge some US and Soviet weapons, NATO has decided it\u2019s time to broaden the arsenal even further, dropping another shipment of American weapons across the Resistance controlled territories. While this is still not enough to stave off the machine invasion, it should help the fighters tackle most situations and battles. Mid-tier versions of these three new US weapon models can be found in the PLUNDRA storage box in Östertörn. If this is your first time playing the game, you will find them in the storage box at the Iboholmen Church. Higher tier versions of the weapons can also be found by taking the fight to the machines and looting the weapons from their wreckage. These weapons are: \u2022 COM-10 SMG - The COM-10 is a high recoil yet very fast firing SMG that is sometimes used by the US army in special operations. \u2022 S21 - A sniper version of the classic S14 battle rifle with improved accuracy and adjustments to fit a scope mount. \u2022 G79 Grenade Launcher - The G79 was created by the US army to grant infantry an impressive mix of firepower, range and accuracy and at the same time achieve being more portable than a mortar. Weapon attachments included: \u2022 COM-10 Silencer - A unique silencer for the COM-10. Attaching this mod will significantly reduce the noise created by each shot. \u2022 COM-10 Extended Magazine - An extended magazine for the COM-10 SMG. Attaching this mod will increase the weapon's ammo capacity. \u2022 S21 Extended Magazine - An extended magazine for the S21. Attaching this mod will increase the weapon's ammo capacity. \u2022 G79 Smoke Grenade - A smoke-producing round that fits the G79 Grenade Launcher. This shell deals no damage but instead creates a smoke screen at the point of impact which hinders enemies' visual prowess. \u2022 G79 HE Grenade - A high-explosive round that fits the G79 Grenade Launcher. This low-velocity shell is capable of dealing moderate explosive damage to armored targets. \u2022 G79 EMP Grenade - A non-damaging, electromagnetic pulse round that fits the G79 Grenade Launcher. This shell, once detonated, is capable of knocking out all electronic devices within a short range for an extended period of time. Crafting schematics included: \u2022 G79 Smoke Grenade - Ammo crafting schematic that makes G79 Smoke Grenades. \u2022 G79 HE Grenade - Ammo crafting schematic that makes G79 HE Grenades. \u2022 G79 EMP Grenade - Ammo crafting schematic that makes G79 EMP Grenades.","SaleStarted":"2023-02-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/0415/1eqQOz6S3pEpRYCVJaPEe32V.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5259-CUSA12260_00-GZ0USWEAPONPACK2","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Adventure","PlusPrice":1.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/0415/1eqQOz6S3pEpRYCVJaPEe32V.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Generation Zero® - US Weapons Pack 2","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Systemic Reaction AB","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-08","Slug":"generation-zero--us-weapons-pack-2-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":2.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":1.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-03-02","description":"WHEN THE VALUE HITS THIS DEEP IT HITS DIFFERENT The WWE 2K22 Deluxe Edition includes: - Undertaker Immortal Pack: Get three additional Undertaker personas, MyFACTION EVO cards for Undertaker, plus MyFACTION Perks and Bonuses - Season Pass: Includes all five DLC content packs, the MyRISE Mega-Boost and SuperCharger packs - Starrcade '96 Rey Mysterio Pack: Includes a Starrcade \u201896 Rey Mysterio playable character and Starrcade \u201896 Rey Mysterio Ruby MyFACTION card REDESIGNED GAMEPLAY ENGINE.

Meet other survivors as you take on a new tier of enemies, discovering both new havens and foreign structures that don\u2019t bode well. ALPINE UNREST A month has passed since the events of the main game, and your search has led you to Himfjäll, an island off the east coast of Östertörn. Formerly a popular vacation spot for its towns, cafés, shops, and ski slopes, the island now stands abandoned. At the massive ski hotel Björntunet, you\u2019ll find something invaluable - a small community of survivors who have managed to stay alive despite chaos outside. Their situation is far from good though, as the enemy is constantly on the lookout, making it next to impossible to leave their hotel hideout. While the situation on Himfjäll is slightly more positive given the addition of new allies, you\u2019ve unfortunately encountered a new tier of machines - Apocalypse Class. Much deadlier than their counterparts you have stumbled upon in the past, they seem designed to hunt down those who are left, overpowering any who try to fight back. Their weapons are horrible creations, including things like biochemical machine guns and flamethrowers. Even the mainland of Östertörn has become more unsafe, as these machines have started making their way there. Hopefully the new machine guns you\u2019ve found during your exploration will be enough to take them down. FNIX RISING The struggle for survival continues as the year 1989 draws to a close. Hope for finding the missing population has started to dwindle, as you and your friends continue to do your best to stay away from the invading machines and scour abandoned buildings for weapons and equipment. However, recent scouting missions that you have conducted on your own and with friends have yielded some unexpected results - structures that appear to be made by the FNIX machines have started appearing along the Southern Coast of mainland Östertörn. Thankfully it seems that there are also survivors, scattered across both the Southern Coast, the Archipelago and Farmland regions, putting up resistance against the invaders. Whatever they are planning can\u2019t be good, and it seems that Apocalypse tier Harvesters have joined their ranks as well, using Biological Aerosol or even Dirty Missiles when you attempt to ambush them. Surviving won\u2019t be easy, but grabbing a brännboll bat or sledgehammer might be a good idea just to ensure that you are prepared for all scenarios, with or without ammo.","SaleStarted":"2023-02-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1214/8w36CZb4oMUFUFUAfkr7JMUh.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5259-CUSA12260_00-GZSTORYBUNDLE000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Adventure","PlusPrice":5.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1214/8w36CZb4oMUFUFUAfkr7JMUh.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Generation Zero® - Story Bundle","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Systemic Reaction AB","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-22","Slug":"generation-zero--story-bundle-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":11.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":5.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-03-02","description":"With the dawn of the internet the digital universe experienced exponential growth.

Soviet soldiers in small and specialized forces have been seen in the northern regions using moveable defenses to set up temporary camps. They seem to be fighting the machines, but does that make them allies, or do they have their own motives for entering Swedish territory? The budding Resistance in Östertörn has come across several dead Soviet soldiers, armed with specialized USSR weapons that can be of great use to the Resistance as they learn to use them in the fight against FNIX. Mid-tier versions of these three Soviet weapon models will be available in any PLUNDRA storage box in Östertörn. If you\u2019re new to the game, you will find them in the storage box at the Iboholmen Church. For the higher-tiered versions, you will have to take the fight to the machines and loot the weapons from their wreckage. These weapons are: \u2022 Kotenok Sniper Rifle - This iconic semi-automatic designated marksman rifle is one of the most common weapons in the USSR.

Rolling hills, temperate rainforests, and deciduous forests combine to create a microcosm of the entire South Island of New Zealand. Watch the landscape shift before your very eyes as you trek across this beautiful reserve. While hunters make their way here in search of Sika Deer, Chamois, and Feral Goats, Te Awaroa National Park has also seen an influx of tourism due to the movies recently filmed in the area. It\u2019ll be up to you and warden Kiri Taylor to ensure that no permanent damage is done to the splendour of the reserve, and that its native flora and fauna are preserved. TE AWAROA\u2019S FAUNA Tracking the numerous animals that roam Te Awaroa\u2019s stunningly diverse environments is a favorite among hunters. For some, it\u2019s the rush of stalking a prized Sika Deer in the beech forest that draws them here, while others come in hopes of catching a rare glimpse of the Feral Pigs, Feral Goats, and Chamois. And for those looking for a more relaxed experience, there\u2019s plenty of Red Deer, Turkey, European Rabbits and Fallow Deer to hunt. THE NEW ZEALAND FLORA It\u2019s of no surprise that Te Awaroa has been used to depict fairytale landscapes, as it's ever-changing ecosystems are truly a sight to behold. From the steep, impressive mountains that divide the reserve, to the sparkling beaches and dense temperate forests, the region transforms under your very feet. There are also more familiar hunting grounds available, such as spruce and pine forests. VERSATILE SURPLUS RIFLE What the F.L. Sporter .303 lacks in condition, it more than makes up for in performance. The bolt action is smooth, reliable and easy to cycle, and it\u2019s a proven rifle for both hunting and target practice. With a wide selection of compatible sights, and a great effective range, it can take down a broad selection of animals without problem. MISSIONS AND MEASURES Stretching across a vast 25 square miles (64 square kilometers), Te Awaroa National Park has always been a place to get away from it all, both for the first Polynesian settlers and the hardy men who made their names hunting deer from helicopters. Times are tough though, and when warden Kiri Taylor reluctantly agrees to allow a series of Hollywood films to be made in the reserve, it goes from sleepy backwater to daytripper hotspot almost overnight. Now, with the reserve's delicate ecology threatened, Kiri has had enough. With you at her side, she\u2019s going to show the world that New Zealand isn\u2019t all just haka and halflings. Across 16 new story missions, you\u2019ll deal with local menaces, patch things up between old friends, and discover the truth behind a long-forgotten legend. SHARE THE EXPERIENCE You\u2019re able to hunt in Te Awaroa National Park even if you don\u2019t own the DLC by joining someone in multiplayer who does. This will give you access to everything except the narrative missions.","SaleStarted":"2023-02-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/2512/x0VzoSFmxZZHlwvtOWWMdNJn.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3501-CUSA08661_00-THCOTWTEAWAROA00","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Sports","PlusPrice":3.19,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/2512/x0VzoSFmxZZHlwvtOWWMdNJn.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"theHunter: Call of the Wild™ - Te Awaroa National Park","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Expansive Worlds AB","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-17","Slug":"thehunter-call-of-the-wild--te-awaroa-national-park-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":7.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":3.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-03-09","description":"To have your trophy claimed by the Valkyrie Predator was seen as a great honor, said to guarantee your passage to Valhalla.

As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future.

When proof was obtained that there were survivors hiding in multiple locations in Östertörn, resolution \"Reaction: Phase 1\" was passed at NATO, as an urgent, temporary solution: large quantities of standard-issue weapons used in the American military were to be dropped all over Östertörn, in order to offer immediate assistance and support to the various groups of survivors. Mid-tier versions of these three US weapons will now be available in any PLUNDRA storage box on Östertörn; if you are new to the game, you will find them in the storage box at the Iboholmen Church. Higher tier versions of the weapons can also be found by defeating and looting enemies. These weapons are: N9 Handgun - A proven, medium-power 9mm semi-automatic pistol. Standard-issue pistol for the US Army. Good for short-range encounters and as a last resort when your main weapon runs dry. N16 Assault Rifle - Standard-issue assault rifle for the US Army.

N60 Machine Gun - The N60 is a powerful and stable general-purpose machine gun used by the US Army since the late 1950s.

Welcome to Gehenna, a brutal frontier planet at the outskirts of space. You've come to the town of Vestige in hopes of collecting a bounty on The Devil Riders, a violent gang of beast-riding mercenaries. Only the scrappiest folks have managed to survive out here - like Rose, a tough-as-nails warrior who's as keen with a katana as a pistol, and Juno, a rugged brawler most locals call The Hatchet. To take down The Devil Riders, you'll need to learn new tricks to survive Gehenna. Indigenous plants and experiments left behind by a mysterious company open up new approaches to combat and exploration. The new Jetbeast vehicle acts as your trusty steed, a customizable hoverbike. All the while, an enigmatic narrator recounts the details of your rough-and-tumble heroics. Grab your six-shooter - or whatever fancy guns you Vault Hunters carry these days - and go put those damned Devil Riders in the ground.

However, she was kicked out by Yoshimitsu, the head of the Manji Clan, since she repeatedly stole for her own benefit. Later on, she tried to steal the sword called \u201cYoshimitsu\u201d from Yoshimitsu for her grandfather, who was a swordsmith. In the end, she was unable to steal the sword, and her grandfather passed away. She lost all desire to steal the sword, and vanished from Yoshimitsu\u2019s sight. Later on, she married a shinobi, and was blessed with a daughter. As time went on, her daughter grew to be a better ninja than her parents. She took on the name Kunimitsu from her sick mother, and accepted contracts from various governments and large corporations to steal important items. One day, Kunimitsu got a call that her mother\u2019s condition had worsened. She rushed to see her bedridden mother and heard the story of the only thing that her mother could not obtain in the past. Kunimitsu was then determined to obtain the sword to cheer her mother up. \u2022 DLC17: New stage Vermilion Gates!

Lidia has shown a keen interest in karate from childhood, and also politics, after the loss of her father, himself a political leader. She appears adept at both, entering and winning her first karate world championship at 18, and getting elected to office in her first campaign at 21. After a while, the war initiated by the Mishima Zaibatsu began to greatly affect Poland. Responding to growing demand from the public for a new, stronger political leader and a staunch response, she stepped forward to become Prime Minister of Poland at the young age of 29. After her inauguration, she immediately reponded to the incident; however, the letter from Mishima Zaibatsu head Heihachi Mishima in return contained a thinly veiled threat of consequences. She was incensed at the response, and immediately decided to enter the King of Iron Fist Tournament to stand up to Heihachi. \u2022 DLC19: New stage Island Paradise!

Getting both games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT\u2019s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem. Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world. You can be truly free. SUPERHOT Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets. SUPERHOT\u2019s features: Endless Mode : how long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies? Challenge Mode: take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more. Replay Editor: edit and upload your best runs for all to see on killterest.com. Extras: delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted]. Thirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and design. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and nominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by its independent, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the globe. SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT\u2019s signature power fantasy. You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow-motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they\u2019re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched. Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel. You take a moment to consider. You\u2019ve been here before. So many times. Maybe this time it will actually mean something. MCD\u2019s features The third game in the SUPERHOT franchise - MIND CONTROL DELETE gives you more insight into the world of SUPERHOT, more story, more signature gameplay. Keep dancing the slow motion ballet of destruction for so much longer than ever before. Much bigger than its predecessors. MCD immerses you in its world for days of increasingly explosive slow motion combat. More mechanics at your disposal than ever before. Experiment with different play styles, different character builds, different ways to outsmart and dominate your enemies. More power to accumulate as you progress through the game. Amass skills, hacks, special techniques to conquer waves of ever more dangerous enemies. More characters for you to control and for your enemies to throw at you.

This perfectly formed venue of 18 acres is steeped in history and feels like time has stood still with ancient stone walls and mature foliage whilst the superb water quality makes it perfect for big bream to grow on. The lough is visited by some of the best anglers in Europe who are all chasing the elusive records it holds including \u2018Banshee\u2019 that has been caught at an incredible 21lbs. Although all the attention is on the bream fishing, this lake also holds carp to just under 25lbs and good sized tench, roach and rudd. There are also three single player tournaments for you to master and three career mode events, as well as five new achievements that come with this venue.

Catch Arapaima that grow up to a huge 450lbs, red tail catfish go to 120lbs and black pacu up to 70lbs. Laguna Iquitos also has 25 new trophy fish and 3 new career events for you to master. With 1,500 acres of lake to fish from the water or shoreline you will need to utilise all of your skill, watercraft and equipment to discover everything this venue has to offer.

Combine loot in surprising ways and master each character until you become the havoc you feared upon your first crash landing. SURVIVE AN ALIEN PLANET Over a dozen handcrafted locales await, each packed with challenging monsters and enormous bosses that oppose your continued existence. Fight your way to the final boss and escape or continue your run indefinitely to see just how long you can survive. A unique scaling system means both you and your foes limitlessly increase in power over the course of a game. DISCOVER POWERFUL NEW ITEMS More than 110 items keep each run fresh and full of new challenge. The more items you collect, the more their effects combine, the more surprising some of those combinations might be. The more items you encounter, the more lore (and strategy) you\u2019ll discover through the logs. UNLOCK NEW WAYS TO PLAY Unlock a crew of ten playable survivors, each with their own unique combat style and alternate skills to master. Learn the secrets of the Artifacts to toggle gameplay modifiers like friendly fire, random survivor spawns, item selection and more. With randomized stages, enemies, and items, no run will ever be the same. PLAY SOLO OR CO-OP Tackle the adventure solo or with up to three friends in online co-op, or compete in the rotating challenge of the Prismatic Trials. Brand new survivors like the Captain and MUL-T join classic survivors such as the Engineer, Huntress, and--of course--the Commando.","SaleStarted":"2023-02-15","LowestPrice":"/game/65967","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/2220/RfRnyMuPPdQraj09cluhX5yZ.png?w=200","MainStory":10,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0292-CUSA16153_00-RISKOFRAIN2SIEA0","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYHY-VuyWdM","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":130,"genre":"Action, Action","PlusPrice":9.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/2220/RfRnyMuPPdQraj09cluhX5yZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Risk of Rain 2","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Gearbox Publishing","ReleaseDate":"2019-08-30","Slug":"risk-of-rain-2-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":24.99,"MainExtra":42,"SalePrice":17.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-03-02","description":"Exciting high-speed mech action game extends the original with new missions, new mechs, new graphics, and new action-packed WARFRONT mission mode. 1 player DUALSHOCK®4 Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).

Make your bullets count with the Peacemaker .45 Revolver where six bullets is enough to see six helmets fly. For those who need a few bullets more there is the Repeater 1874 Sniper Rifle. The Plainsrider Bow if you need no bullets at all. An arrow kills and doesn't make a sound. Unless you attach a pack of dynamite to it, which you can. The dynamite also comes as a throwable so you don't need to go through the potential hassle of having a bow. Ride off into the sunset with four new masks, and patterns.
