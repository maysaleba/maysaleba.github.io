And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you\u2019ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage...

Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive.

The line between the animal and the plant world has become blurred, and the food chain has been completely disrupted. Humans, upon making this incredible discovery, have set up outposts along the border of the aggressive plants\' habitat for investigations, defense, and in preparation for what may come. You take the role of a soldier on the front lines charged with confronting this strange new enemy. \\"Many years in the future, humanity looks upward in despair at plants, now standing atop the food chain. How could they have been so arrogant...\\" Only when plants began sprouting arms and legs and developing self-awareness did humanity truly begin to understand the menace that these once photosynthesis-dependent creatures posed. No one could understand how the plants took this large evolutionary leap in such a short time, something that took their animal counterparts millions of years to accomplish. One thing is certain, now is the time for humanity to make their stand in order to stay at the top of the food chain. As one of the first explorers of the newly discovered plant empire, you must continuously drive deeper and deeper into the enemy\'s lair. Defeat bizarre and colorful fruits while retrieving new gear, weapons, and resources to defend yourself and expand your base camp. If you\'re unable to defeat the overwhelming destructive force of the plant army alone, invite a few friends to lend a hand and help you\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_JuicyRealm_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/juicy-realm-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkYx_-6Ahms","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"30%","genre":"Action,Multiplayer","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"15.75","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_JuicyRealm.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"170.80","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/75263/juicy-realm-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Juicy Realm","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"X.D.

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community. Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \\"interludes\\", which were originally published separately, available now on Nintendo Switch\u2122 for the first time. Also for the first time, it has been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_KentuckyRouteZeroTvEdition_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0_n9QPves4","PeruPrice":"40","PercentOff":"40%","genre":"Adventure,Indie","ArgentinaPrice":"1199.99","AustraliaPrice":"19.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_KentuckyRouteZeroTvEdition.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"40000","SouthafricaPrice":"209.95","BrazilPrice":"59.99","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/55198/kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Annapurna Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2020-01-28","Slug":"kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"49.99","ChilePrice":"8000","Price":"24.99","MexicoPrice":"279.99","SalePrice":"14.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.51","SCORE":"55","SaleEnds":"2022-03-28","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-07","description":"With a brand new and exclusive Vertical \u201cTate\u201d Mode for Nintendo Switch\u2122, SkyScrappers is a 1-4 player arcade-style, competitive platform-fighting game.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player\'s score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"8.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"109","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"8.49","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-08","LowestPrice":"6.49","SaleStarted":"2022-03-19","description":"Shopping Mall Parking Lot offers an opportunity to drive multiple vehicles of all shapes and sizes around authentic looking, immersive environment!

Don\'t worry. No electrical know-how is required! You just need to skillfully operate a metal ball and build electric arcs with it where needed. It\'s quite simple and intuitive. Bear in mind that with each board comes with new challenges. Always start by planning your next move, then carefully execute it. Good luck!

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn\'t required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don\'t worry if you don\'t know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8Vlv9L9VM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"81","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/110363/rogue-bit-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"19","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"29.99","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"6.49","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-07","LowestPrice":"4.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-17","description":"Rodents! - Mouse - Scout - Capybara - Knight - Porcupine - Barbarian - Beaver - Wizard - Rat - Necromancer - Weasel - Swashbuckler - Every rodent has unique skills which get stronger as you use them - Every rodent hero has a unique back story - Every rodent hero has a unique list of challenges that limit their power Progression! - Power progression mechanic based on reincarnation - Every time a hero is defeated, subsequent heroes will be given power bonuses - By overcoming challenges all future heroes have an even greater potential to be more powerful Quests! - Seven quest zones - Forest - Desert - Jungle - Snow - Jungle - Mountain - Grassland - Parallax scrolling environments - Interactive dialogues with different Quests available depending on your progress - Take place inside of a maze - Mini map - Fog of war - Dynamic lighting with day / night cycle Enemies! - 50+ Enemies, including bosses - Each enemy has unique stats based on their classification - Tanky (Bonus health) - Vicious (Bonus damage) - Speedster (Bonus move speed) - Hyper (Bonus attack speed) - Hardened (Bonus defense) - Accurate (Bonus attack accuracy) - Have different abilities - Charge - Runs towards the Hero and does damage on impact - Ranged Attack - Fires projectiles - Ranged Bomber - Lobs projectiles that do damage on impact - Change Sides - Change from left side of Hero to right side or vice versa - Protector - Takes less damage and blocks projectiles\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RodentWarriors_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rodent-warriors-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Adventure,Action,Fighting,Role-Playing","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7.50","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RodentWarriors.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"90","BrazilPrice":"24.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Rodent Warriors","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"JanduSoft","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-18","Slug":"rodent-warriors-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"20","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"110","SalePrice":"4.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-04","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-14","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds.

Eighties of the twentieth century. The golden age of 8-bit video games. We were leaving school, and we were going to spend our precious coins in the arcade machines. One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari\'s Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time.

A young man is dazing off while working the night shift at a convenience store, when a girl stops in to ask for a meat bun. The one next to her appears to be her boyfriend, and after doing their shopping, the two of them link arms affectionately and take off. Just when the young man is thinking how nice it would be to have a girlfriend, a pair of girls in ninja cosplay show up. The girls just stare at the shop goods without buying anything in particular. Even worse, they\'re even chatting about ninja techniques or something along those lines. When he calls out to them to prevent theft, it becomes apparent that they have no money. Despite suspecting that they might try to steal something, he gives in and buys a bento for the two desperately pleading girls.

On a late-night highway drive, a quiet train car in the early hours, a walk through a moonlight park, or the endless wait in a deserted airport, we listen to weird music amid the ambient announcements of delays and question our place in the universe. Inspired by long travel and the stream of consciousness it fosters, Glitchhikers asks you to look inward. Find the answers to your questions and question the answers you receive. Ruminate on life, the universe, our place and purpose in it. Voyage through a freeform narrative experience, converse with the endless inevitability, and explore the cosmic, hopeful world you find yourself in.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5\'s hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\'s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON\'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\'ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\'ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You\'ll experience DEATHLOOP\'s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\'ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\'re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\'s stylish sneakers and invade another player\'s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON    <br />Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay.

You\'ll struggle, but you\'ll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts \'n Goblins.<br /><br />In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics.

The idea of the overwhelming power and immortality didn\'t leave his mind. The King realized that power over the living was not enough for him.<br /><br />The King decided to get the powerful artefact known as the Death Crown. Thus begins the War of the Death Crown.<br /><br />Key features:<br /><br />Clear strategic gameplay. Clear strategic gameplay. Everything is very simple: you only have barracks producing troops, mines producing gold, and towers protecting your buildings.

Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race.<br /><br />A new recovery mechanic<br />Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. <br />Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating. The lower the rating, the more the recovery profile penalises the race-day condition.<br /><br />Offline play enabled","ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-03","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/mDRlUb0UyukoAVgxgkjKZ1CF.png?w=200","Slug":"tour-de-france-2021-ps4-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6665-CUSA27350_00-TDF2100000000000","platform":"Playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"60%","Price":39.99,"genre":"Multiplayer,Sports","SalePrice":15.99,"PlusPrice":15.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-03-31 06:59:00","Title":"Trailmakers - Deluxe Edition","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-03-16 09:10:22","description":"Trailmakers Deluxe Edition includes:<br /> - Trailmakers - The full Game<br /> - Trailmakers Hat Pack <br /> - Trailmakers Skin Pack <br /> - Trailmakers Skin Pack 2<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console","ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Flashbulb Games","ReleaseDate":"2020-10-22","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0911/EOQutwo8qVZFQBoAwD4Axrnk.png?w=200","Slug":"trailmakers--deluxe-edition-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3731-CUSA18032_00-TRAILMAKERSDELUX","platform":"Playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"60%","Price":37.99,"genre":"Adventure,Simulation","SalePrice":15.19,"PlusPrice":15.19,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-03-31 06:59:00","Title":"Trails and Traces: The Tomb of Thomas Tew PS4 and PS5","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-03-16 07:10:24","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.<br /><br />In 1695, Tew and his fellow pirates pursued a Mughal ship.
