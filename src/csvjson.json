The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Renovate and decorate train stations and trains. Detailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements. Build your own station. Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TrainStationRenovation_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/train-station-renovation-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXqfY0pJ8lE","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"85%","genre":"Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"28.59","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TrainStationRenovation.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"342","BrazilPrice":"14.39","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/10317/train-station-renovation-switch","RussiaPrice":"1699","Title":"Train Station Renovation","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Forever Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-06","Slug":"train-station-renovation-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"69.99","ChilePrice":"","Price":"18.99","MexicoPrice":"58.49","SalePrice":"2.84"},{"CanadaPrice":"10.49","SCORE":"68","SaleEnds":"2022-01-24","LowestPrice":"8.99","SaleStarted":"2022-01-14","description":"Experience the thrilling adventures of the Parr family as they conquer crime and family life through both Disney-Pixar films The Incredibles and Incredibles 2, in a LEGO® world full of fun and humor.

Build a tower out of pots and trays. Everything with real-life physics. However, if you'd rather be a cook, the same physics engine gives you unlimited opportunities. Cut some vegetables, put them in a pot and boil. Use a blender to make a soup. Bake a fish fillet, but remember not to burn it! See your ingredients transform with temperature. The kitchen experience awaits!","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_CookingSimulator_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/cooking-simulator-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyp5uWXyGc","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"90%","genre":"Simulation,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"30","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_CookingSimulator.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"325","BrazilPrice":"11.36","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/7916/cooking-simulator-switch","RussiaPrice":"1499","Title":"Cooking Simulator","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Forever Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2020-05-14","Slug":"cooking-simulator-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"79.99","ChilePrice":"","Price":"19.99","MexicoPrice":"37.99","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.99","SCORE":"-1","SaleEnds":"2022-02-05","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-01-15","description":"Whether you are a Curling fan or you want to discover a new sport game, you'll enjoy playing Curling in its one player game or local multiplayer game .

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

Welcome to the Omni-Care sanctioned city. The world as we know it has come to an end and a New Order has taken over.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"8.99","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"109","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"539","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"4.79","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-01-25","LowestPrice":"3.99","SaleStarted":"2022-01-17","description":"Follow the Journey of the Little Firefly to seek The Mother deep inside the heart of the unknown forest!

History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.
