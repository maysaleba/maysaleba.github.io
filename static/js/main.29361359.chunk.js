Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of.<br /><br />Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him.

His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night.<br /><br />Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness.

So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown!<br /><br />Story<br /><br />A long time ago...<br /><br />In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.<br />The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.<br />...but suddenly something\'s amiss, the town is up in flames,<br />a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.<br /><br />The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.<br />Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.<br />And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.<br />While Arthur\'s back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.<br /><br />In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.<br />To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />Just like its predecessors, Ghosts \'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy!<br /><br />Ghosts \'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You\'ll die, and you\'ll die again, but you\'ll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You\'ll struggle, but you\'ll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts \'n Goblins.<br /><br />In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!<br /><br />In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur\'s inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!<br /><br />Make full use of Arthur\'s weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you\'re going to need it!<br /><br />On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys.

In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America\'s cities.<br /><br />These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.<br /><br />Offline play enabled","ESRBRating":"ESRB Mature","Publisher":"SOLD OUT SALES & MARKETING LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-28","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0311/EcTm14LTNjRgt0qM2gHT4502.png?w=200","Slug":"disjunction-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2660-CUSA23291_00-2248243448133775","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7tNpIu4wnc","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"50%","Price":15.99,"genre":"Role-Playing","SalePrice":7.99,"PlusPrice":7.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"58","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/27186/earthfall-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-07-07 06:59:00","Title":"Earthfall","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-06-22 08:12:19","description":"When the Earth falls to an extra-terrestrial invasion, humanity becomes an endangered species.

Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.<br /><br />The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.<br /><br />What\'s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\'ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.<br /><br />They don\'t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\'ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\'t happen but marketing text is hard to write.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Team Meat LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-19","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/1209/bhgDakvgeEnnYx3kinsfd3cw.png?w=200","Slug":"super-meat-boy-forever-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1055-CUSA16602_00-SUPERMEATBOYFORE","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKjjyDUgGd8","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"45%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Action,Platformer","SalePrice":10.99,"PlusPrice":10.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"73","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/113866/moving-out-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-07-07 06:59:00","Title":"Moving Out","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-06-22 08:11:29","description":"Moving Out is a ridiculous physics-based moving simulator that brings new meaning to \'couch co-op\'!<br /><br />Are you ready for an exciting career in furniture?

It\'s been months since you last saw Theo, and she\'s incredibly excited to spend the weekend together.<br /><br />She invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it\'s just the get-together that you need to reconnect.<br /><br />Everything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he\'s ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he\'s bringing along an uninvited guest.<br /><br />Although Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that\'s about the only thing you share in common...<br /><br />Will you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star?<br /><br />The Cast:<br /><br />Theo is your childhood friend. Although initially shy with strangers, Theo has a great sense of humour and loves to joke around with her friends. She prefers to have a tight-knit group and doesn\'t open up to just anyone. She studies photography at the same college as her roommate Lena and loves spending time with her. Theo won a draw for a cottage getaway in the town of Seaside and is your host for the weekend.<br /><br />Lena is Theo\'s roommate... and replacement best friend. You don\'t know much about her, or even what she\'s studying. From what you\'ve seen on Friendex, Lena is a vibrant and outgoing person. She\'s always dyeing her hair different colours and wearing cute clothes. According to her online bio, in her spare time she enjoys hiking and playing piano.<br /><br />Alec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both have similar hobbies like gaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally, renting a student house with Alec seemed like a great idea... until he started dating.

Fight for your life as you hurtle through the canopy of a futuristic metropolis. Step into the shoes of a master freerunner as you vault, swing, roll, and shoot your way through this intense, action-packed adventure. Will you survive the ultimate freerun?<br /><br />Experience the rush of parkour<br /><br />Navigate city rooftops like a parkour pro. Grab ledges, jump from roof to roof, vault through windows, slide down cables, swing from hooks: your possibilities are limited only by your attentiveness, creativity, and reactive skill.<br /><br />Designed for virtual reality, you\'ll feel the rush of leaping across impossibly wide gaps over dizzying heights. Don\'t look down!<br /><br />Fight for your life at 1,000ft<br /><br />Once you\'re a parkour pro, it\'s time to turn up the heat. Turn on enemies, and the city will be crawling with snipers who want you dead. To survive, you\'ll need to combine fast-paced parkour moves with strategic dodges as bullets fly your way.<br /><br />You\'re not defenseless - equip your own weapon and experience the satisfaction of picking off a sniper mid-air, nailing your landing on the edge of a skyscraper, then flowing straight into a wall-run to line up your next target!<br /><br />Of course, if the enemies are too much to handle, you can always disable them and focus on pure parkour.<br /><br />ARCADE MODES<br /><br />Endless mode<br /><br />Infinite level generation provides unlimited challenging terrain. Build your score by landing jumps over impossibly wide gaps, nailing insane wall-runs, sliding under barriers, and swinging between buildings. There\'s no turning back or time to stop - as the world quickly falls apart behind you. Oh, and did we mention the rooftops are crawling with snipers? Pull out your 9mm mid-air and pick them off as you glide across the gap between buildings.<br /><br />Time Run Mode<br /><br />Compete for the top spot on the leaderboard. In Time Run mode, it\'s all about speed. As the terrain unveils itself ahead of you, you\'ll need to visualize your route on the fly, and execute each move with precision.<br /><br />Arena Mode<br /><br />In Arena mode, you\'re presented with a spacious section of the city\'s rooftops, without the pressure of a creeping barrier coming up behind you. You have complete freedom of movement within this complex high-rise \u201carena\u201d but you\'ll be challenged with a variety of tasks. Examples include finding and collecting certain items , completing a specified route within a time limit, stealing an item without getting spotted by the snipers, or - simply - killing all the enemies!
