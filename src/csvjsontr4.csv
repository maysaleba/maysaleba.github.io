75,2023-11-01,"The canvas awaits its final brushstrokes. The stage calls for its lead actor. The novel needs its final chapter. It’s time to face your fears. One. Last. Time. The series that defined narrative-focused first-person psychological horror is back to tell its last spine-chilling story with Layers of Fear. The series’ crowning work is the definitive way to experience the critically acclaimed franchise as it features Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2, as well as all DLCs (including the new ‘The Final Note’ DLC that will give you a new perspective on the Layers of Fear storyline) and the never-before-told story of The Writer, which will tie everything together. Built on Unreal Engine 5, Layers of Fear supports Ray Tracing, HDR and 4K resolution to make the stunning visuals, and your nightmarish experience, as immersive and realistic as possible. Layers of Fear: Create Your Magnum Opus “The one precious thing you ever truly desired… FINISH IT.” Explore a Victorian mansion covered in artwork as The Painter, whose sanity crumbles and cracks just like old oil paint on canvas. Trawl through the ever-changing house to find the supplies needed for your greatest masterpiece, all while trying to outrun your past. Inheritance DLC: Face Your Past “I was once told insanity runs in my family… It’s time to make it stop.” Told from the perspective of The Painter’s Daughter, you come seeking answers. What secrets does this homestead hold? Will you ever truly understand the madness that bestowed your father? Can you ever forgive him? The house may hold everything you need to know... if you can face reliving your past. The Final Note DLC: Delve Even Deeper A brand new DLC which aims to shed more light on The Painter, his muse and the family’s backstory, The Final Note is told from the perspective of The Painter’s Wife. This additional narrative may change how you see the characters of the first game, as well as their actions. Layers of Fear 2: Hit Your Marks “Time waits for no one, actor. Do not waste ours.” You are the lead actor in a production being filmed aboard an ocean liner, but all is not what it seems. Explore the ship and discover why you were perfect for The Director’s (voiced by Tony Todd) latest film. You awake and are told one simple command “Act.” But will you? The Final Prologue The first expansion to Layers of Fear 2’s storyline allows you to step into the director’s seat and take the reins of a troubled Hollywood production. Immerse yourself into the psyche of the movie’s creator as you seek to complete your final masterpiece, even as the set around you descends into chaos. It’s up to you to direct the action and make sure that what’s in the script makes it onto the silver screen. Experiment with different takes and try to fulfill your vision of the ultimate horror movie, all while battling inner demons and external forces that threaten to derail the whole production. The Lighthouse Chapter: Link the Layers Enter a lone and ghastly lighthouse as the newest protagonist, The Writer, and discover a never-before-told tale which will tie the entire series together.

Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled—this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these—and more—to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience—a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported.

Based on the cult role-playing game and developed by specialists in the genre, Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong is a narrative RPG in which your every choice determines the fate of the three main characters and of the Boston Camarilla. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF DARKNESS What if vampires were real? What if these bloodthirsty predators lived hidden among us in complex societies and had been hatching conspiracies for thousands of years? And what if you became one of them? In Vampire: The Masquerade, you play as these alluring monsters in a sophisticated world where the lines between the real and supernatural are always blurred. A HEART-POUNDING THRILLER Hazel Iversen, the Swan, is the new Prince of the Boston Camarilla. An iron hand in a velvet glove, she intends to assert her power and respect the Masquerade, the vampiric law designed to ensure humans never learn of the existence of these creatures of the night. But nothing works as planned. With rumours of plots, murders and power struggles, you must work in the shadows to protect your Sect in a pulsating investigation that plunges Boston into chaos. PLAY AS 3 ORIGINAL VAMPIRES Play as 3 vampires who are over a hundred years old. Progress in the game through their intertwined destinies, deal with their different points of view and use their character sheets to try to separate the truth from the lies. Each character has their own vampiric abilities and disciplines that you can upgrade individually to suit your preferred approach. Will you choose intimidation, seduction or stealth? It's your decision, as long as you can sate your Hunger for blood. GAMEPLAY WITH CONSEQUENCES With its unique gameplay, Swansong puts emphasis on the consequences of your actions in both the investigation and your social interactions with other characters. Analyse each situation carefully because your decisions can have huge consequences on your heroes' lives and the fate of the Boston Camarilla.",2023-10-17,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA07302_00-VTMS000000000000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7L7M0R8fzA,70%,,Role-Playing,999999,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/vampire-the-masquerade---swansong/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5,Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong,TRD,NACON SA,2022-05-19,vampire-the-masquerade--swansong-ps5-tr,https://shope.ee/6KdHKvD1ZQ,1,1099,,329.7,0

,2023-11-01,"Paper Cut Mansion is a roguelite horror set in a papercraft world. Play as Toby, a police detective arriving at a mysterious old mansion. Explore the mansion floor by floor as you seek to unravel the story behind this bizarre place, with each run giving you the opportunity to collect another piece of evidence to be added onto your Evidence Board. The Mansion also hosts a mysterious cast of characters who may help or hinder your progress on each run... Features • Creepy and Thrilling storyline unfolds (pun intended) as you progress in the game and unlocks different endings depending on your performance • Game mechanics designed for high replayability • Perma-death • The more you fail and start over, the more you learn about the mechanics • Unique AI for each enemy type - unexpected behaviours - makes enemies creepier and more fearsome • Logical puzzles are designed to make the player think • Collectible Upgrades • Customize your equipment before each run to shape your own play style Run by run, Paper Cut Mansion will offer you the opportunity of defining your playstyle as you unlock new abilities and discover new equipment that will give you a better chance of overcoming the challenges each procedurally generated run throws at you. Each new item offers further customisation to your ultimate build, allowing for truly unique set ups. Do you want to get in close as a melee fighter or take shots from afar as a ranged marksman? Set yourself up with a drone who can do the fighting for you or create an engineering build who can lay down traps and turrets as you back enemies into them. Completing quests will also grant you temporary perks, making each run feel fresh as you may not get the same perks to choose from next time! The possibilities are endless and there is no correct way to overcome the ever-shifting procedural rooms of the mansion. The mansion itself also has a dimension-hopping twist. Each floor contains portals that lead you to alternate versions of the same location. Each dimension switches up the aesthetics and gameplay. You always start in the NeoCortex dimension, which plays out like an escape room, filled with challenges, puzzles and surprises. From there, you will receive quests that take you into the Reptilian Complex and the Limbic System Dimensions. In the Reptilian Complex, the mansion takes on a fiery appearance as it is overrun with monsters. The Limbic system sees an icy chill overtake the mansion. You’ll need to move quickly and stay near heat sources as the cold damages you on your search for hidden items or torches to light up. With a variety of enemies, clues, quests, secrets, loot and compelling logic puzzles scattered throughout the mansion, there is always something intriguing to discover on each run. There’s always something for you to keep track of - from kit upgrades, puzzles that need solving or quests to complete. Between each level a musical interlude will reveal more of the twisting story, with decisions you make throughout your run subtly affecting the final outcome - with 27 different possible endings wrapping up the tale. All this, combined with its incredible aesthetics, makes Paper Cut Mansion a roguelite you won’t want to miss.",2023-10-17,/game/112952,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/0809/Js4dKo2XYj1sdyw8t1hJhAcm.png?w=200,0,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5360-PPSA09516_00-PAPERCUTMANPS5EU,,60%,0,Horror,143.6,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/0809/Js4dKo2XYj1sdyw8t1hJhAcm.png,,Paper Cut Mansion,TRD,Thunderful Publishing AB,2022-12-05,paper-cut-mansion-ps4&ps5-tr,,1,359,0,143.6,1

You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE DEAD Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends.

However, the “original game soundtrack selections” are playable on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.

DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself.

The CURTAIN CALL Chapter is a Chapter for Dead by Daylight and it includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map. People often speak of the tears of a clown, of the sadness that lies beneath the greasepaint smile. What if that wasn’t sadness, but a deep malevolence, born of a life spent in the pursuit of drink and gluttony? A mind that sees others only as vessels for torture, and reduces their bodies down to a single finger, a trophy to be added to a collection? For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on. Kate Denson’s smile is genuine, friendly and warm. She sings of love and life, family and hope. She holds those values dear, and will fight anyone who tries to destroy them.

From residential homes, old English pubs, parks, stores, supermarkets and government buildings, all the way to the infamous HCPP research center.
