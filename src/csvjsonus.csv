88,2023-11-28,"DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane’s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.",2023-11-13,/game/68258,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200,16,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA01302_00-DEATHLOOP0000000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA,80%,34,Action,11.99,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/deathloop/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5,DEATHLOOP,USD,Bethesda Softworks,2021-09-14,deathloop-ps5-us,https://shope.ee/6ztaSECbKO,1,59.99,24,11.99,0

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before. France, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. EXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other. ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL Use ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target. HIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION Use workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal. INVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP Invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation. TENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER Customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode. ENHANCED KILL CAM More realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.",2023-11-13,/game/101756,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2116/59jHCjMBRhuRhPUKUUy2gkNd.png?w=200,10,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4363-PPSA01685_00-SNIPERELITE50000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVPeSJSkopk,60%,39,"Fighting, Action",0,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2116/59jHCjMBRhuRhPUKUUy2gkNd.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/sniper-elite-5/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5,Sniper Elite 5 PS4™ & PS5™,USD,Rebellion,2022-05-26,sniper-elite-5-ps4--ps5-ps4&ps5-us,https://shope.ee/Vg6hafecK,1,59.99,19,23.99,1

76,2023-11-28,"It’s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE DEAD Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there.

Play as Gaia, the Spirit of Life, and navigate stunning platforming environments in an abstract world to salvage the souls of extinct animals. Revive these creatures after learning their final fate: the last whale harpooned, the final eagle caged, the last deer hunted down, and more, while you survive encounters with dangerous, oil-covered Devourers that roam the wasteland in search of remaining life. In this emotional journey from the creators of the critically acclaimed Arise: A Simple Story, you alone can restore life to the planet. Key Features: • Gaia’s journey: the last animals have died, and Mother has used all of her Life Force to save their souls, now trapped in their vessels. Gaia’s quest is to rescue each of their souls and bring them back to Mother’s Ark. Gaia’s traversal abilities will allow you to glide, jump, and dash to explore new areas and evade deadly traps, while her special gifts will grant you the power to clear the oil that consumes the world, face hungry Devourers, and break souls free. • A vast, surrealistic world: see through Gaia’s eyes the desolated landscapes that depict the destructive relationships between humans and nature in a beautiful demonstration of abstract artistry. From dying forests to the heart of crumbling cities, through the dry seabed and polluted skies, each environment will offer new challenges for Gaia to face and will present her different versions of the Devourers’ wake of destruction as she spreads life and beauty on her path. • A story of contrasts: After Us offers a somber look at a world decimated by human impact. As you guide Gaia’s light through it and discover the causes behind the destruction, you will learn the fate of the Devourers as agents of extinction, but also agents of progress, love, and hope.",2023-11-13,/game/118233,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202304/0312/293739904a7a7ce07856d5e3324f6e3dcd1e3602fb442425.png?w=200,5,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4581-PPSA07948_00-AFUS00000000SIEA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4ly0NRLaLU,50%,11,Adventure,14.99,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202304/0312/293739904a7a7ce07856d5e3324f6e3dcd1e3602fb442425.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/after-us/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5,After Us,USD,Private Division,2023-05-23,after-us-ps5-us,https://shope.ee/8A5Xo7KZsI,1,29.99,8,14.99,0

Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement. The Tightest Crew The legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. Ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, one born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake.

In addition to gold, cash and jewelry and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics and accolades.

Gain experience, unlock new skills and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges.

In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays. Thrive in Co-op Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends in mind, whether you bring them from your childhood or make them along the road.

The katamari that he created floated in space, sparkling, and brought back the lost starry sky. As the starry sky was restored, the King's fans gradually grew in number all over the world. The King wanted to respond to the wishes of his fans for his success, and the Prince kept rolling the katamari to make everyone's dreams come true. •We Love Katamari Damacy has been powered up! We Love Katamari Damacy, the second title in the Katamari series released in 2005, has been remastered. The graphics have been completely redesigned, and the in-game UI has been revamped to make it even easier to play. •New additional features such as Royal Reverie are also available! In his youth, the King received a strict education from his father, the Great King. New challenges have been added where you can roll around as the King in his boyhood! The days of hard study and intense training can all be rolled through in 5 all-new challenges. Will the young King be able to clear the tough challenges? In addition, a selfie mode has been added, allowing the Prince and his cousins to take quick photos while rolling through the stages! •A simple but very deep game! Roll the katamari, roll up objects, and make the katamari bigger.

,2023-11-28,"Whether you are a long-time fan of the world created by J. R. R. Tolkien or whether you are exploring The Lord of the Rings for the first time, the Precious Edition offers an even more immersive game experience. This edition includes: - The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ base game. - The Sindarin VO DLC, which adds a touch of authenticity to dialogue with the Elves. - The Lore Compendium DLC, a treasure trove of information about the game's key characters, locations and events, taking you deep into the history of Middle-earth. - The Original Soundtrack application so you can listen to the game soundtrack whenever you want. - The Art Exhibition application that takes you behind the scenes of the game creation process with lots of sketches and development secrets. The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ is an official adaptation based on the literary works of J.R.R Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose… How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring ™, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself… or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble.

Step into your own fully immersive throne room with Crusader Kings: Royal Court, and get ready to impress vassals and courtiers with your splendor and treasure on display. Watch visitors pay respect or family members squabble as you pass judgment in royal audiences, establishing the vital link between your people and your realm. In Crusader Kings: Royal Court, you can commission great works of art from inspired craftspeople. Impress your rivals with the grandeur of your court, or awe them with your noble house’s heirlooms and relics. An enhanced Culture system lets you guide your people to novel cultural understandings as they merge or splinter off, embrace their heritage, learn languages, or acquire new traditions.

Hold court and watch as your courtiers scheme and vie for your attention. ? Match yourself against your greatest rival with your court’s grandeur. Or fail to impress them and suffer the sad diplomatic consequences of bad taste. A true treasure ? Show off your exquisitely crafted relics, or focus on your noble house’s history with your family heirlooms. A whole range of new artifacts can be admired in the series’ return of the inventory system. ? Talented craftspeople, from jewelers to weavers, can be employed on special projects, adding even more unique items to your domain. ? Commission special great works of art or win artifacts in battle.

As they experience life together there will be opportunities for both drama and unity that will affect family dynamics and Sims’ relationships with their family members.

Whenever you need quality equipment to fight zombies in the streets of Harran, you can be sure they’ll have your back. But their story began long before the infection has taken over the world. In the early 20th century, as Volkan Machines, they didn’t have much time to lounge about either, producing a variety of arms for the best of soldiers.

Pilot 3 fighters and take back the sun from the clutches of evil in this free-form shooting game with the spirit of 80s shooting classics Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta. PlatinumGames’ NEO-CLASSIC ARCADE series carries on the spirit and fun of classic gaming using modern technology, and the first project in this endeavor is SOL CRESTA. SOL CRESTA takes the docking and formation strategies of classic shooting games Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta and elevates them with the “free-form docking” system. The flagship Yamato, composed of the fighters Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susano can utilize various attacks depending on how the three ships are aligned. Docking, splitting, and reforming the ships as needed is the key to defeating the invading armies of Mega Zofer. Story Humanity faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Mandler Army during their last invasion of the solar system. Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune. With the last of their hope, they formed the solar recovery squad SOL CRESTA, and placed the fate of the solar system with the Yamato, a cutting-edge docking ship. -Free-Form Docking The Yamato, standing against the evil of Mega Zofer, is composed of 3 fighters. You’ll scramble with only one fighter at first, but pick up the right item and friendly fighters will appear for a power-up! Dock and split to change your attack properties and use different formations to access an amazing arsenal. -Classic 80s-Style Excitement SOL CRESTA’s music is provided by legendary chiptune composer Yuzo Koshiro, and the game pays homage to the sound and visuals of the earlier Cresta series games, bringing back that arcade fever while taking it beyond mere nostalgia. There’s even a time limit, high score Caravan Mode, and online leaderboards. -PlatinumGames' New Challenge What would happen if PlatinumGames, developers of satisfying and jam-packed action games like Bayonetta, NieR:Automata, and ASTRAL CHAIN tried their hand at shooting? This is the answer. The visuals are classic, but the originality and depth of the systems and gameplay provide a fresh and deep shooting experience that grows each time you play.",2023-11-13,/game/104489,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202201/2607/dnlQ8xBV74eHY6V60C3J35ZF.png?w=200,1,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2522-CUSA26894_00-PGNCA01SOLCRESTA,,55%,0,Shooter,17.99,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202201/2607/dnlQ8xBV74eHY6V60C3J35ZF.png,,SOL CRESTA,USD,PLATINUMGAMES INC.,2022-02-22,sol-cresta-ps4-us,,0,39.99,4,17.99,1

Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune.

The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies.

Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor.

Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons?

Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger.

Both DLCs expand on the base game’s locations, characters, combat, and systems, further expanding on the Rangers’ mission while in Colorado. The Expansion Pass contains: DLC 1 - The Battle of Steeltown – Now available! The towering factory complex of Steeltown manufactures all the tech that keeps Colorado running and the Patriarch in power—trucks, armor, weapons, and robots. But deliveries from Steeltown have stopped cold, and all the Patriarch is getting from Abigail Markham—Steeltown's leader—are excuses. When he sends the Rangers to investigate, they find the place is a powder keg with the fuse already lit. The workers are striking, bandits raid with impunity, and nobody is allowed through the gates, not even on the business of the Patriarch. Without help, Steeltown could crash and burn for good, and take Markham with it—but maybe that's just what it needs. The Rangers will have to decide that for themselves. DLC 2 – Cult of the Holy Detonation – Now available! Cult of the Holy Detonation expands the Wasteland 3 experience with entry into the Cheyenne Mountain complex, crammed with new characters, enemies, challenging combat encounters, and powerful new weapons and armor.

Well then, CONGRATULATIONS! I hereby officially pronounce you Commander of this Space Station! Hopefully you will enjoy more success than your predecessor who, according to the logbook, er… ran into some wormlike Aliens… Oh, nothing to worry about! To keep the same thing from happening to you, there's a lot you're going to have to do. Amongst others, there’s the development of further Sectors, maintenance of the three vital Main Decks as well as the customer acquisition and entertainment of our extraterrestrial visitors, who provide us with sufficient Energy for our plans for global improvement.

In addition to the challenging single player Campaign and the versatile battle mode, there are also competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes for up to four players. And as if maintaining the three Space Station Decks, entertaining the eight Alien races and defending against enemy invaders were not enough of a challenge, the dynamic narrator AI is not going to mince matters and commentates the events in a lovely but sharp-tongued manner. - The 10-mission, fully dubbed single-player Campaign will require all your skills as Commander of the Spacebase Startopia as you strive to create one of the most attractive trade and tourism destinations in the known universe. - Each of the three Decks will require your leadership skills, with the Sub Deck containing all of the Rooms vital to survival, while the Fun Deck focuses on your visitors and the flora and fauna found on the Bio Deck provides sufficient Resources for survival as well as a home to the graceful Dryads. - Prevail against your competitors, for you are not alone on the Space Station. Sabotage your opponents' economy or attack them with your Mech Units, conduct trade and beware of Space Pirates eager to board your Station. - The dynamic narrator AI “VAL” reacts to your decisions and is always at your side in both word and deed – and the occasional extremely unqualified comment. - In addition to the extensive single player Campaign, an individually configurable sandbox mode as well as both a competitive and a cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players awaits you.

Along with an outfit you’ll receive a new buggy paint job (Veteran’s Ride) and blueprints for three new weapons. Whatever horrors Harran throws at you, you’ll be ready with your trusty Hellbeast. This fully homemade (no firearm needed to craft it!) double-barreled shotgun packs a hellish punch and its extreme fire rate makes it an ideal crowd control tool. Your First is a return to the roots, but unlike the random gas pipe you clenched at the beginning, this one grants you a damage boost after three consecutive hits. And if you need to hit even harder, you can’t go wrong with a sledgehammer (Feather).

Music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to the Tetriminos themselves—pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you're playing, making any of the game's 30+ stages and 10+ modes something you'll want to experience over and over again. Plus cross-platform multiplayer modes for competitive and cooperative play! • An exhilarating single-player experience full of surprises. Over 30 different stages, each with its own music, sound effects, graphical style and background that all evolve and change as you play through them. • The Zone is an all-new mechanic designed just for Tetris Effect: Connected! Includes the all-new “Zone” mechanic, where players can stop time (and Tetriminos falling) by entering “the Zone” and either get out of a sticky situation that could otherwise lead to “Game Over,” or rack up extra Line Clears for bonus rewards. • Cross-platform multiplayer lets you play with players from all over the world! Players on different platforms can easily join Friend Match rooms with the new Room ID feature. • A wide variety of competitive and co-op modes! Among the new modes is CONNECTED, where three players can team up and literally connect their Tetris Matrices to fight against A.I.-controlled Bosses; Zone Battle, a one-on-one match of standard competitive Tetris, but with a twist: the time-stopping Zone mechanic; and Score Attack and Classic Score Attack,” two single-player versus modes where two players compete separately to see who can get the best score. • Join in on the fun in Spectator mode! Spectator mode is available in Friend Matches. A room can contain up to 8 total people. Spectators can use emotes during the match to liven up the competition.
