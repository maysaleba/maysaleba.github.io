Will you reach the center? And if so, what will you discover about yourself there, in the dark? There is but one enemy... But it is the unbeatable Minotaur. Only by exploring the maze of the Labyrinth can you hope to discover how to defeat this immortal monster. The great maze has many tools, many rewards, and many secrets just waiting for you to find them. But you can\u2019t waste your precious time, for the Minotaur is getting ever closer. Dark Flavour The game is inspired by the Greek myth of the labyrinth and the fight between Theseus and the Minotaur. The dark theme is visually expressed by retro pixel art, enriched by voice acting and metaphorical storytelling, creating (we hope) a thrilling atmosphere. The Labyrinth The journey has 6 chapters - each with its own specific challenges, patterns, and rewards. A total of 42 stages, 5 skill upgrades - each with 3 levels, 3 hidden upgrades, 2 unique upgrades, secret passages and Easter eggs.

Bringing back old school difficulty, Spinch will have you replaying sections until you master your timing and reflexes. Dash, dodge, climb, swim, jump, and even shoot your own babies as you take on six enigmatic bosses in six vibrant worlds.

His works contain an affiliation with psychedelia, spirituality, alternate realities, and a blending of nature with technology. James Kirkpatrick, well known for his participation in the early Canadian graffiti movement and as avant-garde hip-hop artist, Thesis Sahib, created the audio landscape of retro soundbites and electronic sounds found within Spinch.

Fight countless enemies with a huge selection of gun turrets (in the form of comic heroes) and additional helpers (mines, air support, block wall) on more than 60 maps. Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

Some shoot rockets, some try to intoxicate you, some place nasty mines on the ground...and then there are the final bosses as well, but we'd rather not spoil you that. Accuracy and speed are necessary to be victorious over these damned creatures. But you may be overwhelmed, and that\u2019s why you should also look for new armor suits and upgrade them. Last but not least, your loyal dog will show you the direction to new ammo and HP boxes ready to pick-up.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however.

Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality.

Best way to describe this game by phrase: Â«fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzlesÂ». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way.

Through your actions, you will be able to see how difficult it is to manage during a crisis, what impact various decisions can have on an effective fight against a global epidemic, which can be caused by listening to charlatans or the lack of appropriate medical equipment.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDs_VirusTheOutbreak_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/virus-the-outbreak-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":"","genre":"Simulation,Strategy","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"5.25","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDs_VirusTheOutbreak.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"63","BrazilPrice":"7.19","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"VIRUS: The Outbreak","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Forever Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2020-12-28","Slug":"virus-the-outbreak-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"13.99","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"37.99","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"29.39","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-18","LowestPrice":"27.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-01","description":".","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/v/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-plus-valkyria-chronicles-4-bundle-switch/hero","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/valkyria-chronicles-plus-valkyria-chronicles-4-bundle-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing,Strategy","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"","MexPrice":"","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Valkyria Chronicles + Valkyria Chronicles 4 Bundle","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"SEGA","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-29","Slug":"valkyria-chronicles-plus-valkyria-chronicles-4-bundle-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"","ChilePrice":"","Price":"39.99","MexicoPrice":"342.30","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"27.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.49","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-06","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-15","description":"Find the original fighting experience with this hardcore beat'em up game.

Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay You need to conquer a big portion of the initial area that you start the level. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield empties. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and required conquered area percentage for the victory. What happens when you pass a level? You see the related girl's photo and can continue with her story or unlock the next girl. How many girls and bosses? 8 girls, 24 bosses, 24 minions, 24 levels, 8 mega levels, 4 traps, 4 power-ups, and 2 towers! Evil towers of course. Each boss and his minions were uniquely designed.

Welcome to the Omni-Care sanctioned city. The world as we know it has come to an end and a New Order has taken over. Life is seemingly perfect, in an almost utopian society humans have to officially schedule their whole days in advance via \"ports\" - mandatory cybernetic implants. Large commercial entities who also happen to be port manufacturers have replaced governments and crime is practically non existent. You are the hero of this exciting cyberpunk tale, about to start a regular day, only for it to unfold in the most unexpected manner revealing the true nature of the multi-layered city. FEATURES A unique story and lore: Remember that you are thrown into a world of specific rules, laws, customs, lingo, social segregation etc which you will learn and unravel in time along the way. Old school gameplay. Therefore many features or lore related backstories/explanations are not thrown in your face. Instead they are somewhere in the world.
