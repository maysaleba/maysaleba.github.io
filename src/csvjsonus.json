There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet?<br /><br />Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies?<br /><br />Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars.<br /><br />Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors.<br /><br />Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment.<br /><br />These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue?<br /><br />Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We've collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.","ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone","Publisher":"THE IRREGULAR CORPORATION","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-17","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png?w=200","Slug":"mars-horizon-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5097-CUSA18503_00-0000000000000000","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gqbz8C8bX0","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"40%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Simulation,Strategy","SalePrice":11.99,"PlusPrice":11.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"79","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/102057/age-of-wonders-planetfall-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-05-26 06:59:00","Title":"Age of Wonders: Planetfall","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-11 07:10:39","description":"Emerge from the cosmic dark age of a fallen galactic empire to build a new future for your people.

Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny.<br /><br />In Evertried, the player's actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success.<br /><br />You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension!<br /><br />Test Your Strategic Might<br />Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy.<br /><br />Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills<br />Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don't forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level.<br /><br />Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny<br />The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top.<br /><br />Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses<br />Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.","ESRBRating":"ESRB Everyone 10+","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-21","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png?w=200","Slug":"evertried-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4127-CUSA28069_00-EVERTRIEDPS4US00","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImOYOo4RR4","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"40%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Strategy","SalePrice":11.99,"PlusPrice":11.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-26 06:59:00","Title":"Expand + Soundtrack Bundle","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-11 08:11:27","description":"Expand is a 2D indie game in which you guide a pink square through a circular labyrinth that constantly rotates, unfolds and expands around you.
