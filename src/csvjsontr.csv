"88","2024-11-01","DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane’s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","2024-10-17","/game/68258","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","16","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","80%","35","Action","499.8","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/deathloop","DEATHLOOP","TRD","Bethesda","2021-09-13","deathloop-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2499.00","24","499.80","0","4",

His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder.

"80","2024-11-01","Ghostrunner is a hardcore FPP game packed with lightning-fast action, set in a grim, cyberpunk megastructure. Climb Dharma Tower, humanity’s last shelter, after a world-ending cataclysm. Make your way up from the bottom to the top, confront the tyrannical Keymaster, and take your revenge. The streets of this tower city are full of violence. Mara the Keymaster rules with an iron fist and little regard for human life. As resources diminish, the strong prey on the weak and chaos threatens to consume what little order remains. The decisive last stand is coming. A final attempt to set things right before mankind goes over the edge of extinction. As the most advanced blade fighter ever created, you’re always outnumbered but never outclassed.

The series that defined narrative-focused first-person psychological horror is back to tell its last spine-chilling story with Layers of Fear. The series’ crowning work is the definitive way to experience the critically acclaimed franchise as it features Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2, as well as all DLCs (including the new ‘The Final Note’ DLC that will give you a new perspective on the Layers of Fear storyline) and the never-before-told story of The Writer, which will tie everything together. Built on Unreal Engine 5, Layers of Fear supports Ray Tracing, HDR and 4K resolution to make the stunning visuals, and your nightmarish experience, as immersive and realistic as possible. Layers of Fear: Create Your Magnum Opus “The one precious thing you ever truly desired… FINISH IT.” Explore a Victorian mansion covered in artwork as The Painter, whose sanity crumbles and cracks just like old oil paint on canvas. Trawl through the ever-changing house to find the supplies needed for your greatest masterpiece, all while trying to outrun your past. Inheritance DLC: Face Your Past “I was once told insanity runs in my family… It’s time to make it stop.” Told from the perspective of The Painter’s Daughter, you come seeking answers. What secrets does this homestead hold? Will you ever truly understand the madness that bestowed your father? Can you ever forgive him? The house may hold everything you need to know... if you can face reliving your past. The Final Note DLC: Delve Even Deeper A brand new DLC which aims to shed more light on The Painter, his muse and the family’s backstory, The Final Note is told from the perspective of The Painter’s Wife. This additional narrative may change how you see the characters of the first game, as well as their actions. Layers of Fear 2: Hit Your Marks “Time waits for no one, actor. Do not waste ours.” You are the lead actor in a production being filmed aboard an ocean liner, but all is not what it seems. Explore the ship and discover why you were perfect for The Director’s (voiced by Tony Todd) latest film. You awake and are told one simple command “Act.” But will you? The Final Prologue The first expansion to Layers of Fear 2’s storyline allows you to step into the director’s seat and take the reins of a troubled Hollywood production. Immerse yourself into the psyche of the movie’s creator as you seek to complete your final masterpiece, even as the set around you descends into chaos. It’s up to you to direct the action and make sure that what’s in the script makes it onto the silver screen. Experiment with different takes and try to fulfill your vision of the ultimate horror movie, all while battling inner demons and external forces that threaten to derail the whole production. The Lighthouse Chapter: Link the Layers Enter a lone and ghastly lighthouse as the newest protagonist, The Writer, and discover a never-before-told tale which will tie the entire series together.

As a medium you see, hear and experience more than others, and with every new perspective you will change your perception on what happened at the Niwa resort. PLAY IN TWO WORLDS AT THE SAME TIME Never-seen-before gameplay that plays out across two worlds displayed at the same time. Explore the physical world and the spirit world simultaneously, and use the interactions between them to solve dual-reality puzzles, unlock new paths, and awaken memories of past events. ENTER A DARK REALITY INSPIRED BY BEKSIŃSKI The Medium’s spirit world is a dark mirror reflection of our reality, a grim and unsettling place where our unpunished deeds, evil urges, and vile secrets manifest themselves and can take on a form. This world has been invented and designed under the inspiration of Zdzisław Beksiński’s paintings, Polish dystopian surrealist internationally recognized for his distinctive and strikingly ominous style. MUSIC BY YAMAOKA & REIKOWSKI Immerse yourself in the disturbing and oppressive atmosphere of the game thanks to the original ‘dual’ soundtrack co-created by Akira Yamaoka and Arkadiusz Reikowski. Yamaoka-san is a legendary Japanese composer best known for his work on the Silent Hill series; Reikowski is a Hollywood Music in Media Awards nominee who worked on such acclaimed horror games as Blair Witch, Layers of Fear, and Observer. Now they join their creative forces for the music and songs of The Medium.","2024-10-22","/game/78037","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1813/DV0IXPHtc7JRTLoxsKAg0sJh.png?w=200","8","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4176-PPSA03718_00-5144890209675501","60%","9","Horror","699.6","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-medium","The Medium","TRD","BLOOBER TEAM S.A.","2021-09-02","the-medium-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","8","699.60","0","",

If enemies penetrate your perimeter you need to zoom into close range combat and beat them back, adjusting to a completely different perspective in the blink of an eye. Welcome to Jeff Minter’s Akka Arrh. This modern take from the fine developers at Llamasoft combines the intrigue of an incredibly rare Atari arcade prototype with a unique creative vision that delivers a wave shooter that is insanely addictive. Akka Arrh drips with Minter’s sense of humor, love of psychedelic color, and ability to create games that are a joy to play. Key Features: Pure arcade bliss! You'll be thrown directly into the action where combos, high scores, and survival are your only goals. Create massive chains of enemy explosions and rack up ammo for precision shots to keep a combo and your rings (or life force) protected. Lose them all, and it’s game over. Start from the beginning of the 50 unique levels, or pick up where you left off to power through to the end. Accessibility! Sensitive to flashing lights or just not a fan? Not to worry, as there is an option to disable the more intense visual effects so that the experience can be enjoyed by a wider audience.","2024-10-22","/game/118249","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/2216/RR6HkCCpeYX65wLfl1vGsP6V.png?w=200","1","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0182-PPSA10084_00-3651066137094003","55%","0","Shooter, Arcade","157.05","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/akka-arrh","Akka Arrh","TRD","ATARI EUROPE S.A.S.U.","2024-03-07","akka-arrh-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","349.00","0","157.05","1","",

"72","2024-11-06","""El Hijo - A Wild West Tale"" is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a young boy on his quest to find his mother. As a six-year-old, “El Hijo” must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn’t feel right and he plans his escape. “El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Using the shadows to his advantage is the core element of the game, as “El Hijo” will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that “El Hijo” must traverse to reach his ultimate goal. - Survive the Wild West through the cleverness of a young hero - Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world - Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless - Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles - Use an arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes - Inspire other children to join you on the path to freedom - Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/WYjKQ407XRGoyRypUoBZTrPI.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4539-CUSA17029_00-BASEGAME00000000","70%","0","Unique","174.75","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/el-hijo-a-wild-west-tale","El Hijo - A Wild West Tale","TRD","www.handy-games.com GmbH","2021-03-25","el-hijo-a-wild-west-tale-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","209.70","1","",

You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory? The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat. Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world. - Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries. - Permadeath. All characters that die in combat will stay dead – unless they return as the undead. - All characters come with their own background stories and traits. Want a stuttering ratcatcher, a greedy witch hunter or a drunkard disowned noble? - Character development without a restrictive class-system. Each Character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks. - Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills – split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer. - Diverse enemy roster. All enemies have unique equipment, skills and AI behavior. - A dynamic event system with atmospheric encounters and tough decisions outside of combat. - Three late game crises – a war between noble houses, a Greenskin invasion and an undead scourge – add a looming threat. - Two full hours of orchestral soundtrack.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/0114/duK8hFPWukslgpBlrUFQV6Me.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3736-CUSA28064_00-BATTLEBROTHERSEU","50%","0","Action, Strategy","499.5","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/battle-brothers","Battle Brothers","TRD","UKIYO PUBLISHING LIMITED","2022-01-13","battle-brothers-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","999.00","0","499.50","1","",

"69","2024-11-01","From the top of Megacity S1-9, the Sovereign Khan rules with fists of iron and flesh. Beneath the city’s rotting foundations, a vengeful warrior embarks on a journey to murder him. 5 years prior to the events of Slave Zero, Slave Zero X brings new life to a world where horrific, living machines known as Slaves are primed to become the latest tools of war in humanity’s long and bloody history. A secret band of warriors known as The Guardians hope to stop these biomecha from being unleashed upon the world, but one swordsman among their ranks has a different idea: use the enemy’s own weapon against them.

"69","2024-11-01","Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes. Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled—this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these—and more—to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience—a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","2024-10-17","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0102-CUSA24163_00-MAKAIRE000000001","67%","0","Action","346.17","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection","Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection","TRD","CE EUROPE LIMITED","2021-05-31","ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","346.17","1","",

Combining a mix of classic text-adventure, point-and-click and more, 4 short stories are packaged together into a single mysterious anthology that has been described as “a fantastic, fascinating example of interactive visual storytelling” (Telegraph 5/5) and earning widespread critical acclaim since release. The game pulls together 80s retro nostalgia, innovative and experimental genre-defying gameplay, and tense, phycological horror to create “one of the most fascinating and unique tales you can play this year” (GameSpew 9/10). “Stories Untold” was developed by No Code, a Glasgow based ex-AAA development team headed up by Jon McKellan (Alien: Isolation) and Omar Khan. Features: - Four unique stories, with their own settings, gameplay and mechanics. - Play mind-bending text adventures, process radio transmissions and conduct experiments on bizarre artifacts. - Gorgeous retro-aesthetic brings back vivid memories, or a glimpse into what was. - Sublime synth-wave horror soundtrack, inspired by 80s horror soundtracks. - Genre-hopping: from psychological horror, to tense mystery and terrifying sci-fi; Stories Untold is truly “4 stories, 1 nightmare”.","2024-10-17","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202010/2815/BN3c5PyWJJxA3oZXlzAojSb2.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3643-CUSA17338_00-STORIESUNTOLDEU0","85%","0","Horror, Adventure, Adventure","34.9","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/stories-untold","Stories Untold","TRD","Devolver Digital","2020-10-27","stories-untold-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","52.35","1","",

They will help you defend your camp while you explore the world looking for… a new paradise. Welcome to ParadiZe! Do you want your very own zombie companion? A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen! Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable. It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive… A destination with plenty of surprises Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive. Home sweet home Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. The more the merrier… You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable. Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.

In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming 8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he takes on hordes of zombies let loose upon the world.

"60","2024-11-01","Hell Pie is an obscene 3D platformer that takes bad taste to the next level! The game sees you grab the horns of Nate, the ‘Demon of Bad Taste’. He is given the honorable task of gathering the disgusting ingredients for Satan’s infamous birthday pie. To do so, Nate must venture out into the overworld and do whatever it takes to ensure those ingredients are secured in time, or there’ll be hell to pay! Luckily Nate isn’t alone on this quest, his ‘pet’ angel Nugget is there to offer support.

Nate can also equip horns he finds across the world to give him new hellish abilities. Together Nate and Nugget will explore insane environments, meet tons of repugnant characters and witness some truly shocking sights. Hell Pie is a seriously twisted take on the classic mascot platformer, come along for the ride if you think you can stomach it! FEATURES: Become a demon: You're Nate, demon of bad taste, the 8th deadly sin. While not taken very seriously in hell, he is feared on earth (by some...a few...2-3 people at least).

Freedom: Use the extensive moveset to overcome obstacles the way you want. Stuff: Collect things! Lots of things! Hell and above: Explore 4 big worlds and survive challenging platforming levels. Fashion: Buy outfits. You're the demon of bad taste and should look the part.

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. The game centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a shockingly enjoyable sci-fi action running game where the player uses techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action bundle and with it re-invents the running game genre.

The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality, inspired by the bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Konigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation. Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy’s weak points against them.","2024-10-17","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/2214/ULouZNFHNgrQorotB3Zre4sC.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA10961_00-000THEINQUISITOR","20%","0","Adventure","599.2","null","null","The Inquisitor","TRD","Kalypso Media GMBH","2024-02-08","the-inquisitor-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","749.00","0","599.20","0","",

"","2024-11-01","The Absolute Evil and its trusted *cough* servant, the Dark Elf Thalya, return in Dungeons 4 after the events of its fabulous predecessor to bring about their triumph over the forces of good once more. Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise. But what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart. Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic EvilnessÃ¢„Â¢. Features: • Everything is better with DwarvesÃ¢„Â¢: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources. • It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! • Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. • New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. • Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. • Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. • Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. • Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together. All maps from the skirmish mode and the campaign are playable in co-op.","2024-10-17","/game/134131","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0312/cc9b9859c73692c8ddbb19f5d922c0598070db16cb0b86de.png?w=200","25","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA07937_00-DUNGEONS40000000","20%","34","Strategy","1399.2","null","null","Dungeons 4","TRD","Kalypso Media GMBH","2023-11-08","dungeons-4-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","34","1399.20","0","",

Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That’s what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience unmatched. Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement. The Tightest Crew The legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. They've been ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake. In order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan. Give In to Your Greed Give your greed an outlet and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash, jewelry, and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics, and accolades.

Gain experience, unlock new skills, and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges. The Art of the Heist A professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work, and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist.

Do you go it alone or bring friends? The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays out. Thrive in Co-op Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends, whether you bring them along from your childhood or make them along the road.

Be careful, though, because in the darkness of the desolate, labyrinthine depths of the military research center there is something creepy and lethal awaiting you! Grab one of the most innovative and technologically advanced weapons of all time and prepare to face never-before-seen creatures while you make your way through a series of frightfully evocative settings all ready to be discovered. A perfect mix of fierce and deadly enemies, hardcore action game mechanics, environmental puzzles, a chilling soundtrack, plenty of exploration and massive doses of concentrated horror wait for you in Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle. No place is safe, especially when you’re being hunted by your nightmares. Game features: - New characters and big comebacks – take part in the top secret ""Sandcastle"" mission as the game's main protagonist, Special Agent H.A.D.E.S. Dalila Reyes, and reconstruct the past of some of Daymare: 1998's most beloved characters. - Lethal and terrifying enemies – fight, kill and dismember the new enemies that stand between you and the resolution of your mission, so frighteningly intelligent, aggressive and realistic in every detail. - Revamped interface – the D.I.D. is back, though in a completely redesigned way. Manage your inventory, ammo and health items directly from the new game interface, which has never been so simple and intuitive. - Eye to the Scanner – thanks to the innovative device installed on Reyes’s arm, you can analyze portions of the environment and reveal new puzzles to solve, pick up secret documents and detect hidden items! - Environmental puzzles – the solution is often right in front of your eyes! Search for all the clues and overcome the environmental obstacles to obtain resources and collectibles. - Are you sure it’s dead? – in Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle, prepare to confront the toughest and most aggressive enemies you have ever seen. Moreover, even if you’re sure you’ve killed one, you’ll find out it can come back in a completely new form and even deadlier than before! - Breathtaking and immersive graphics, sound effects and soundtrack – thanks to the power of Unreal Engine 4, you will live the most terrifying of experiences! - Back to the 90s… again! – if you loved the nostalgia of Daymare: 1998, in Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle will feel like you’re living and playing a typical action horror/film of the 90s. Expect to be transported back in time to many familiar references and a frightfully authentic atmosphere with a retro flavor. - Freeze! – there will certainly be no shortage of guns, but prepare to equip one of the most innovative and powerful weapons ever created: the Frost Grip!

After meticulously analyzing Meat Boy all throughout Super Meat Boy Forever (did you notice the cameras in the levels???), the nefarious Dr. Fetus now has all the data he needs to create the perfect Meat Boy clone! There’s just one problem: The DNA sample he’s collected isn’t a perfect specimen, which in turn yields some…less than perfect clones… But fear not, Dr. Fetus knows how to solve this problem.

"","2024-11-01","THE APOCALYPSE HAPPENED... In a desperate move to end all wars that have been rampaging the world for decades, the mages provoked The Cataclysm. Massive balls of pure magic obliterated nearly everything. A strange purple mist propagated everywhere, with hordes of bloodthirsty mutants coming at night. Our only hope is now to banish all magic from this accursed world by casting The Last Spell, requiring several days of uninterrupted incantation whilst a few strained Heroes try to protect those damned mages. The Last Spell is a tactical RPG with roguelite elements in which you have to defend a city against hordes of deadly enemies. During daytime, prepare your Heroes, carefully choose how to rebuild your Haven and position your defenses. Over the night, exterminate all the monsters coming at your walls with a large range of weapons and skills. Then heal, level up, and repeat until the Magic Seal is broken. FEATURES Turn-Based Tactical RPG: Ã¢—ï¿½ The whole RPG package: a flurry of stats, skills, perks, traits… and more. Ã¢—ï¿½ Tons of items: armors, weapons, trinkets and potions… with their own stats and skills, as well as optional random modifiers. Each weapon has its own skillset and playstyle! Ã¢—ï¿½ Build your own classes: upgrade your heroes with stat bonuses and perks, and equip whatever gear you wish. Want to make a glass cannon rogue/mage fighting with a gun? Do it! Ã¢—ï¿½ Manage your squad of heroes: they’re strong, but they are few and have access to limited resources. Healing and mana are scarce, so try to find a good balance. Hordes of Evil: Ã¢—ï¿½ Think and adapt: you will face swarms of deadly enemies with only a few hardened heroes. Optimize your positioning and plan your actions: big AOE attacks, crowd control, buffs, poison... Every Action Point counts towards another day of survival. Ã¢—ï¿½ Enemies have strengths and weaknesses that will challenge your wits. And because hard is not enough for us, be prepared for the terrifying Elites! Ã¢—ï¿½ Each map will end with epic fights against unique mind-bending bosses. Protect the Haven: Ã¢—ï¿½ Rebuild the city to help you in-between fights. Get healed, forge new magical weapons, get new heroes. Spend your resources wisely, commander! Ã¢—ï¿½ Build up your defenses: walls, traps, towers, catapults… every tiny bit of help is welcome. Ã¢—ï¿½ Protect the Magic Circle at all costs! If you lose it, humanity is doomed. Ã¢—ï¿½ 5 Havens to protect, each with their own setup and challenges requiring you to tailor your strategy to beat the Great Evil. Roguelite Elements: Ã¢—ï¿½ The game is meant to be hard. You will fail… A lot. But every time you do, you’ll grow harder, better, faster, stronger! Ã¢—ï¿½ Procedurally generated enemy waves, characters, weapons and a ton of unlockables will keep you entertained until the real world collapses. Ã¢—ï¿½ Tailor each run thanks to the Omens: a limited amount of bonuses that can be picked for the upcoming run. Do you prefer more Action Points, more characters, sturdier defenses, better loot? Experiment to find your preferred tools of destruction. Ã¢—ï¿½ Scale the difficulty to your liking, with 6 levels of Apocalypse to entertain even the most crazy hardcore players.","2024-10-17","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0613/103bc799353f562b710a34015ca09d895ed2f64556c8b194.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5539-PPSA09525_00-2899485575378333","40%","0","Role-Playing","437.5","null","null","The Last Spell","TRD","The Arcade Crew","2023-03-09","the-last-spell-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","0","525.00","1","",

It’s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE INFECTED Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.","2024-10-17","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/1512/35ead9b7fd1de13c76c33914969c350dc4149e5b7bb0e5d9.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DL2GAME0000000EU","60%","0","Unique","999999","null","null","Dying Light 2 Stay Human","TRD","TECHLAND SP.

But be forewarned, the scene you find yourself in, this breathtaking land of paint and oil is not always as straightforward as it appears. This intriguing world within the canvas holds more mysteries than even the artist intended. STORY Prague July 20th 1945 The city of Prague was under siege, ravaged by war. Buildings were falling, churches were burning, and everything was to be washed away forever. A painter lived there, isolated from the outside world. The worse the terrors of war became, the more the artist obsessively painted beautiful landscapes as a contrast to the evil he had witnessed. One night, a mysterious figure appeared in the house seemingly out of nowhere. The stranger walked slowly around the room, inspecting the paintings. He then sat down in front of the artist; to offer him a deal. The chance to enter one of his own creations, far away and free of war. But he would have to find his way back out before midnight, or else his soul would become trapped in the canvas forever. Feeling alone, on the edge of madness, terrorized by the scent of death creeping in from the streets, the artist shook the mysterious man's hand, accepting the deal. A few moments later, the house was empty.

"","2024-11-01","Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunt is a first-person hunting simulator where you hunt the largest and most dangerous beasts to ever exist – DINOSAURS. This game is a remaster of the classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter, delivered with a new game engine, improved graphics, advanced dinosaur behaviors, and seamless player progression. Experience an out of this world hunting experience, as you track down and stalk dinosaurs! To survive you'll need to know your target’s temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings, because you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end up being lunch. On your hunting adventure, you will visit beautiful but dangerous environments, each with their own unique Ecosystems. Explore the pristine beaches, dense jungles, rocky plains, and scorching deserts of planet FMM UV-32. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. You can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth tactics or gaining the high ground will give you an edge over the more vicious dinosaurs roaming the planet. Careful planning and consideration must be taken before every hunt including weapon choice. Will you use a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, or a silent crossbow? Maybe bring along a sidearm just in case. One of the most important items you will need is your handheld M.I.S.T. (Mobile Interstellar Satellite Transponder), which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking these beasts easier. There are other items you can bring on your hunt to improve your chances of survival such as Cover Scent, which masks your smell. You will track down a wide range of dinosaurs, each species with their own behavior patterns and intelligence levels - everything from ""pea-brained"" dummies to cunning apex predators, with heightened senses of sight, hearing, and smell. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species, each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, others will attack because they feel threatened, and the rest will kill anything that moves! So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted. Key Features: • Hunt down planet FMM UV-32’s most dangerous creatures – the Dinosaurs! • A multitude of different Dinosaurs, from Herbivores (plant eaters) to the Carnivores (meat eaters). • Realistic AI – Dinosaurs react to sight, sound, and smell – with differing reactions and characteristics. • Explore and hunt throughout all of planet FMM UV-32’s vast Ecosystems • Equip things like camouflage and Cover Scent to outsmart the dinosaurs. • A diverse range of weapons and equipment to hunt with. • Interactive Dinosaur Trophy Room. • Leaderboards including most money earned, high scores and max distance shots for every type of dinosaur.","2024-10-17","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/0915/6qq3rPzNJ70gGYecIFSMxNoN.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1082-CUSA23339_00-CARNIVORESGAME00","30%","0","Simulation","341.25","null","null","Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunt","TRD","Digital Dreams Entertainment Inc.","2021-05-03","carnivores-dinosaur-hunt-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","0","367.50","1","",

"","2024-11-01","Inspired by classic adventure games and the origins of the survival horror genre, Sense – A Cyberpunk Ghost Story celebrates the slow, cerebral creep of dread instead of relying on over-the-top action or jump scares. With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality. In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror.

"","2024-11-01","Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddy bear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?

"","2024-11-01","In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike! What could go wrong? As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.

You need to maneuver an ever-extending arm to grab the goal bottle, avoiding anything hazardous on the way. To make things more tricky, Grab the Bottle brings physics and puzzles to the mix. You must grab, pull and drop objects to get to the goal bottle. On the way you will find different kinds of obstacles that need to be dealt with. The story of the game begins in the 50s, somewhere in rural America, where one particularly strong minded baby is taking his first steps and discovers that anything is possible. Especially as he seems to have an infinitely stretchy arm. Grab the Bottle follows the life of this boy, from cradle to grave, solving many levels of puzzles inspired by “real life problems” on the way. Central element to the story is the specific craving for bottles the main character has. 1 player 510MB minimum save size HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Hotline Miami is a high-octane action game overflowing with raw brutality, hard-boiled gunplay and skull crushing close combat. Set in an alternative 1989 Miami, you will assume the role of a mysterious antihero on a murderous rampage against the shady underworld at the behest of voices on your answering machine. Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is the brutal conclusion to the Hotline Miami saga, set against a backdrop of escalating violence and retribution over spilled blood in the original game. Follow the paths of several distinct factions – each with their own questionable methods and uncertain motivations – as unforeseen consequences intersect and reality once again slips back into a brilliant haze of neon and bloodshed.","2024-10-17","/game/74081","https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/EP3643/CUSA00371_00/jbAOHNVd1f99SuBsKTg43DGK5jSgvMlp.png?w=200","12","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3643-CUSA00371_00-HLMBUNDLE0000000","75%","0","Action, Action, Action","139.8","null","null","Hotline Miami Collection","TRD","Devolver Digital","2017-10-09","hotline-miami-collection-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","13","174.75","1","",

(Shantae, River City Girls, Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp) comes Yars Rising, a 2D action adventure exploration of one of Atari’s richest, and best known classic titles. In WayForward’s experienced hands, the Yars franchise becomes an expansive mystery solved through 2D platforming action. Take control of the young hacker Emi Kimura, who is hired by a mysterious patron to infiltrate the shadowy QoTech corporation. Run, jump, sneak, and hack your way through challenges as you slowly unravel a complex secret shrouded in intrigue. Emi grows in power throughout her adventure, allowing her to retrace her steps and reach previously inaccessible and secret areas. Her evolving hacking skills are critical to solving stimulating minigames that reference the innovative gameplay from the Atari 2600 title Yars’ Revenge. The deeper into the QoTech facilities Emi ventures, the more expansive the sci-fi mystery becomes. A colorful cast of hacker allies help Emi discover her connection to a distant alien race and unlock powers unlike anything she could have imagined. Yars Rising celebrates the Yars franchise in WayForward’s distinct style of anime art, humor, retro game mechanics and storytelling virtuosity. Features: 2D Platforming Action: Emi must jump, blast and sneak her way past waves of robotic and alien enemies. Her latent powers are revealed as the game progresses, granting her wild augments and biohacks that let her reach previously inaccessible areas. A sprawling, interconnected map allows for hours of exploration Sci-Fi Intrigue: A seemingly bottomless mystery takes Emi from drab office buildings into hidden underground labs, and even to the farthest reaches of space as she uncovers the dark truth behind the QoTech corporation and discovers her own personal connection to an alien race. Challenging Retro Minigames: A series of hacking minigames pay homage to the original Yars’ Revenge, which fans love for its top-down, quick twitch gameplay. Stealth Traversal: Emi can’t always shoot or jump her way out of a jam – tense sections of stealth gameplay force her to duck into the shadows to hide from relentless security guards. Classic WayForward Aesthetics: With fantastically rendered 3D environments and an ensemble of captivating characters, the WayForward team brings Emi’s story to life as only they can.

The forbidden city of Akratya is an unforgiving land that cannot be conquered alone. Bind with fallen warriors found throughout your crusade and dynamically transform between characters seamlessly in mid-combat with the unique 4-hero party system. The fallen are individual characters with their own unique skill sets, combat styles, and rich history. By absorbing their essence, you inherit the fiber of their very being. Conflicts and synergies between characters greatly impact gameplay, so relationships must be balanced. Strong synergies may offer combat buffs that can spell disaster for the ruthless boss awaiting your steel and magic. Throughout combat, you will charge a sync meter shared across all characters. During an opportune moment, dispel your sync meter and unleash a devastating Morphstrike using the combined power of the bound fallen warriors. When faced with a formidable abomination, a precisely executed Morphstrike can be the deciding factor between life and death. The world of Deathbound has been lovingly crafted and influenced by the developer’s homeland of Brazil, a vibrant culture brimming with life, creativity, rhythm, and a rich history. From the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira to the sweeping music cascading through Akratya, Trialforge’s origins shine throughout every aspect of Deathbound.","2024-10-22","/game/132639","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202404/2514/1b70e6912e5732ecbffa339868c5b3d0129f4ecce4a8d4ce.png?w=200","11","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4385-PPSA21264_00-DEATHBOUND000001","30%","0","Role Playing Games, Action","545.35","null","null","Deathbound","TRD","Tate Multimedia Sp. z o.o.","2024-08-08","deathbound-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","839.00","13","587.30","0","",

"","2024-11-06","Purchasing this digital product includes both PS4 and PS5 versions of the game. The Return of the (Vi)king More than a decade after Volgarr the Viking’s chaotic, challenging debut, the barbarian king’s story continues in an uncompromising new form. Volgarr the Viking II is a hardcore, 2D action-platformer where precision is everything and one false move can spell a brutal death. Players of the original game will feel right at home on this relentless voyage, even with the addition of new power-ups, new forms of magic, new enemy types, and a chest-thumping new soundtrack. While the sequel delivers the same unforgiving 1980s-arcade level of difficulty as the original, Volgarr the Viking II also (mercifully, begrudgingly) offers modern quality-of-life options such as checkpoints, save states, and an undead mode. You decide how punishing your quest should be – but now anyone can be a viking! With new and larger worlds inspired by Norse mythology, multiple endings, and a variety of ruthless bosses to conquer, Volgarr the Viking II expands and improves on the original in every way. Draw your sword, don your helmet, and chop your way through this violent viking adventure!","2024-10-22","/game/151775","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2501/818e6bd404f58223012831de6be8255c3fbe0172458fb25c.png?w=200","2","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7816-PPSA15260_00-0063073300732616","20%","0","Action","532","null","null","Volgarr the Viking II","TRD","Digital Eclipse Entertainment Partners Co.","2024-08-06","volgarr-the-viking-ii-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","665.00","0","532.00","1","",

You can throw pigeons at people and watch as the panic ensues. Not fun enough? Upgrade your birds with explosives and let chaos reign. Still not satisfied? Wait until you see the fully upgraded pigeonado skill… Mix alcohol with stuff you found on the ground to create powerful mixtures. Drink them (if you dare) to get a boost, or throw them at your enemies for a devastating effect. Every bum needs a shopping cart of their own. Yours is named Carl and he’s your trusty mobile inventory. Also, he’s your best friend (no, really). You’ll learn to love him - we promise! Mutant sewer rat people from the ’80s? Mentally unstable clown with a hook for a hand? A bored rich man telling you to punch random people on the street? We have them all, and then some! You’ll meet them all while following the insane storyline (yes, this game has an actual story!) Day-to-day survival can be exhausting, so why not take a break and get some shut-eye in a cozy shelter? Conquer, construct, and customize your cardboard bases to your heart’s content. However, remember to build some defenses as the rival bum gang raids are inevitable! Crafting makes your life easier. Collect materials and process them to get upgrades and expansions to your base. Tired of searching for food? Construct pots and plant some vegetables. Need stronger pigeons? Better upgrade that coop.

"","2024-11-06","Bum Simulator is a sandbox game bursting with inappropriate humor and memorable characters. Apart from day-to-day survival, you can enjoy many unique features. You can throw pigeons at people and watch as the panic ensues. Not fun enough? Upgrade your birds with explosives and let chaos reign. Still not satisfied? Wait until you see the fully upgraded pigeonado skill… Mix alcohol with stuff you found on the ground to create powerful mixtures. Drink them (if you dare) to get a boost, or throw them at your enemies for a devastating effect. Every bum needs a shopping cart of their own. Yours is named Carl and he’s your trusty mobile inventory. Also, he’s your best friend (no, really). You’ll learn to love him - we promise! Mutant sewer rat people from the ’80s? Mentally unstable clown with a hook for a hand? A bored rich man telling you to punch random people on the street? We have them all, and then some! You’ll meet them all while following the insane storyline (yes, this game has an actual story!) Day-to-day survival can be exhausting, so why not take a break and get some shut-eye in a cozy shelter? Conquer, construct, and customize your cardboard bases to your heart’s content. However, remember to build some defenses as the rival bum gang raids are inevitable! Crafting makes your life easier. Collect materials and process them to get upgrades and expansions to your base. Tired of searching for food? Construct pots and plant some vegetables. Need stronger pigeons? Better upgrade that coop.

"","2024-11-06","Eternal Threads is a single-player, first-person story-driven puzzle game of time manipulation, choice and consequence. As an operative tasked with fixing corruption in the timestream, you have been sent to the North of England in May 2015, where six people died in a house fire. Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event. From the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely. You must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates. However, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone? Ultimately, everything is about choices and consequences. Features Choose how you want to follow the game’s story. The complete narrative follows the six main characters through multiple decisions across multiple timelines and you can experience these in any way you choose. You can concentrate on just one particular character’s storyline at a time, following their choices across the timelines and then go back to the start and follow another character. You can approach the story like a forensic detective, observe the final outcomes of the story and then work backwards along the timeline – essentially observing the effects and then determining their cause.

"","2024-11-06","Eternal Threads is a single-player, first-person story-driven puzzle game of time manipulation, choice and consequence. As an operative tasked with fixing corruption in the timestream, you have been sent to the North of England in May 2015, where six people died in a house fire. Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event. From the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely. You must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates. However, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone? Ultimately, everything is about choices and consequences. Features Choose how you want to follow the game’s story. The complete narrative follows the six main characters through multiple decisions across multiple timelines and you can experience these in any way you choose. You can concentrate on just one particular character’s storyline at a time, following their choices across the timelines and then go back to the start and follow another character. You can approach the story like a forensic detective, observe the final outcomes of the story and then work backwards along the timeline – essentially observing the effects and then determining their cause. Or you can just watch things in chronological order, experiencing the timeline unfold as you observe and change the decisions that the characters face as the week progresses.

"","2024-11-06","Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. Airstrip DLC It is more story-driven than what we did in the past and it allows you to build a small airstrip close to your gas station. Meet Joe Joe is an old pilot flying an old single engine plane. He is a bit strange and one day approaches you to help him with his endeavours. For that he needs a place to land in the middle of nowhere to make a stop halfway to his destination. In return he is willing to cut you in on his deals. The Airstrip You have plenty of space and as it turned out, there used to be an old military landing strip during WWII close to your gas station. Should be that hard to make it work again, right? You might even go a step further, order some aviation fuel and some parts for planes. A windsock wouldn’t probably hurt and some lights might turn out to be useful, since you will on occasion also need to help him land. Let’s see how things develop and what Joe is up to... The Plane Joe’s plane is like its pilot: old. It’s also simple. The most advanced technology on this thing is the LED reading light Joe uses to find his way on the chart. How hard can it be to fix some simple things on a small plane? And it’s not like you are doing it for free. The Gameplay The Airstrip DLC brings new game mechanics and content to Gas Station Simulator based on events. Unlike the content we introduced in the past, it does not require your constant attention, it is more something that happens every now and then.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/0811/b8f13605c8c28858ee9edb0a090601b63229b7a90f139710.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-0529173475105583","30%","0","Simulation","545.35","null","null","Gas Station Simulator and Airstrip DLC Bundle","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2024-05-16","gas-station-simulator-and-airstrip-dlc-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","839.00","0","587.30","1","",

Maybe one day, but for now he's too scared! ...anyway, Athenian Rhapsody is a super-fresh, one-of-a-kind comedy RPG in which you'll explore the World of Athens! Your goal is to build your very own Rhapsody - the story of you (the player) and your epic tale in this world. You'll be faced with many challenges, and you'll have to fight (or hug) your way through the world by either battling, or awkwardly trying to make friends with your opponents through esoteric knowledge, abstract jokes, memory games, and other strange and funny interactions. If you want more of the meat'n'cheese, well feast your eyes upon these rather dry descriptions, written by someone who's probably a little bit boring: - 16 Potential party members for you to interact with! - Each of these characters has a bold personality, and a large amount of depth for you to discover. You can choose to adventure with whoever you'd like! There truly is a favorite for everyone to bond with, I promise. - Tons of enemies for you to FIGHT or BEFRIEND! - This world has no shortage of intense battles with opponents that range from weird, wacky, tough, cute, and outright goofy! - Vigorous mental challenges, and intense puzzles! - You may face mind-bendingly difficult challenges such as ""Spell Richard"" and ""Carry A Feather"" throughout your Rhapsody. Would you dare come face to face with the infamous 3x3 slide puzzle? - Varying battle mechanics to always keep the action fresh! - Many characters will switch up the tactics of battle, you'll be faced with various minigames based on the scenario you find yourself in. - Absolutely hilarious. - This game is fast paced, action packed, and full of zany and ironic humor that anyone can have a nice laugh at. - Lots of rabbit holes, secrets, and suspicious endeavors! - You will NOT run out of things to do. If you do, you probably haven't seen the sunlight in quite some time! - Choose your own adventure! - Nothing substantial in this game is up to RNG. You choose your pathway from start to finish, creating an extremely specific pathway which'll then be recorded - this is your playthrough's Rhapsody, a narrated story of your journey through Athens! When you come to the end of the line and reflect upon your Rhapsody, could you say you did your best? - Last but not least... An Online Social System! - You'll be able to share Rhapsodies between your friends. Share, combine, read through, and maybe even delete your friend's Rhapsodies!

Explore the nature of good and evil, learn the true cost of power, and rise as a Mythic Hero capable of deeds beyond mortal expectations. Discover the Story Your path will lead you to the Worldwound, where the opening of a rift to the Abyss has unleashed all-consuming terror across the land. For over a century, the neighboring nations have fought fearlessly, trying to drive the enemy back — but to little avail. Now, you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel, backed by noble paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else entirely? Lead your army and challenge mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will leave you — and the world itself — forever changed. PLAY YOUR HERO, YOUR WAY Create any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset. Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle. FOR EVERY CHOICE, A CONSEQUENCE Your decisions have more weight than ever before. Your goal is clear, but you must forge your own path to it. Who will die, and who will live? Who will stay, and who will go? Make your choices, and watch the world around you change. A NEW WAY TO FIGHT Enjoy two combat modes as you slay your enemies – real-time with pause or turn-based. Switch between them on the fly, so you can always take things as slowly — or as quickly — as you like. The unique Pathfinder ruleset also allows you to perform advanced combat maneuvers, like mounted combat. Use them wisely! GATHER YOUR PARTY A cast of more than 10 unique companions is ready to join your cause. Earn their trust and respect, and they will have your back no matter what dangers lie ahead. And if you get on their bad side, well… Maybe it’s time to part ways. LEAD THE CRUSADE You will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of its demonic scourge. Take command of the crusaders and lead them to victory – both as a strategist, controlling the battle from above, and as a field commander, in a new tactical combat mode. CHOOSE YOUR PATH Explore nine unique Mythic Paths: obtain extraordinary abilities and shape everything that comes next. Your decisions might transform you into a celestial Angel, a raging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, an otherworldly Aeon, a rebellious Azata, a wise Gold Dragon, an insatiable Swarm That Walks — or remain mortal and walk the arduous path toward becoming a living Legend.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202404/0314/8a79dea36e354022fb6ccf11af1084899d860cce8c771730.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6008-PPSA15870_00-0475751594267531","70%","0","Role-Playing","0","null","null","Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition","TRD","Postmeta Games Limited","2024-03-28","pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-enhanced-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1399.00","0","419.70","1","",

Your kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner. Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen. And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter. A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests. Depending on your needs, wood cutters can clear cut or responsibly manage your forests.

"","2024-11-06","In Celebration of Violence is a fantasy action roguelike of exploration and murder. The methodical combat requires that you plan your attacks, dodges, blocks, and parries while considering your opponents and the environment. Death is permanent but you can improve your stats and purchase items to aid future lives. And if things get too tough then up to four local friends can grab controllers and aid the hero as player-controlled monsters, zombies, and bandits. The World Large, procedurally generated, and interconnected lands range from plains to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons, you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area’s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items. One must choose carefully though; every god has a different price and some become displeased when their rival is the subject of worship. Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians. Variety Scores of weapons, items, spells, and mementos are scattered throughout the world to find. One may acquire a powerful enchanted ballista early into one life, only for the next to yield nothing more than a couple of wooden clubs. Mementos represent objects remembered from past lives and change the rules of gameplay. You may discover a memento that summons spiders from enemy corpses, improves your stats while on fire, or reverses the effects of death. There are multiple paths to victory. One could be nimble and stealthy, charge in waving a hammer, raise an army of undead, harness a variety of spells, manipulate enemies into traps or flames, amass resources to acquire the most powerful items, or simply play it safe with a sword and a shield. The various characters simply offer different starting points, every decision is your own. Challenge No life is predetermined for success. The cheery graphics disguise a brutal and unyielding experience. Unforeseen obstacles will need to be dealt with in real time and even a regular enemy will be deadly if you’re not careful. To reach the end, players will need to demonstrate that they are able to consistently overcome these obstacles. Failure can halt or even reverse progress. As you accumulate experience, discover schematics, and defeat bosses you can become permanently better prepared to tackle future challenges. The choices and advantages a player has at the beginning of a playthrough will dramatically increase as they play. New characters, items, and bonuses are unlocked in ways that are only hinted at during gameplay.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/2711/594d0e532892337960f060de798e952ff115296f67d9f613.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6718-PPSA21627_00-0132056813808815","50%","0","Role-Playing","227.5","null","null","In Celebration of Violence","TRD","Dolores Entertainment S.L.","2024-03-14","in-celebration-of-violence-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","455.00","0","227.50","0","",

"","2024-11-06","Make Way is classic, top-down, multiplayer racing shifted up multiple gears. Grab track pieces from a pick n mix menu and snap them together to build your first course. Dodge hazards, unleash weaponry, and avoid falling off the edge in a chaotic rush to the finish line, then bolt on new track pieces for the next round. Scrap across ever-growing courses with increasingly perilous features until a winner is crowned before starting over with a brand-new course. Build your course Work together—or against one another—to quickly build tracks using a range of ridiculous pieces, including loops, seesaws, corkscrews, and even train crossings. Then add obstacles and power-ups. Ruin your friends’ race with a well-placed barrier or jettison them off the side of a curve with a crafty boost-pad. Blow up the competition Four racers jostle and shunt to cross checkpoints and reach the finish line. Obliterate opponents with a range of wacky weapons, including goo cannons and Tesla coils, but beware: each checkpoint acts as a respawn point and revenge is a dish best served via a giant mallet or rooftop-mounted shotgun… Keep on truckin’ The finish line isn’t the finish! Add new track pieces after each round to create monstrously large courses, and score bonus points with your performance to take home the trophy. Add to your collection Unlock new track pieces and hazards for more dangerous course designs. Add new vehicles to your garage to romp to victory in style. Key Features • Mix and match unique track pieces and hazards for near-endless course configurations • Fight for weapons and power-ups to gain the advantage • Unlock new track pieces and vehicles for wackier races • Up to four players, on the same screen or online with cross-platform multiplayer • Toggle traps and safety barriers on or off to make those twisty turns easier (or more perilous!) using fully customisable rulesets","2024-10-22","/game/130950","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/2512/5104e5a651d6591d6028a44935dce9c385f5d8dd2d86deec.png?w=200","1","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7072-PPSA16511_00-OOOOOOOOOMAKEWAY","40%","0","Casual, Family, Driving/Racing","315","null","null","Make Way","TRD","Secret Mode Limited","2024-01-15","make-way-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","315.00","1","",

An intense, arcade-style, 'bullet hell' SHMUP/STG in which you must master a vast array of ridiculous weaponry in order to defeat a race of evil aliens who are intent on abducting innocent civilians and turning them into mutants. Jetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern roguelikes. Don't expect a story. Do expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced 60fps action, big guns, and explosions! The Jetboard: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock. The Enemies: Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game's weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too… The Weapons: From the conventional to the ridiculous! Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission! and leave a path of total destruction in your wake. Get up close and dish out massive damage with the shotgun, wreak havoc with the cluster bomb, fry enemies to a crisp with the flame tornado or shock them into submission with the lightning bolt. You'll get a different selection of weapons with each playthrough and you'll need to master them all! The Bosses: Defeat huge bosses in a series of grueling multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use. Rendered in exquisite pixel-art detail, these guys will test your weapon-handling and evasive maneuvering to their limits. The Planets: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons.

The great grandpappy of adventure games will test you and tickle your problem-solving skills as you unearth its plot and secrets. Through cunning trial-and-error you will crawl through tight squeezes, encounter impressive caverns, collect inventory, locate treasure, thwart dwarf attacks, all while keeping your eye on the score before your lamp goes out. Dust off your vintage Colossal Cave maps from the 70s, they'll still work like a charm. This is a faithful tribute to the original game design. Developed in the mid-1970’s by amateur cave spelunker, this classic text-adventure was originally crafted as a way for a father to entertain his two young daughters. Will Crowther based his design on detailed cave maps he’d made with his wife, Patricia, of the Bedquilt section of Kentucky’s Mammoth cave. Family cave exploration is at the heart of this game. Shortly thereafter, the code-prankster, Don Woods, discovered the game on the ARPANET and expanded the cave. He layered in more fun, fantasy, puzzles, and a vexing 350-point system. Years later, Don’s expansion became the most accessible and the definitive version of Colossal Cave Adventure. Enter Roberta Williams. She first played the game in 1979 and was instantly hooked. She spent weeks playing, taking notes and mapping out the cave, as it was revealed through the textual descriptions in game. Her mind filled with imaginary neon mushrooms, misty underground lakes, a snappy bivalve mollusk, and a noticeably absent giant. After achieving all 350 points, she was ready for another adventure – a dilemma in 1979. If it was another adventure she wanted, she’d have to make her own... In 1980 she designed and developed the world’s first graphic computer game, Mystery House. This groundbreaking game is considered one of the most influential in history, establishing conventions that have become standard in the adventure genre. It has been ported to just about every computer and console, played by millions, and inspired many other games, books, movies, and TV series. Relive the golden age of adventure gaming. Immerse yourself in a timeless, sprawling cave system filled with treasures, creatures, and brain-teasing puzzles. Transport back to a more innocent time. Experience the retro-cool of yesteryear's gaming mechanics, accompanied by an art style that harkens back to the golden age of adventure games. This lovingly assembled tribute is brought to you by boutique studio, Cygnus Entertainment. Ken and Roberta Williams are committed to sharing and preserving the spirit of classic adventure games.

And don’t forget, Evil Otto may have a smile on his face, but he is deadly and invincible.

Arcade Mode: Survive an endless maze of random rooms that get progressively harder the further you get. You will know when you reach one of the five levels of increased difficulty when the robots change color. Challenge Mode: 20 hand-crafted mazes that deliver unique gameplay challenges.

Follow Rourke, young man trained from birth to be a sniper for The Core— a subterranean paramilitary state. On his first mission, he is sent to the surface under orders of great significance. Motivated to finally be able to show the fruits of his training, he carries out his first orders to perfection only to find out that The Core was far from being the noble organization he thought he knew.

Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself. Every location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world. Throughout the game you will open up new areas, acquire different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to comprehend the sights presented to you.

We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught! Get an Original Score and Digital Artbook from Moonshine Inc in Supporter Pack included in this bundle.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0410/e5bac608aebe1e0089d63e787a03d4b0cd9bd44f4cbf4d3d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA29034_00-0011653071129033","40%","0","Simulation, Strategy","769.45","null","null","Weedcraft Inc & Moonshine Inc Complete Bundle","TRD","Klabater","2023-08-24","weedcraft-inc-moonshine-inc-complete-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1399.00","0","839.40","1","",
"","2024-11-06","Virgo Versus The Zodiac is a sci-fi/fantasy JRPG with a focus on memorable characters and unique combat mechanics in which you play as an obsessed villain. The game features traditional turn-based combat with real-time execution of moves: blocking, countering and timing your attacks carefully as well as predicting your foes' moves is essential to succeed in your cosmic quest. In this galaxy where every action means a reaction, you’ll play as Virgo, the Holy Queen (often called Dreadful Queen by heretics). Guide Virgo as she embarks upon a twisted and unforgiving cosmic quest to bring back the Golden Age, a period of peace, symmetry and balance–or so she thinks. Bring mayhem to the Zodiac Realms and leave a trail of stardust on your way, all to help others conform to Virgo’s excessively righteous worldview and see the light. KEY FEATURES: A unique turn based combat system featuring timed-actions and counterattacks. No random encounters: every fight is a unique challenge designed specifically for the player. A focus on exploration and discovery, with multiple endings. Zodiac Memories: peer behind the veil to explore the backstories of the Zodiacs! Boss Rush Mode: face off against all of the game’s bosses in a gauntlet that will test your mastery and combat abilities. Take the dangerous route and fight off the Space Reptiles in an optional Action Filled Shoot’em Up Minigame!

Radio stations can't broadcast through the static. In the small coastal town of Camena, unnaturally occurring electromagnetic waves are suddenly causing interference with electrical and radio equipment. Reluctantly, Riley Poverly returns to her hometown to investigate the mystery, but what she finds is more than she bargained for. OXENFREE II: Lost Signals is the mind-bending follow-up to the critically-acclaimed narrative adventure game OXENFREE from Night School Studio. Play it as a standalone story or dive deeper by playing the original – it's up to you. As you play, you'll shape every step of the story through your choices. How you choose to deal with the supernatural events at hand will forever alter the future. Your choices matter. Shape everything through your conversations and dialogue choices. Forge a deep friendship with an old acquaintance from high school or opt to ignore a lost fisherman in need. Your choices impact who Riley becomes, your relationships, and the story options available to you at every turn. Start chatter from anywhere. Use an all-new walkie talkie conversation system to chat with contacts and uncover useful insights about the mysteries of Camena. Ask for info, check in with the locals, or completely ignore them. It's your call to make. And, it has consequences. Stop Parentage. Five years ago on nearby Edwards Island, a few teenagers unwittingly opened a portal, creating a rift between realities and timelines. Now, members of a mysterious cult-like group called Parentage are deliberately trying to open a new portal to pull something out. Who are they? What do they want? Are they trying to contact ghosts? Tune in to the radio. Ghostly signals are piercing through the frequencies of Camena. Tap into the eerie sounds and static using OXENFREE's signature radio mechanic. You’ll communicate with the supernatural, manipulate the world, and travel to the past by tuning into time tears: unnatural fissures in the time-space continuum. Save everyone and everything. Your future was on the line in OXENFREE and those stakes are even higher in OXENFREE II. Explore, climb, and rappel across Camena’s beautifully treacherous landscape. Take risks and see where it takes you. It might be dangerous. But it could also save the future. Not only for Riley but for everyone.

It mingles heavy subject matter with horrifying imagery and a deftly crafted story, culminating to a fever dream you 'll want to see through to the end."" - Ragequit GR Burnhouse Lane tells the story of Angie Weather, a one-foot-in-the-grave agency nurse attempting to complete five impossible tasks in order to win her life back. It’s a story about death, friendship, and everlasting hope that no matter how bad things get there is always a reason to go on. From Harvester Games, the makers of The Cat Lady (2012), Downfall (2016), and Lorelai (2019), comes a brand new horror experience that will not only take you to some truly dark places but will also make you smile and cry and question life and all the things we take for granted. Burnhouse Lane mixes elements of classic adventure games, choose-your-own-story (Telltale's The Walking Dead series) with light survival horror shooting mechanics inspired by Silent Hill and Resident Evil series where ammo is sparse, enemies hit hard and every shot counts. FEATURES ▪ 5D Chess - Solve classic adventure-style inventory puzzles, ▪ Mind Your Tongue - Experience branching dialogues and make decisions that shape how the story plays out ▪ Hands On The Wheel - Play through light platforming and combat sections ▪ Soundscapes From The Void - Original soundtrack by micAmic and guests ▪ I Ain’t Readin’ All That - Full English voice acting","2024-10-22","/game/117903","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2116/d8fbe5643cebed31c73def72e5be386802b04e4a8e1f0d58.png?w=200","11","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3385-PPSA16613_00-0174153754603115","60%","16","Horror","279.6","null","null","Burnhouse Lane","TRD","Feardemic","2023-07-01","burnhouse-lane-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","13","279.60","0","",

It mingles heavy subject matter with horrifying imagery and a deftly crafted story, culminating to a fever dream you 'll want to see through to the end."" - Ragequit GR Burnhouse Lane tells the story of Angie Weather, a one-foot-in-the-grave agency nurse attempting to complete five impossible tasks in order to win her life back. It’s a story about death, friendship, and everlasting hope that no matter how bad things get there is always a reason to go on.

We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner. You will progress through main missions, you’ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises... If you’ll be prospering, you’ll get the chance to create and manage bases in five different regions, each with its own, more and more challenging missions. From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there’ll be a pesky agent who’ll want to work with you, and there’ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You’re a free man, after all. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught! Features: [*]a faithful reflection of the moonshine craft - fermentation and distillation based on chemical formulas behaving as natural processes [*]a realistic recreation of an American moonshiner’s business, with all its challenges [*]a rich story - 3 possible successful endings or a “Game Over” if caught by the authorities [*]5 regions - running the base in the mountains, forest, swamps, town, and city, with linear progression [*]70+ recipes - 15+ moonshines, 15+ whiskies, 20 brandies, 20+ vodkas [*]50+ ingredients - sugars, fruits, vegetables, and grains [*]35+ apparatuses - 17 distillation stills, 8 fermentation tanks, 5 post-distillation tanks, 7 pre-fermentation apparatuses, and more [*]26 fermentation and distillation technologies [*]37 main quests + side quests and road events","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2313/facbfa26d3c303ebae4a6d664794d086354ad8fa580f06c4.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA16662_00-0822909442408128","45%","0","Simulator","349.5","null","null","Moonshine Inc.","TRD","Klabater","2023-06-27","moonshine-inc-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","384.45","1","",

All is well and orderly in a society run by robots, until the discovery of a library that contains everything that has, is, and will ever be written— the perfect harbinger of chaos.

When a state of emergency is suddenly declared, Ludovik finds himself in increasingly dangerous territory as he follows the murderer’s trail and unravels the mystery behind the Library’s sudden lockdown.

"","2024-11-06","Escape String is a 2D puzzle game set in an undefined time and place. A small humanoid robot wakes up in the debris of a landfill inside a large factory. He receives strange and enigmatic messages, from someone who apparently wants to help him. The robot's purpose is to explore the large factory where he is in search of answers about who he and his mysterious remote helper are. The player does not control the robot directly and in real time, but inserts movement commands above its display in order to tell the robot when it is time to jump, to crouch and more. It is therefore a puzzle game based on perspective: the player must calculate the spaces between the robot and the obstacles. The obstacles are initially totally static, but as they advance they will be more and more dynamic and varied. For example, we will have guard robots that will perform the same actions as our robot in a mirrored manner. There are currently 40 levels, with 8 types of obstacles. The real challenge will consist in finishing the level with the minimum possible number of indications (input) and providing these commands in a single line (string), ending the level while simultaneously satisfying these conditions will unlock the """"gold chip"""" of that particular level. The """"gold chip"""" will be used to unlock new skins for our robot. This title is therefore suitable both for those looking for a relaxing puzzle, given the non-dynamic gameplay, and for those looking for a challenge given its arcade nature. - Original puzzle game - Suitable for all ages - Many types of obstacles - Relaxing but with a good level of challenge - 40 levels, expandable - Original art sector - Skins for the character - No microtransactions","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0918/J74I6xtnTXOobXQ5SGU1zxnZ.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8151-CUSA37535_00-5946527224077423","70%","0","Puzzle","73.5","null","null","Escape String","TRD","7 RAVEN STUDIOS CO.

"","2024-11-06","Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom is a history-driven turn-based strategy set in World War 2. You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies. Possible alternate history flow - what would have happened if the Allies followed the ideas of Operation Unthinkable and went to war against the USSR in 1946? Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Advanced army manager - choose the composition of your forces. Acquire new units, upgrade or dismiss the outdated ones. Make sure that your forces have all the necessary tools for the upcoming battle. Real WW2 heroes - assign historical personalities to your armies and get access to special skills. Realistic 3D graphics - study the battle map and take advantage of 3D graphics, featuring volumetric terrain and physically-simulated movement of units. Attention to detail - game created by a team passionate about WW2 history.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0910/r28qdLdXatQ9aY1ux0GGRoQl.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA34476_00-8237173962609670","50%","0","Strategy","472.05","null","null","Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom","TRD","Klabater","2022-09-22","strategic-mind-fight-for-freedom-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","524.50","1","",

String together dodges, parries, jumps and devastating attacks to fight your way through Paris. Every fight will test your nerve and requires excellent discipline, while the huge relentless machine bosses demand patience and skill. AEGIS: A CHARACTER WITH EXTRAORDINARY SKILLS Define your own style and upgrade your abilities as you progress through the game. You can play as a ruthless warrior, a hard-hitting bodyguard, a deadly dancer or a virtuoso of the elemental arts. Take advantage of a wide variety of weapons and skills to approach each fight in your own unique way. REVOLUTIONARY PARIS IS YOUR PLAYGROUND Using carriages, grapples, secret passages, a detailed map, and other methods and tools you find along the way, explore a city experiencing its darkest days. Your grappling hook adds a new dimension to exploration and Paris's verticality. Combined with your dash ability, it will provide access to all the city's secrets across multiple levels you can explore over and over again. CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY You are one of the main characters of an alternative history where Paris is being choked by a tyrant king. Allies and enemies with unclear motives will cross your path, such as Marie-Antoinette, Lafayette and Robespierre. It's up to you to cut a path through all the plotting and put an end to one man's madness so that the French Revolution succeeds.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0510/tzGRl8cfpAdri2Cmrk2tEIbz.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA05063_00-STR00DELUXE00001","80%","0","Role-Playing","499.8","null","null","Steelrising - Bastille Edition","TRD","NACON SA","2022-09-08","steelrising-bastille-edition-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2499.00","0","499.80","0","",

"","2024-11-06","A surreal and punishing world of black, white and red awaits as you challenge the void of Back Again, a hardcore 3D platformer presented in immersive first-person perspective! In this void, your only means of escape is to cross floating platforms arranged in increasingly complex configurations. Obstacles move in patterns over and around them, forcing you to learn their movements to avoid getting knocked off a ledge or halted midair. Mannequins surround you, sometimes navigating the platforms themselves or simply observing. Perhaps they hold clues about the puzzles at hand, or perhaps they are just like you. Either way, they offer little comfort. Back Again is an eerie tale with a minimalistic narrative and unsettling atmosphere intended to test your skills, question your psyche and reward your determination, all set to a unique and ever-changing soundtrack to suit the mood. See the story to its end, retrying each sequence as many times as it takes, and once you’ve built up enough confidence, choose Survival Mode to see if you can clear the entire game in a single attempt! Features: • Walk, run and jump across platforms in a harsh 3D puzzle-scape! • Navigate shifting obstacles by learning their patterns. • Witness creepy events and engage in a light narrative! • Get immersed with a unique ever-changing soundtrack. • Push your platforming skills to the limit in Survival Mode!

"","2024-11-06","Paradox Error is a surreal take on the scrolling platformer format, combining minimalistic black-and-white presentation with self-aware, fourth wall breaking design. Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they’re part of the stage. The title screen’s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player’s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you’ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you’re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward. Features: • Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world! • Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective. • Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive. • Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style. • Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1807/7dfibDJZKkgabUv92WYt1h7E.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2005-PPSA06061_00-PARADOXERROR0000","70%","0","Action","52.5","null","null","Paradox Error","TRD","eastasiasoft","2022-07-14","paradox-error-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","175.00","0","52.50","0","",

But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they’d ever seen before.

"","2024-11-06","Paradox Error is a surreal take on the scrolling platformer format, combining minimalistic black-and-white presentation with self-aware, fourth wall breaking design. Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they’re part of the stage. The title screen’s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player’s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you’ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you’re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward. Features: • Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world! • Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective. • Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive. • Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style. • Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1807/7dfibDJZKkgabUv92WYt1h7E.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2005-CUSA27949_00-PARADOXERROR0000","70%","0","Action","37.5","null","null","Paradox Error","TRD","eastasiasoft","2021-06-08","paradox-error-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","125.00","0","37.50","1","",

"","2024-11-06","Timothy and the Mysterious Forest it’s an ""old school"" style with some modern-age ideas. A mix of retro graphics along with meta-narrative, stealth system and action combat with a high difficulty level. Timothy, a common child, wants to save his grandfather from certain death. The old man fell ill and he's now fighting for his life. Timothy, who loves his grandfather very much, decides to take a risky journey to the infamous Mysterious Forest. Legends speak of a magic mushroom able to cure any disease that grows into the forest. Timothy bravely begins his journey to find the magic mushroom. The game mixes elements from adventure/exploration games with puzzle and stealth: exploration, reading and keeping a slow pace is the best tactic. The high difficulty level is the base: Timothy is basically defenceless and dies with a single touch from enemies or traps. The world is full of ruins, graveyards and tombstones, caves, swamps and weird characters: every place is made to look wild, abandoned and dangerous. Except for Timothy's grandfather, most characters are often mean or clearly driven by not-so-nice feelings.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/1621/GxSFUAnK1bbIMBkNgWWsPRVc.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2696-CUSA25899_00-TIMOTHYPS4V10000","75%","0","Adventure, Action","41.85","null","null","Timothy and the Mysterious Forest","TRD","QUBICGAMES SP.

"","2024-11-06","In Mars Horizon, you take control of a major space agency, leading it from the dawn of the space age through to landing astronauts on Mars. Guide your agency through the space race and write your alternate history of space travel - any of the agencies can be the first to land on The Moon if you make the right choices. Manage the numerous challenges faced then and now: • Create your base with launch pads, research labs, astronaut training facilities, and much more • Construct your own custom vehicles from hundreds of combinations • Launch satellites and crewed spacecraft to explore the Solar System • Run mission control as you solve the various challenges of turn-based missions to earn scientific advancement and public support • Explore an extensive tech tree and compete or collaborate with other agencies to plot your roadmap to Mars • Choose from five unique space agencies, each with their own traits, base, vehicles, and spacecraft • Create your own custom space agency You’re in charge of every element of the journey into space: success rides on your decisions. Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet? Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies? Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars. Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors. Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment. These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue? Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We’ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5277-CUSA18418_00-0000000000000000","70%","0","Strategy","188.7","null","null","Mars Horizon","TRD","Secret Mode Limited","2020-11-17","mars-horizon-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","629.00","0","188.70","1","",

Feel object resistance, surface texture, damage feedback, heartbeat simulation and more thanks to the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. SYSTEM REDUX Veteran Observers can dive deeper into this dystopian reality thanks to three brand-new side cases to solve. “Errant Signal”, “Her Fearful Symmetry” and “It Runs in the Family” add another layer of depth to the game’s story while exploring thought-provoking themes of a future that soon might become our present. On top of that, System Redux offers expanded gameplay, which includes new game mechanics, new secrets to find, redesigned stealth, additional neural interrogations, and quality-of-life improvements made with the help of the Observer community. Newcomers get the chance to experience one of the most thrilling cyberpunk stories in all its next-gen glory: boasting 4K resolution, upgraded textures, new animations, models and effects, and transformed with jaw-dropping Ray-Tracing and HDR lighting. WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects’ minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion.

Join TY on a RIPPER of an adventure to free his family from the DREAMING and stop the nefarious evil genius BOSS CASS from removing mammals from the top of the food chain. To help you on your quest, you've got a BEAUT arsenal of boomerangs, sharp teeth, and the help of a few friends! So don’t be a galah - let's head down under, and have a CORKER of a time! BEAUTY, BOTTLER, BONZA! * Explore 17 levels of the Australian Outback in their old-school 3D platforming glory * 13 different boomerangs including the Frostyrang, Flamerang and powerful Doomerang * Improved camera & graphics; including updated shadows, reflections, HD resolutions and 60fps * New Gamemode called ""Hardcore Mode"" * New TY character skins * Audio Director's cut * Over 35 Trophies, including a Platinum Trophy, plus Speed Run and Time Attack Leaderboards. * * * * * G'day mate! Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open! Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie. Now let's get down to brass tacks, find those Talismans, and rescue your family!","2024-10-22","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1404/yxKq7R9s7eOf0aAyJvubLHnS.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5633-CUSA18068_00-7582797769000001","65%","0","Adventure","330.75","null","null","TY the Tasmanian Tiger HD","TRD","KROME INTERACTIVE","2020-07-25","ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-hd-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","945.00","0","330.75","1","",

"","2024-11-06","HIVE is a futuristic multiplayer hero shooter with a frenetic 2.5D side-scrolling gameplay. Up to 10 players can simultaneously fight in the Hexadiums, scenarios that are divided into 6 zones, each with its own gravity, different platforms, hideouts and open spaces, that turn them into a frenetic battlefield. In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle. This way, heroes will be an extension of each player’s style, creating an unique gameplay with hundreds of combinations.
