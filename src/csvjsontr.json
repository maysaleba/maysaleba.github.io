THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you\u2019re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you\u2019re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you\u2019ll discover choices in this world aren\u2019t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them.

Maintain their hope and contentment \u2013 the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small \u2013 like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction \u2013 but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don\u2019t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society\u2019s population.

It\u2019s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for \u2018marketing-related crimes\u2019. Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory. Return to Point & Click Swashbuckling Bringing classic point-and-click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze. Embark on Archipelago Adventures Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike. Created by a Legendary Crew The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series\u2019 creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights & Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck\u2019s Revenge).","SaleStarted":"2023-05-23","LowestPrice":"/game/109863","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/1822/9EgpieO87hFjIvMIxiUtLPnr.png?w=200","MainStory":10,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3643-PPSA10123_00-RTMIPS5SIEE00000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sahskKAxSCY","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":16,"genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":174.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/1822/9EgpieO87hFjIvMIxiUtLPnr.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/return-to-monkey-island","Title":"Return to Monkey Island","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Devolver Digital","ReleaseDate":"2022-11-08","Slug":"return-to-monkey-island-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/4V7gSa4duq","IsPS5":1,"Price":249,"MainExtra":11,"SalePrice":174.3,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"85","SaleEnds":"2023-06-07","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness. The game\u2019s cutscenes, quirky cast of characters, and the majestic Pacific Northwest vistas have been enhanced for an experience that delivers as much on its visual impact as its unnerving atmosphere.

WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects\u2019 minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion.

The Shadowrun Trilogy comprises 3 cult tactical RPG games taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which magic has re-awakened, bringing back to life creatures of high fantasy. Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades. Shadowrun Returns The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Nearly 10 years ago, creator Jordan Weisman returned to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city\u2019s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It\u2019s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge\u2019s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the \u201cFlux State\u201d controls the city of Berlin. It\u2019s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there\u2019s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return\u2026 Shadowrun Hong Kong - Extended Edition HONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. As an ex-con living in Seattle, you try to make an honest living but when your foster begs you to meet him in China, things turn grim and you find out the police are trying to arrest you. And by arrest, they mean to kill you on sight! Build your team of Shadowrunners, mercenaries with big personalities who can fight using mystical or technical powers, and turn the tables on the elite corporate and the police.

Based on the cult role-playing game and developed by specialists in the genre, Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Swansong is a narrative RPG in which your every choice determines the fate of the three main characters and of the Boston Camarilla. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF DARKNESS What if vampires were real? What if these bloodthirsty predators lived hidden among us in complex societies and had been hatching conspiracies for thousands of years? And what if you became one of them? In Vampire: The Masquerade, you play as these alluring monsters in a sophisticated world where the lines between the real and supernatural are always blurred. A HEART-POUNDING THRILLER Hazel Iversen, the Swan, is the new Prince of the Boston Camarilla. An iron hand in a velvet glove, she intends to assert her power and respect the Masquerade, the vampiric law designed to ensure humans never learn of the existence of these creatures of the night. But nothing works as planned. With rumours of plots, murders and power struggles, you must work in the shadows to protect your Sect in a pulsating investigation that plunges Boston into chaos. PLAY AS 3 ORIGINAL VAMPIRES Play as 3 vampires who are over a hundred years old. Progress in the game through their intertwined destinies, deal with their different points of view and use their character sheets to try to separate the truth from the lies. Each character has their own vampiric abilities and disciplines that you can upgrade individually to suit your preferred approach. Will you choose intimidation, seduction or stealth? It's your decision, as long as you can sate your Hunger for blood. GAMEPLAY WITH CONSEQUENCES With its unique gameplay, Swansong puts emphasis on the consequences of your actions in both the investigation and your social interactions with other characters. Analyse each situation carefully because your decisions can have huge consequences on your heroes' lives and the fate of the Boston Camarilla.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-23","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA07302_00-VTMS000000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7L7M0R8fzA","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":999999,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/vampire-the-masquerade---swansong","Title":"Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2022-05-19","Slug":"vampire-the-masquerade--swansong-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/7A8RefLzcn","IsPS5":1,"Price":599,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":239.6,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"64","SaleEnds":"2023-06-07","description":"With evil MEGATRON close to capturing The Allspark, BUMBLEBEE and the Autobots need a new commander to help restore peace \u2013 you!

Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne. Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.

In a desperate move to end all wars that have been rampaging the world for decades, the mages provoked The Cataclysm. Massive balls of pure magic obliterated nearly everything. A strange purple mist propagated everywhere, with hordes of bloodthirsty mutants coming at night. Our only hope is now to banish all magic from this accursed world by casting The Last Spell, requiring several days of uninterrupted incantation whilst a few strained Heroes try to protect those damned mages. The Last Spell is a tactical RPG with roguelite elements in which you have to defend a city against hordes of deadly enemies. During daytime, prepare your Heroes, carefully choose how to rebuild your Haven and position your defenses. Over the night, exterminate all the monsters coming at your walls with a large range of weapons and skills. Then heal, level up, and repeat until the Magic Seal is broken. FEATURES Turn-Based Tactical RPG: ● The whole RPG package: a flurry of stats, skills, perks, traits\u2026 and more. ● Tons of items: armors, weapons, trinkets and potions\u2026 with their own stats and skills, as well as optional random modifiers. Each weapon has its own skillset and playstyle! ● Build your own classes: upgrade your heroes with stat bonuses and perks, and equip whatever gear you wish. Want to make a glass cannon rogue/mage fighting with a gun? Do it! ● Manage your squad of heroes: they\u2019re strong, but they are few and have access to limited resources. Healing and mana are scarce, so try to find a good balance. Hordes of Evil: ● Think and adapt: you will face swarms of deadly enemies with only a few hardened heroes. Optimize your positioning and plan your actions: big AOE attacks, crowd control, buffs, poison... Every Action Point counts towards another day of survival. ● Enemies have strengths and weaknesses that will challenge your wits. And because hard is not enough for us, be prepared for the terrifying Elites! ● Each map will end with epic fights against unique mind-bending bosses. Protect the Haven: ● Rebuild the city to help you in-between fights. Get healed, forge new magical weapons, get new heroes. Spend your resources wisely, commander! ● Build up your defenses: walls, traps, towers, catapults\u2026 every tiny bit of help is welcome. ● Protect the Magic Circle at all costs! If you lose it, humanity is doomed. ● 5 Havens to protect, each with their own setup and challenges requiring you to tailor your strategy to beat the Great Evil. Roguelite Elements: ● The game is meant to be hard. You will fail\u2026 A lot. But every time you do, you\u2019ll grow harder, better, faster, stronger! ● Procedurally generated enemy waves, characters, weapons and a ton of unlockables will keep you entertained until the real world collapses. ● Tailor each run thanks to the Omens: a limited amount of bonuses that can be picked for the upcoming run. Do you prefer more Action Points, more characters, sturdier defenses, better loot? Experiment to find your preferred tools of destruction. ● Scale the difficulty to your liking, with 6 levels of Apocalypse to entertain even the most crazy hardcore players.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-23","LowestPrice":"/game/93160","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0613/103bc799353f562b710a34015ca09d895ed2f64556c8b194.png?w=200","MainStory":22,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5539-PPSA09525_00-2899485575378333","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":199.2,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0613/103bc799353f562b710a34015ca09d895ed2f64556c8b194.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Last Spell","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"The Arcade Crew","ReleaseDate":"2023-03-09","Slug":"the-last-spell-playstation-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":249,"MainExtra":43,"SalePrice":199.2,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-07","description":"Dreams are free.

Riders and shepherds on the great rangelands of Patagonia know not to follow la Luz Mala, the bad lights, when they flicker in the night. The wise warn the curious against being lured by the dancing phosphoresce. But the foolhardy are tempted by stories that la Luz Mala lead to riches and treasures. When those that are want to stray do, the luckiest find old bones and broken pots under the lights. The rest find their graves. The bad lights are strongest on days where rainfall is a distant memory, when canteens swill with dregs, and the earth cracks and gasps. On such a day, years ago, a girl was sent for water. She ignored her elder's advice and strayed towards the lights. She walked until it fell dark, and then further until it became bright. Lost, she spent days on the plain, sucking the moisture out of roots, until a plume of smoke ushered her homewards. At the base of the plume, she only found a massacre. After she buried her family, she saw the lights again on the horizon and set off after them, her despair mingled with a newfound veneration. The ranchers who committed the massacre also knew the legends of la Luz Mala, but did not fear them. They believed them to be some kind of natural luminescence, nothing more. But as the years wore on, and their hair greyed, when they saw the lights, they became more and more uneasy, as if the lights were looking back at them. Once their uneasiness set in, it soon blossomed into outright terror. Whenever the lights appeared, one of their number would turn up dead. The ranchers began to believe the stories that they were the spirits of the unquiet dead. Some chased the lights, daring them to fight. Others fled, new lights blinking into their path from the depths of the darkened plain. The girl spent too long as the ghost in the glow. She could no longer distinguish herself from la Luz Mala, and though her vengeance was sated, the lights still guided her on. The legend of the bad lights spread, and soon even the bayou was said to flicker with the threat of Luz Mala.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-23","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0510/XQ3HRTHL1LCINX9nj4gzaWka.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-THEHUNTGAME00049","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":69.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0510/XQ3HRTHL1LCINX9nj4gzaWka.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Hunt: Showdown - La Luz Mala","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Crytek Gmbh","ReleaseDate":"2023-01-25","Slug":"hunt-showdown--la-luz-mala-playstation-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":69.3,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-07","description":"World War Z: Aftermath is the ultimate co-op zombie shooter based on Paramount Pictures\u2019 blockbuster film, and the next evolution of the original hit World War Z that has now captivated over 20 million players.

Known as the Sisters of Battle, they heroically stride through the thickest fighting, shielded by their fanatical devotion and tempered by discipline at the peak of human capability. They stand against all heresy and will go to extreme lengths to root it out whenever and wherever it may be found. The Daughters of the Emperor A long standing order with a rich history, the Adepta Sororitas have always lived in service of the Emperor. Their unrelenting faith and rigorous training provides them with a mental fortitude rare among those that serve the Imperium. This divine protection, perhaps from the very spirit of the Emperor himself, makes every sister an incorruptible fortress that turns aside the profane, the blasphemous, the heretic. 15 units of the Order stand ready to turn back the unworthy on Baal. The sisters may call on the Emperor\u2019s Guidance through their HQ units, firing rounds that seemingly possess uncanny accuracy and inflict greater damage. Lead your Congregation Devotion and faith empowers the blood of the martyrs. None understands this more than the mighty Canoness. Defended by the Celestian Sacresants, she leads her sisters in matters of faith and duty. Every life given in glorious service to the Emperor drives her to greater feats in service and battle. The sisterhood reveres the lives given to the Emperor, inspiring them to greater feats and shielding them from the deadliest of blows. The canoness can bless her allies or curse her foes with empowered faith abilities. Her scorn itself is a powerful weapon that cows the unfaithful. Celestian Sacresants carry stout bulwarks that turn aside any damage that would target her. Command the Sinner It is not only the faithful that serve the Sisterhood. Those that have sinned in the eyes of the Emperor may yet atone for their crimes in service in battle, as Arco Flagellants. If a sister would seek such atonement, then she shall be given her chance to take the oath of the Repentia. The Sisters Repentia\u2019s devotion to reclaim the favour of the Emperor is absolute, they have no fear, and seek only forgiveness through deeds in battle. His spirit can push them to superhuman endurance, briefly increasing their movement and the movement of the sisters that fight alongside them. In Duty to Humanity The Adepta Sororitas are the champions of the poor, the weak, the helpless and the downtrodden. The Sister Hospitallers express their love for the Emperor's people through healing the sick and wounded. On the battlefield, though they are no less deadly than their counterparts, they can often be found in the rear lines, healing grievous injuries and counteracting deadly poisons. Rapidly returning the critically wounded to the front lines, to seek further service and glory in the eyes of The Emperor. The Sisters Hospitallers can restore hit points and remove status effects from their battle brethren, while still being capable units in their own right. Command the Faithful As the mighty Paragon Warsuit smashes down enemies with its enormous warblade, the Exorcist rains missiles on all around it.

A small humanoid robot wakes up in the debris of a landfill inside a large factory. He receives strange and enigmatic messages, from someone who apparently wants to help him. The robot's purpose is to explore the large factory where he is in search of answers about who he and his mysterious remote helper are. The player does not control the robot directly and in real time, but inserts movement commands above its display in order to tell the robot when it is time to jump, to crouch and more. It is therefore a puzzle game based on perspective: the player must calculate the spaces between the robot and the obstacles. The obstacles are initially totally static, but as they advance they will be more and more dynamic and varied. For example, we will have guard robots that will perform the same actions as our robot in a mirrored manner. There are currently 40 levels, with 8 types of obstacles. The real challenge will consist in finishing the level with the minimum possible number of indications (input) and providing these commands in a single line (string), ending the level while simultaneously satisfying these conditions will unlock the \"\"gold chip\"\" of that particular level. The \"\"gold chip\"\" will be used to unlock new skins for our robot. This title is therefore suitable both for those looking for a relaxing puzzle, given the non-dynamic gameplay, and for those looking for a challenge given its arcade nature. - Original puzzle game - Suitable for all ages - Many types of obstacles - Relaxing but with a good level of challenge - 40 levels, expandable - Original art sector - Skins for the character - No microtransactions","SaleStarted":"2023-05-23","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0918/J74I6xtnTXOobXQ5SGU1zxnZ.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8151-CUSA37535_00-5946527224077423","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Puzzle","PlusPrice":34.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0918/J74I6xtnTXOobXQ5SGU1zxnZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Escape String","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"7 RAVEN STUDIOS CO.

You'll have to earn it. Your companions have captured the German bunker during the Battle of Normandy, and your task is to defend it at all costs. Defend your bunker! It won't be easy though.

The enemy won't wait for you to get ready. The day is short. Many tasks await you. Prepare food to regain some strength. - Scavenging - The sky is full of enemy aircraft. It's hard to get enough supplies from your allies. You must scavage whatever you can to survive. Search the bodies of those killed in battle - sometimes you will even find chocolate! Remember to check the supply regularly as you must also take care of your companions. Order wisely and share food. - Encrypting - If you don't have enough bandages, food, or ammunition, send a message to the command with a request for a supply drop. It is mandatory to enter the password in the Morse code. Receive encrypted messages and anticipate your enemy's plans. - Shooting, killing, and destroying - This is why you are here. Perform missions - be vigilant and make good use of your machine gun, anti-aircraft gun, and anti-tank cannon. - Survive or Die - Take as many enemies with you as you can.

In its warm embrace, pain helped Damien fight his remorse and shatter his memories \u2013 a blessing bestowed by the Lord himself. But as the years passed, his scars \u2013 testimonies to his imperious devotion \u2013 grew. Festering wounds stretched across his body like vast mountains, burying his nerves deep beneath thick layers of scab and scar, and one day, his body became numb, and pain, his guide to salvation, abandoned him. Each jolt of pain had been marked by sweat, blood, and his inharmonious moans that had kept his demons at bay, but that night his whip travelled in the air for nothing. A candle\u2019s light, too weak to even illuminate the wax underneath, flickered once, then twice, as the whip rose and fell, ripping off skin and flesh, but delivering no pain but disappointment. Shadows danced with the flickering light as if to celebrate their arrival, and the demons, screaming louder than ever, greeted Damien mockingly. An anguished moan echoed in his sanctum, a crypt cloistered beneath the St. Francis Seraph Church, and Damien trembled in desperation as his demons resurfaced. Possessed by a need for the scape of pain, he did what he had to do to silence them, wrapping the parts of his body untouched by the whip with barbed wire. But it wasn\u2019t enough. Desperate, he skinned his own face and hid it behind a cloth bag dipped in salt. But the ecstasy was temporary. The candle\u2019s light died, and with it, hope. He stood in the dark surrounded by his past as memories flashed before his eyes: his wife, chest cut open, face shredded, and hands tied with her own intestines \u2013 her eyes fixed on him, as if begging for mercy that is never to come. Behind her, his son, limbs severed from joints, each nailed on a big cross and crudely sewn together, forming a sculpture of flesh, and Damien holding the shotgun he later dubbed Delirium, as a reminder of his sins. And through the frenzy of images, a voice spoke of peace, the promise too tempting to resist. With The Scourge in his hand, still dripping his own blood, he took his first step into the AHA branch in Louisiana, and the voices, now harmonious, welcomed him to the Hunt.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-23","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0609/CZnmpbFHDPreLN9y6npndZFJ.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-THEHUNTGAME00045","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":59.4,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0609/CZnmpbFHDPreLN9y6npndZFJ.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Hunt: Showdown \u2013 The Penitent","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Crytek Gmbh","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-22","Slug":"hunt-showdown--the-penitent-playstation-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":59.4,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-07","description":"The DELUXE EDITION contains: - The game SESSION: SKATE SIM - Péitruss skatepark in Luxembourg - A new training area: the Hangar - An exclusive prisoner outfit - 2 exclusive grip tapes AUTHENTIC GAMEPLAY With the dual stick controls, each stick represents one of your feet.

WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF DARKNESS What if vampires were real? What if these bloodthirsty predators lived hidden among us in complex societies and had been hatching conspiracies for thousands of years? And what if you became one of them? In Vampire: The Masquerade, you play as these alluring monsters in a sophisticated world where the lines between the real and supernatural are always blurred. A HEART-POUNDING THRILLER Hazel Iversen, the Swan, is the new Prince of the Boston Camarilla. An iron hand in a velvet glove, she intends to assert her power and respect the Masquerade, the vampiric law designed to ensure humans never learn of the existence of these creatures of the night. But nothing works as planned. With rumours of plots, murders and power struggles, you must work in the shadows to protect your Sect in a pulsating investigation that plunges Boston into chaos. PLAY AS 3 ORIGINAL VAMPIRES Play as 3 vampires who are over a hundred years old.

With less ammo around, the Resistance of Östertörn have started building their own weapons to keep fighting the machine invasion. Despite their more makeshift nature, these new weapons are proving to be both efficient and deadly. Mid-tier versions of these three resistance weapons can be found in the PLUNDRA storage box in Östertörn. If this is your first time playing the game, you will find them in the storage box at the Iboholmen Church. Higher tier versions of the weapons can also be found by taking the fight to the machines and looting the weapons from their wreckage. These weapons are: \u2022 Resistance Pitchfork - At first glance it could be dismissed as a simple farmer\u2019s tool, but this pitchfork has been reinforced and transformed into an effective Resistance weapon. The pitchfork has excellent reach, which is great for doing damage from a safer distance. \u2022 Resistance Heavy Bow - Built using scavenged machine parts, this heavy bow packs a powerful punch, but requires more skill to use. The enhanced power of the bow also allows it to fire heavy, modified arrows, making this a versatile tool. \u2022 Resistance Flamethrower - While it may look like an accident waiting to happen, the flamethrower's powerful napalm fuel causes massive damage to machines by sticking to them while it burns, quickly melting its vulnerable internal parts. Special weapon ammo and attachments include: \u2022 Resistance Standard Arrow - A regular arrow that does a lot of damage to components but is weak against armor. \u2022 Resistance Explosive Arrow - A special type of arrow that explodes on impact, dealing extra explosive damage to its target. \u2022 Resistance Flare Arrow - An arrow with an emergency flare attached. The lit flare will lure any enemy's attention and fire away from you and onto the flare, even if that flare is now pinned to another machine. \u2022 3-Pin Makeshift Bow Sight - This 3-Pin Bow sight features three pins calibrated to hit at a certain distance, working best when the distance to the target is known. \u2022 Large Flamethrower Tank - A larger tank that can hold more fuel, letting you relentlessly melt enemy machines for longer without needing to refuel.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-23","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2910/QAUfPaFQ3zo3RYLNLTbJOXjw.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5439-CUSA14212_00-RESISTANCEWEAPON","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Adventure","PlusPrice":27.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2910/QAUfPaFQ3zo3RYLNLTbJOXjw.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Generation Zero® - Resistance Weapons Pack","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Systemic Reaction AB","ReleaseDate":"2022-05-12","Slug":"generation-zero--resistance-weapons-pack-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":39,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":27.3,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-07","description":"Expand This War of Mine: Final Cut with three narrative-driven stories, each showing a different look on war: a father trying to protect his daughter, a radio broadcaster learning about the price of truth and a girl looking for the answer to what is more important\u2015the survival of a person or mankind\u2019s legacy, and with The Little Ones DLC exploring the hardships of war seen from a perspective of a child.

With the Earth scorched, water is liquid gold, and control of it is the truest form of power.

Until the day when that promising future is ripped away from her, leaving her half-dead and homeless, she becomes hellbent on taking down the system that ruined her and left her without a heart. Along the way she meets a diverse group of people sympathetic to her cause, every one with secrets of their own. With their help, perhaps she will find redemption, love, and most of all - vengeance.

Nothing strikes fear into your enemies more than a well-crafted piece of Samurai armor, and with 7 pieces to choose from, there's plenty of options. The additional 2 new weapons, and tactical are just the icing on the cake. That\u2019s not all, the 3 new weapon skins are just as important for your enemies as they are you, at least they\u2019ll know they\u2019ve been slain by the best looking weapons out there. Let them keep some dignity... The Cyber Warrior Pack contains: 2 NEW WEAPONS \u2022 Brosnan, a ballistic automatic rifle: low calibre ammunition combined with extreme exit speed allows for piercing bullets to cut through most obstacles, puncturing intestines and plating alike. \u2022 Interuptor, a new special weapon: stasis tech cleverly applied to live ammunition, allowing for great crowd control and pure blue chaos when used right! 1 NEW TACTICAL \u2022 PLM22 Surge, a lethal mine: mainly used as a defence against monobot and robot units, these charged proximity mines comes packed with a very strong digital blast that'll fry most nearby systems. 7 PIECES OF ARMOR \u2022 Feud Vest, Basic torso protection Light and unrestrictive. The Feud vest allows for great flexibility and doesn't hinder your movement. A good choice when speed and efficiency are important. \u2022 Feud Armor, medium torso protection The main piece in the Feud line. It offers full upper body protection without slowing you down. If you want a true Cyber Warrior experience, this is for you. \u2022 Feud Banner, advanced torso protection What could possibly make the Feud Armor better? It carries with it many of the properties from the original armor but with a slightly more premium build. \u2022 Nomad, basic head protection An old-school helmet that\u2019s mainly used when working outside of settlements in rough environments. Whilst not offering the latest in tech and features, it still provides solid protection against having your head bashed in. \u2022 Feud Mask, medium head protection The mark piece for the Cyber Warrior kit. You don't need to fake a smile with this on. It does a decent job of protecting your face while also boosting several aspects of the wearer. \u2022 Feud Helmet, advanced head protection The full headpiece for the Cyber Warrior kit. If you want to put fear in your enemies, this is the answer. Thanks to very light material, it allows for great manoeuvrability despite its large size. \u2022 Feud Trousers, medium leg protection A set of fairly neutral trousers that goes with the Cyber Warrior Feud set. Offering a safeguard against your shins, the Feud Trousers complete Cyber Warrior experience. 3 NEW WEAPON SKINS \u2022 2 new animated weapon skins: Glitch Green and Glitch Red \u2022 1 new weapon skin: Ultra Be the Samurai Cyber Warrior you deserve to be!

While this is still not enough to stave off the machine invasion, it should help the fighters tackle most situations and battles. Mid-tier versions of these three new US weapon models can be found in the PLUNDRA storage box in Östertörn. If this is your first time playing the game, you will find them in the storage box at the Iboholmen Church. Higher tier versions of the weapons can also be found by taking the fight to the machines and looting the weapons from their wreckage. These weapons are: \u2022 COM-10 SMG - The COM-10 is a high recoil yet very fast firing SMG that is sometimes used by the US army in special operations. \u2022 S21 - A sniper version of the classic S14 battle rifle with improved accuracy and adjustments to fit a scope mount. \u2022 G79 Grenade Launcher - The G79 was created by the US army to grant infantry an impressive mix of firepower, range and accuracy and at the same time achieve being more portable than a mortar.

But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King\u2019s blessing.

Our goal is to give a fun and realistic simulation experience of building and repairing these legendary machines. Customize the tank as you wish, use different camouflages, paint colors, decals etc. Find and extract tanks One of the ways to obtain a tank is to get it during the extraction mission. After finding the spot where the tank is underground, call for the excavation team. Prepare the tank for extraction, by pumping the mud out of the tank and then cleaning the tank from whatever's left. Finally, order the lifting of the tank onto the truck trailer, to finish the mission, and move the tank into the workshop.

Soviet soldiers in small and specialized forces have been seen in the northern regions using moveable defenses to set up temporary camps. They seem to be fighting the machines, but does that make them allies, or do they have their own motives for entering Swedish territory? The budding Resistance in Östertörn has come across several dead Soviet soldiers, armed with specialized USSR weapons that can be of great use to the Resistance as they learn to use them in the fight against FNIX. Mid-tier versions of these three Soviet weapon models will be available in any PLUNDRA storage box in Östertörn. If you\u2019re new to the game, you will find them in the storage box at the Iboholmen Church. For the higher-tiered versions, you will have to take the fight to the machines and loot the weapons from their wreckage. These weapons are: \u2022 Kotenok Sniper Rifle - This iconic semi-automatic designated marksman rifle is one of the most common weapons in the USSR. Deployed in a similar way as a machine gun, it can suppress an area with accurate gunfire, keeping your enemies at bay. \u2022 AT-WAD Assault Rifle - Used by special forces such as the Spetsnaz, this silenced automatic rifle features an integrated suppressor, allowing you to shoot more shots before potentially being discovered by your enemy. \u2022 RLG-7 (Rocket Launcher) - One of the most recognizable and widespread rocket-propelled grenade systems ever produced, the RGP-7 is as Soviet as they come. Utilized to fight armoured and fortified positions in almost every conflict since its creation, it should be perfect for taking down robots as well.

Forget everything you know about first-person shooters: Void Bastards asks you to take charge, not just point your gun and fire. Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you\u2019ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage... Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship\u2019s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don\u2019t worry though, as any crafting progress you\u2019ve made is retained from one to another.

Rolling hills, temperate rainforests, and deciduous forests combine to create a microcosm of the entire South Island of New Zealand. Watch the landscape shift before your very eyes as you trek across this beautiful reserve. While hunters make their way here in search of Sika Deer, Chamois, and Feral Goats, Te Awaroa National Park has also seen an influx of tourism due to the movies recently filmed in the area. It\u2019ll be up to you and warden Kiri Taylor to ensure that no permanent damage is done to the splendour of the reserve, and that its native flora and fauna are preserved. TE AWAROA\u2019S FAUNA Tracking the numerous animals that roam Te Awaroa\u2019s stunningly diverse environments is a favorite among hunters. For some, it\u2019s the rush of stalking a prized Sika Deer in the beech forest that draws them here, while others come in hopes of catching a rare glimpse of the Feral Pigs, Feral Goats, and Chamois. And for those looking for a more relaxed experience, there\u2019s plenty of Red Deer, Turkey, European Rabbits and Fallow Deer to hunt. THE NEW ZEALAND FLORA It\u2019s of no surprise that Te Awaroa has been used to depict fairytale landscapes, as it's ever-changing ecosystems are truly a sight to behold. From the steep, impressive mountains that divide the reserve, to the sparkling beaches and dense temperate forests, the region transforms under your very feet. There are also more familiar hunting grounds available, such as spruce and pine forests. VERSATILE SURPLUS RIFLE What the F.L. Sporter .303 lacks in condition, it more than makes up for in performance. The bolt action is smooth, reliable and easy to cycle, and it\u2019s a proven rifle for both hunting and target practice. With a wide selection of compatible sights, and a great effective range, it can take down a broad selection of animals without problem. MISSIONS AND MEASURES Stretching across a vast 25 square miles (64 square kilometers), Te Awaroa National Park has always been a place to get away from it all, both for the first Polynesian settlers and the hardy men who made their names hunting deer from helicopters. Times are tough though, and when warden Kiri Taylor reluctantly agrees to allow a series of Hollywood films to be made in the reserve, it goes from sleepy backwater to daytripper hotspot almost overnight. Now, with the reserve's delicate ecology threatened, Kiri has had enough. With you at her side, she\u2019s going to show the world that New Zealand isn\u2019t all just haka and halflings. Across 16 new story missions, you\u2019ll deal with local menaces, patch things up between old friends, and discover the truth behind a long-forgotten legend. SHARE THE EXPERIENCE You\u2019re able to hunt in Te Awaroa National Park even if you don\u2019t own the DLC by joining someone in multiplayer who does. This will give you access to everything except the narrative missions.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-23","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/2512/x0VzoSFmxZZHlwvtOWWMdNJn.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3359-CUSA08368_00-THCOTWTEAWAROA00","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Sports","PlusPrice":30.4,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/2512/x0VzoSFmxZZHlwvtOWWMdNJn.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"theHunter: Call of the Wild™ - Te Awaroa National Park","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Expansive Worlds AB","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-17","Slug":"thehunter-call-of-the-wild--te-awaroa-national-park-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":76,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":38,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-07","description":"The Outcast Engineer might not be an Engineers Guild graduate, but no less lethal - armed as he is with an array of experimental weaponry.

In Radio Commander situation reports are given to you in form of dramatic radio statements sent by troops fighting on the ground. And your only accessory is a strategic map, on which you can place tokens and notes. Radio Commander offers an unique experience very different from classic real time strategy games. It\u2019s a bold try to redefine the genre, as the player will be involved in a decision making process much more realistic than those pictured by casual RTS titles. Ask for situation reports. Listen what your men have to tell you. Send evac choppers and nape drops. Defeat the invisible enemy. Decide the fate of your soldiers. The choices you face will have a direct impact on the course of the game. They will also define views of your hero. Or maybe those are your views? Playing Radio Commander you must be prepared to answer tough questions about the righteousness of your actions, the price of a human life, and the toxic power of propaganda and stereotypes. Radio Commander includes: - 9 main campaign missions (every mission is possible to complete in several different ways), - 9 animated briefings, - 15 unit types, including: infantry, evac choppers, gunships, field artillery, aerial reconnaissance, M113 armored personnel carriers, and napalm-carrying F4 Phantom jets (every unit is described by a unique set of statistics and communicates with commander using a different voice), - full voice over, - over 200 dialogue blocks, used to construct radio messages, - over 600 story dialogues between units and the commander.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-23","LowestPrice":"/game/69329","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/1316/HwMgbPfNaI80QZxVvJvZamEw.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1549-CUSA25956_00-CLABS0RCM2020102","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubccklbVwo","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Simulator","PlusPrice":96.85,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/1316/HwMgbPfNaI80QZxVvJvZamEw.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Radio Commander","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PlayWay plc","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-25","Slug":"radio-commander-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":149,"MainExtra":8,"SalePrice":96.85,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-07","description":"The Super Kickers Ultimate Bundle offers all the content existing for Super Kickers League.

The old man fell ill and he's now fighting for his life. Timothy, who loves his grandfather very much, decides to take a risky journey to the infamous Mysterious Forest. Legends speak of a magic mushroom able to cure any disease that grows into the forest. Timothy bravely begins his journey to find the magic mushroom. The game mixes elements from adventure/exploration games with puzzle and stealth: exploration, reading and keeping a slow pace is the best tactic. The high difficulty level is the base: Timothy is basically defenceless and dies with a single touch from enemies or traps. The world is full of ruins, graveyards and tombstones, caves, swamps and weird characters: every place is made to look wild, abandoned and dangerous.

Only the scrappiest folks have managed to survive out here - like Rose, a tough-as-nails warrior who's as keen with a katana as a pistol, and Juno, a rugged brawler most locals call The Hatchet. To take down The Devil Riders, you'll need to learn new tricks to survive Gehenna. Indigenous plants and experiments left behind by a mysterious company open up new approaches to combat and exploration. The new Jetbeast vehicle acts as your trusty steed, a customizable hoverbike. All the while, an enigmatic narrator recounts the details of your rough-and-tumble heroics. Grab your six-shooter - or whatever fancy guns you Vault Hunters carry these days - and go put those damned Devil Riders in the ground.

Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction. Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons. Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race. Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war. Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura. Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene! Every corner of the game\u2019s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games. Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next. For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored. From enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-23","LowestPrice":"/game/69306","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/2913/ezrLujSSqsrrPwQto1UeAWgl.png?w=200","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5911-CUSA20344_00-RAJIANANCIENTEPI","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaSp7L0dSYI","PercentOff":"66%","Completionist":6,"genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":81.26,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/2913/ezrLujSSqsrrPwQto1UeAWgl.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Raji: An Ancient Epic","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SUPER DOT COM LTD","ReleaseDate":"2020-10-15","Slug":"raji-an-ancient-epic-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":239,"MainExtra":5,"SalePrice":81.26,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-06-07","description":"New career for Markus Kruber The Grail Knight is the pride of Bretonnia \u2013 a blessed warrior granted supernatural might by the mysterious Lady of the Lake.

To take down The Devil Riders, you'll need to learn new tricks to survive Gehenna. Indigenous plants and experiments left behind by a mysterious company open up new approaches to combat and exploration. The new Jetbeast vehicle acts as your trusty steed, a customizable hoverbike.

Step into the shoes of Sir Albert Wickes and The Right Honourable Clarence Baxter, two 19th century explorers who have chosen to pilot the HMS Fearful on its maiden voyage to Mars. When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park. It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece. For the solo voyager, the ship's computer-controlled cat will keep you company. Without a second pair of hands, Albert will need an extra dose of dexterity to navigate the challenges of Victorian space flight. The mix of action and thoughtful puzzles make 39 Days to Mars perfect for playing in short sessions. The entire adventure fits comfortably into an evening, or a long tea break.
