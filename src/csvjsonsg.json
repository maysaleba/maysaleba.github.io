Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest. \u2022 Bold New Beginning \u2014 His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive\u2026And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series\u2014satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative\u2014and fuses them anew. \u2022 A Second Chance \u2014 Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. \u2022 A Darker, More Elemental World \u2014 From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War\u2019s breathtakingly threatening landscape\u2014by far the largest in the franchise. \u2022 Vicious, Physical Combat \u2014 With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-13","LowestPrice":"/game/3974","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1021/X3WIAh63yKhRRiMohLoJMeQu.png?w=200","MainStory":9,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP9000-CUSA07413_00-00000000GODOFWAR","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLr5BeiTha4","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":12,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1021/X3WIAh63yKhRRiMohLoJMeQu.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/god-of-war","Title":"God of War (English, Korean, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Sony Interactive Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2018-04-19","Slug":"god-of-war-english-korean-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":28.9,"MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":14.45,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"93","SaleEnds":"2022-09-28","description":"RPG fans rejoice!

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-13","LowestPrice":"/game/68258","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","MainStory":15,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP1003-PPSA02532_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziktWnfJcA","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":33,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":33.96,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/deathloop","Title":"DEATHLOOP (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-13","Slug":"deathloop-simplified-chinese-english-korean-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":84.9,"MainExtra":22,"SalePrice":33.96,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"87","SaleEnds":"2022-09-28","description":"Players who purchased UNCHARTED 4: A Thief\u2019s End, UNCHARTED: The Lost Legacy, or UNCHARTED 4: A Thief\u2019s End and UNCHARTED: The Lost Legacy digital bundle have the option to pay SGD 13 to upgrade to UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection.

Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys.

We celebrate the lives we've been given, and offer up prayers for the next. *Save data from the demo can be carried over to this game. It is grief of death which shackles the living, and causes the dead to stray. Indeed, there is no greater affront to reincarnation. So we turn our grief to joy as we send the dead off with smiles. But the souls of those who held back their tears in life still need salvation in death. A duty that falls to the Watchers. Their task is to guide the wandering souls known as the Lost, and serve as keepers of the Living World and the Beyond. The Watchers sever the bonds that tie the Lost to this world, and send them on to the next. They navigate the emotions of the living and the dead. They prize life above all else. This is the story of one Watcher. ◆Features The player takes the role of Kagachi, a Watcher, as he travels between the Living World, the world of the living, and the Beyond, the world of the dead, saving the Lost. To fulfill his duty as a Watcher, Kagachi (the player) battles monsters by allowing Daemons to possess him, giving him access to a variety of job skills and abilities. Kagachi can bind up to four Daemons at the same time and switch between them in real time during combat with one simple press of a button. Each Daemon has a distinctive set of skills, a unique weapon such as a katana, spear, axe or scythe, and a different play style. Switch Daemons in and out of combat strategically to gain an advantage over your foes. ONINAKI has a weapon and Daemon customization system inspired by hack-and-slash games and an incredible amount of replay value. Enjoy a profound storyline highlighted by fast-paced action RPG gameplay.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-13","LowestPrice":"/game/65961","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/2912/DBBKVN8xOj9pQGaiVDO5ThBj.png?w=200","MainStory":19,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP0036-CUSA19508_00-ONINAKI000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bQWlOHbC8I","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":37,"genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":27.45,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/2912/DBBKVN8xOj9pQGaiVDO5ThBj.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/oninaki","Title":"ONINAKI (English/Chinese/Korean/Japanese Ver.)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"ARC SYSTEM WORKS Co.,Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2020-08-12","Slug":"oninaki-englishchinesekoreanjapanese-ver-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":54.9,"MainExtra":25,"SalePrice":27.45,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2022-09-28","description":"EDF, please save this hopeless world.

All the previous shinobi girls return with a host of upgraded moves to master, and new playable characters offer more challenges to conquer, along with a story that's equal parts sexy and shocking, serious and scandalous, busty and bouncy.

You are the last surviving Striver of Dibrom. Your duty, for which you have trained your whole life, is to defeat the Seven Acolytes, accursed and powerful beings, possessed by malevolent deities called Gahars. Challenging foes, mini-bosses, and memorable large-scale boss fights with fully orchestrated music, are central to the world of Morbid. To overcome these obstacles you must master the combat, as well as improve your character and gear through a wealth of elements such as Quests, Perks, Runes, Upgrades, and Looting. The Gahars have bound their twisted minds to the flesh of the Seven Acolytes, for without hosts they cannot survive. You must slay the Acolytes, thus ridding the Gahars of their flesh. Succeed, and you'll free the kingdom from the heavy yoke of their terror. Fail, and the malicious gods rule on, as the Acolytes rise anew, and madness prevails. -Experience epic, brutal boss encounters and explore a diverse array of environments -Perk levelling system with multiple ways to build your character -Deep, immersive lore with NPC's to meet throughout the world -Health, Stamina and Sanity management is important as you traverse the world","SaleStarted":"2022-09-13","LowestPrice":"/game/83854","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/2715/usiqtct5gNf8ilfuK3nFYhZv.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/UP1260-CUSA20472_00-0000000MORBIDUS1","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0I806pAHpE","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":9,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":8.97,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/2715/usiqtct5gNf8ilfuK3nFYhZv.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/morbid-the-seven-acolytes","Title":"Morbid: The Seven Acolytes (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Merge Games Limited","ReleaseDate":"2020-12-04","Slug":"morbid-the-seven-acolytes-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":29.9,"MainExtra":8,"SalePrice":8.97,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"61","SaleEnds":"2022-09-28","description":"Be the enemy of the world. \u201cWitch Disease\u201d \u2013 a curable disease affects only girls.

Beware of duplicate purchases. *This product is the Digital Deluxe Edition. Standard Edition are also available. [Game Description] The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki is a completely new game in the Kiseki series. The sprawling Republic of Calvard is experiencing an unprecedented economic boom brought on by post-war reparations. At the same time, feelings of uncertainty stemming from a massive influx of immigrants and bold political reform by the new president are rife. Deep within its capital city, a young Spriggan man receives a strange request that threatens to plunge the entire nation into chaos\u2026 [Prologue] The Spriggan is a type of undeground agent, born in the melting pot of diversity that is the Republic of Calvard. Spriggans take on any and all requests, acting as detectives, negotiators, or even as bounty hunters. They subcontract requests that the police can't handle, consult with citizens on matters that can't be brought to light, and even take on legitimate requests from criminals and underground forces. This earned them the apt nickname \"jack-of-all-trades\". In the year 1208, a well-to-do student dressed in the uniform of a prestigious school visits an old building located deep within the Republic's capital. The girl stares at the plaque, upon which Arkride Solutions Office is emblazoned in plain letters. She clears her throat and then knocks three times. \"How odd, we don't receive many callers before noon...\" The calm voice of a surprisingly young, though mature-sounding man is heard from within, and the doorknob slowly starts to turn. And thus, our story begins.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-13","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/0701/6K0WE5g3uTqE92ribQ39uWwi.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP5846-PPSA07728_00-KURONOKISEKIDE01","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":84.96,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/0701/6K0WE5g3uTqE92ribQ39uWwi.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki Digital Deluxe Edition (Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"CLOUDED LEOPARD ENTERTAINMENT INC.","ReleaseDate":"2022-07-27","Slug":"the-legend-of-heroes-kuro-no-kiseki-digital-deluxe-edition-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":106.2,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":84.96,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-28","description":"Enter the glowing wireframe arenas of Devastator, a retro twin-stick shooter inspired by arcade classics, featuring top-down 3D presentation and intense shoot\u2019em up combat!

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

[Game Description] The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki is a completely new game in the Kiseki series. The sprawling Republic of Calvard is experiencing an unprecedented economic boom brought on by post-war reparations. At the same time, feelings of uncertainty stemming from a massive influx of immigrants and bold political reform by the new president are rife. Deep within its capital city, a young Spriggan man receives a strange request that threatens to plunge the entire nation into chaos\u2026 [Prologue] The Spriggan is a type of undeground agent, born in the melting pot of diversity that is the Republic of Calvard.

Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny. In Evertried, the player\u2019s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don\u2019t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-13","LowestPrice":"/game/98461","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/JP4108-CUSA28220_00-EVERTRIEDPS4JP00","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImOYOo4RR4","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Strategy, Strategy","PlusPrice":16.74,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Evertried (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Dangen Entertainment Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-20","Slug":"evertried-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":27.9,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":16.74,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-28","description":"Sheepo is a quirky metroidvania platformer featuring a shape-shifting sheep-thing, who must traverse an uncharted planet in order to collect samples of each living species for an intergalactic species database.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

Long ago it was the home of the brilliant and yet dangerous alchemists, but now lies abandoned and devastated. You play as Mya, an alchemist who has just woken up and finds herself in an unknown place, confused and with no memories of what happened. To explore the world you will need to use the power gained through combining the four elements \u2014 fire, water, air, earth \u2014 along with various ingredients. By making different potions, you will be able to explore the regions, solve alchemical puzzles, and fight dreadful enemies. Unveil the secrets of the mysterious world and discover your story! Key Features - Discover the mysterious world \u2014 During the game you will travel through different locations, from laboratories and dungeons, to the factory inside a volcano. Each region has many challenges, hidden secrets, different enemies to fight, and lore to discover. - Combine elements and make all kinds of potions \u2014 Use the four basic elements (fire, water, air, earth) along with special ingredients (from cuprum to nigredo) to create bombs, elixirs, and sword oils. - Transform the world around you \u2014 Interact with the environment using alchemy. Raise the water level of a lake, cross a river by creating ice platforms, use the wind to move objects, and create lightning to start an engine! - Solve alchemical puzzles \u2014 Combine elements to open chests, make paths, or find hidden objects. - Fight all kinds of monsters \u2014 Use elements to discover enemies\u2019 weaknesses and try different strategies to defeat them. - Switch between characters or play co-op \u2014 Join the journey as a flying homunculus that can fight, solve puzzles, collect resources, and play with a friend! Discover Isur For a long time, Isur was the capital of the region ruled by the alchemists, and thanks to the volcano that provided powerful resources, it was a thriving trade port. Ruled by the Council of Seven Master Alchemists, the city was known as a place where you can buy everything and, if you\u2019re lucky, even gain some of the alchemists\u2019 knowledge. Not many were chosen to become alchemists, and the Council always guarded their secrets carefully. Your journey will take place in 4 themed regions that are all connected to the central area. Combine Elements The alchemy system plays a central role in the game and you are free to create your own potions as there are no limitations or predetermined recipes. To create a potion, you will need to use one or several of the 4 primary elements: fire, water, air, and earth. Combining them and adding special ingredients will open up new possibilities and effects.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-13","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/0123/mjsGySgu6QXm0yoAcBVP6nbl.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP5036-CUSA24984_00-CHEMISTADVENTURE","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":13.95,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/0123/mjsGySgu6QXm0yoAcBVP6nbl.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Alchemist Adventure (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"INTRAGAMES","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-19","Slug":"alchemist-adventure-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":27.9,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":13.95,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-28","description":"Become a Portal Knight in legendary fashion!

This story takes place three years after the events of the previous game \u201cAtelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout,\u201d and depicts the reunion of Ryza and her friends, who go through new encounters and goodbyes to discover a true priceless treasure. 《The Story》 Three years have passed since Ryza\u2019s secret grand adventure on Kurken Island. Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life. 《Main Features》 ■ Exploring with new field actions! Ryza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively. ■ More action-filled real-time battles! Take on your enemies using an improved \u201creal-time tactics\u201d battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever. Speedily switch between characters, choose varied skills, and utilize items in just the right moments for best results. ■ Straightforward and easy-to-use synthesis!

The story of Aya and Saki, two sisters bound by mutual hatred and locked in a brutal fight to the death, has been revived and reimagined. Main character designer Katsumi Enami breathes new life into the characters, making this silky-smooth 60fps high-speed action game an unmissable treat. All shall be revealed in this reimagined rerelease of the games that started it all in Onee Chanbara Origin! The Story In the year 20XX AD, Tokyo is nothing but a dystopic wasteland overrun by living corpses known as the Undead. Here we find two sisters who descend from a long line of expert swordsmen, yet were born to different mothers. The elder sister, Aya, was raised by her father, who subjected her to rigorous training in the way of the blade. Meanwhile, the younger sister, Saki, was raised by her mother, learning to despise her father for abandoning them and taking her sister away. When her father goes missing, Aya decides to put her skills with the sword to use as an Undead-hunter. Upon her beloved mother's murder, Saki becomes consumed to the point of insanity with a desperate thirst for revenge, resorting to manipulating the Undead to achieve her goal. Aya resolves to seek out her younger sister, her only surviving relation, while Saki is determined to resurrect her mother using an ancient art passed down through the ages. This art, however, requires the heart of a blood relative to work, meaning that the younger sister must kill the elder if she is to have her sworn vengeance. And so, amidst a swirling storm of love, hate, and intrigue, the battle between the two sisters begins.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-13","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/1212/JL1dPZD2SerLAl8ZWBRBdaBi.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP5846-CUSA19217_00-ANEZ3GAMEDX00000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":34.14,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/1212/JL1dPZD2SerLAl8ZWBRBdaBi.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"OneeChanbara ORIGIN Deluxe Edition (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"CLOUDED LEOPARD ENTERTAINMENT INC.","ReleaseDate":"2020-09-24","Slug":"oneechanbara-origin-deluxe-edition-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":113.8,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":34.14,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-28","description":"The Kerbal Space Program Enhanced Edition Complete bundle includes the heavily-awarded and ever evolving space simulation game Kerbal Space Program as well as the History and Parts Pack & Breaking Ground expansion for a bundled discount.

Razmi is discouraged by Ajna's continued success but is determined to make Ajna look foolish, so keeps coming up with new absurd challenges. As the player continues, other fan-favourite characters tell Razmi that it is getting to be too much, which Razmi stubbornly ignores. \u2022 Missions are gated by players\u2019 current story progress.

From the team that brought you SENRAN KAGURA and VALKYRIE DRIVE comes the brand-new Kandagawa Jet Girls Project! Kandagawa Jet Girls is an exhilarating racing game that takes place in a fictional version of Tokyo, sometime in the near future. A hot-blooded story unfolds among teams of young girls who pilot river-running jet machines. Teams consist of a Jetter, who pilots the jet machine, and an offensive Shooter, who attacks opponents with their water guns from the jet machine\u2019s rear. Together, these teams dash into the water in competitive jet races! Explore myriad courses across Tokyo, customize your characters and machines, and challenge Time Attack Mode! Up to four players can compete against their rivals in online matches. --- Enter Rin Namiki, a young lady whose mother was once a legendary Jetter. She dreams of becoming a jet racer herself, leaving her home island and setting out to Asakusa, Tokyo. She encounters the aloof and beautiful Misa Aoi, and the two become partners. Little by little, the two deepen their bond as they race against 12 rivals. This is the story of passionate girls, devoting their youth to the jet races. An all-new story awaits, with twists and turns that deviate from the anime adaptation.

The core mechanics are simple and accessible, but hard to master and combat is fierce. Loot treasure chests for game-changing power-ups, master the art of catching arrows out of the air, or descend on your foes and stomp them into submission. TowerFall is best played competitively with friends, cross-legged on the floor within punching distance of each other. New in Ascension is the 1- or 2-player co-op Quest mode. Players work together, fighting off a variety of monsters and enemy archers across the land of TowerFall. It's a new adventure to explore when you don't have more friends handy to square off against.

Fueled by the next-generation power and fidelity of Frostbite™ 3, Battlefield 4 provides a visceral, dramatic experience unlike any other. Only in Battlefield will you blow the foundations of a dam or reduce an entire skyscraper to rubble, or lead a naval assault from the back of a gun boat. Battlefield grants you the freedom to do more and be more while playing to your strengths and carving your own path to victory. In addition to its hallmark multiplayer, Battlefield 4 features an intense and dramatic character-driven campaign that starts with the evacuation of American VIPs from Shanghai and follows your squad's struggle to find its way home. There is no comparison. Immerse yourself in the glorious chaos of all-out war, found only in Battlefield. Copyright: ©2013 Electronic Arts Inc.
