Enter a labyrinth that moves as you move, where mastering the elements is key to defeating enemies and uncovering the mysteries of this underground world. With a new experience awaiting every time you enter the dungeon, let the power bestowed by the crown guide you in this challenging adventure! Procedurally Generated Maze The procedurally-generated maze ensures you have a different experience every time you enter the dungeon. But unlike traditional open maps, Crown Trick locks you inside a small dungeon room to do battle with monsters. Without access to the entire map, you have no choice but to strategically decide how you will mount an attack on the enemy. Synchronous Turn-Based Strategy The game moves as you move, and your enemies will stand still until you decide what\u2019s the best way to attack. Take however long you need to map out your route, decide the best way to avoid traps, or how to use the elements to your advantage. A carefully thought out strategy is the key to escaping this dungeon alive. Use the Environment As you go deeper into the dungeon you will come across terrains mirroring a variety of elements that can be combined with your skills to deal heavy damage to the enemy.

You are the last surviving Striver of Dibrom. Your duty, for which you have trained your whole life, is to defeat the Seven Acolytes, accursed and powerful beings, possessed by malevolent deities called Gahars. Challenging foes, mini-bosses, and memorable large-scale boss fights with fully orchestrated music, are central to the world of Morbid. To overcome these obstacles you must master the combat, as well as improve your character and gear through a wealth of elements such as Quests, Perks, Runes, Upgrades, and Looting.

Amazing techno beats and beautiful visuals set the stage for a game that honors the long forgotten falling block puzzle genre. Fresh but familiar gameplay ensures that Ekstase is easy to pick up and sink many hours into. With both classic and new game modes, there is something here for both the casual and the hardcore puzzle game player. Gameplay description In Ekstase, shapes of 3-5 blocks fall from the top, and as soon as they hit something, they fall apart. The scan line changes color every cycle and removes the squares you formed with blocks of the same color. Game modes Reach a \"state-of-flow\" in Flow mode Flow mode is the frictionless \"jump in\" game mode in which the game adapts to how you play. Are you getting better? The game will ramp up its difficulty. Are you getting worse? The game becomes easier. In doing so, the game teases out a \"state-of-flow\" in the player, a state in which you are fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, involvement, and enjoyment. Keep a beat with Beat99 Beat99 is the rhythm mode in Ekstase . The goal is to rank up your multiplier by dropping shapes to the beat. You'll be given 99 \"lives\", dropping a shape subtracts one life, missing a beat subtracts ten! Try to survive as long as possible and try to score as high as you possibly can.

During each one of them you\u2019ll play at least two out of three possible game modes: Shortbow - a quick, 30-second long round where your reflexes and fast aiming skills will be put to the test. Longbow - a longer round with 3 shots for each of the players. The distance to the target will increase after each shot, so you\u2019ll have to be mindful of gravity and wind!

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"40%","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.66","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"30.75","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"112","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"7.22","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"39.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"6.49","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-01-06","LowestPrice":"4.99","SaleStarted":"2021-12-16","description":"Rodents! - Mouse - Scout - Capybara - Knight - Porcupine - Barbarian - Beaver - Wizard - Rat - Necromancer - Weasel - Swashbuckler - Every rodent has unique skills which get stronger as you use them - Every rodent hero has a unique back story - Every rodent hero has a unique list of challenges that limit their power Progression! - Power progression mechanic based on reincarnation - Every time a hero is defeated, subsequent heroes will be given power bonuses - By overcoming challenges all future heroes have an even greater potential to be more powerful Quests! - Seven quest zones - Forest - Desert - Jungle - Snow - Jungle - Mountain - Grassland - Parallax scrolling environments - Interactive dialogues with different Quests available depending on your progress - Take place inside of a maze - Mini map - Fog of war - Dynamic lighting with day / night cycle Enemies! - 50+ Enemies, including bosses - Each enemy has unique stats based on their classification - Tanky (Bonus health) - Vicious (Bonus damage) - Speedster (Bonus move speed) - Hyper (Bonus attack speed) - Hardened (Bonus defense) - Accurate (Bonus attack accuracy) - Have different abilities - Charge - Runs towards the Hero and does damage on impact - Ranged Attack - Fires projectiles - Ranged Bomber - Lobs projectiles that do damage on impact - Change Sides - Change from left side of Hero to right side or vice versa - Protector - Takes less damage and blocks projectiles\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RodentWarriors_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rodent-warriors-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Adventure,Action,Fighting,Role-Playing","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7.50","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RodentWarriors.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"90","BrazilPrice":"24.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"374","Title":"Rodent Warriors","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"JanduSoft","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-18","Slug":"rodent-warriors-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"20","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"110","SalePrice":"4.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-01-14","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2021-12-24","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia. Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds. Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay.

The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles. Leveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area. Players are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far. The type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animus-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"63%","genre":"Action,Role-Playing,Arcade,Fighting","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"4.80","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"48.10","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"221","Title":"ANIMUS","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"TROOOZE","ReleaseDate":"2019-01-03","Slug":"animus-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"14.05","ChilePrice":"","Price":"7.99","MexicoPrice":"55.13","SalePrice":"2.95"},{"CanadaPrice":"4.93","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-01-13","LowestPrice":"3.99","SaleStarted":"2021-12-23","description":"\"CRAZY CLIMBER2\" is an action game released by Nichibutsu in 1988.

This romance adventure game is set in Akihabara, where you'll enjoy your new, slightly naughty roommate life with laughter, tears, and the friendship of two female ninja. A young man is dazing off while working the night shift at a convenience store, when a girl stops in to ask for a meat bun. The one next to her appears to be her boyfriend, and after doing their shopping, the two of them link arms affectionately and take off. Just when the young man is thinking how nice it would be to have a girlfriend, a pair of girls in ninja cosplay show up. The girls just stare at the shop goods without buying anything in particular. Even worse, they're even chatting about ninja techniques or something along those lines. When he calls out to them to prevent theft, it becomes apparent that they have no money. Despite suspecting that they might try to steal something, he gives in and buys a bento for the two desperately pleading girls. The life of that young man is turned upside down from the moment of his encounter with the two young women. Illustration:AkasaAi Scenario:Linkedbrain Inc.
