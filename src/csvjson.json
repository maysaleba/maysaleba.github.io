Passive Co-Op Multiplayer As you adventure through Ashen, you'll occasionally encounter other players in a massive open world, akin to the passive multiplayer of Journey. It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore them. Souls with a Twist Ashen is faithful to the \"souls\" genre of stamina-based combat, introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world. But here\u2019s the twist - no two gameplay experiences are alike. Whether you\u2019re exploring bogs, investigating a fjord or pillaging an old palace, where you are at any given moment will dramatically alter the course of your adventure. It's a brutal open world; you're just living in it. Creatures + Combat Ashen has no shortage of dangerous encounters, from hostile enemies to indigenous creatures. You'll be rewarded for studying the environment and its inhabitants, planning your adventure rather than flying by the seat of your pants. The flora and fauna within the world aren't just fantastical; they're often fatal. Each confrontation, no matter how trivial, has potentially dire consequences. Crafting is Key As you discover survivors, you'll have the choice to invite them to your Town. But these aren't mere adventurers - they're potential collaborators, bringing a plethora of crafting skills, from blacksmithing to foraging expertise, in tow.

For centuries the kingdom has been at odds with neighboring Nostria, but now first steps are being undertaken toward a lasting peace. But a plague of crows troubles the king, for the birds are acting with unusual aggressiveness, even attacking humans. Moreover, there are those among the citizens of Andergast who swear that the crows are bringing them dark nightmares. As the belligerent creatures infiltrate even the castle itself, the king seeks a skilled bird catcher - an opportunity for young Geron to prove that the reputation for ill luck that has followed him since childhood is undeserved.

Away from home, Donna seeks teenage thrills with her friends Becky and Vivek, but gets more than she bargained for when the trio become unexpected kidnappers in a game of amateur detective gone wrong. - John, an overworked middle-aged single dad. Burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent, John jealously pines after the free and easy life of his twenty-something bachelor neighbour, Jack. When the pair unwittingly fall foul of a vengeful stranger, a cursed artefact threatens to transform their lives forever. - Meena, a ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work. As Meena vies with an upstart colleague for a crucial promotion, something ancient stirs in the basement beneath her workplace. Last Stop is fully voice acted, featuring hours of dialogue and a voice cast of dozens, with performances from some of the brightest talent in the UK today, including rising stars Lulu Simpson as Molly Smith and Kassian Akhtar as Dylan Hughes.

In result, you can now either give up, ask for mercy and then quietly die, as \u201cmercy\u201d is not a word easily found in Dark Gods\u2019 vocabulary. Or you could release all your godlike powers instead and make the Gods pay for their betrayal. Be sure though, that they\u2019re not willing to go without a fight and they\u2019ll throw at you all kinds of seemingly hilarious pixel art opponents. Don't be fooled by their funny looks however as rest assured, they\u2019ll use any means necessary including their special skill sets to take you down. With the aid of giant bosses they will bring your skills to the test. Slay or get slain. There\u2019s no other way. In Warlocks 2: God Slayers you\u2019ll find: ● Hilarious pixel art with hand-drawn animations; ● Dynamic hack'n\u2019slash experience in solo and local co-op; ● More than 40 types of challenging enemies that work together to take you down, using their unique skill sets; ● Extensive maps with tons of randomly generated loot to be picked up; ● 5 different types of Warlocks to pick up from, each with their own abilities to unlock throughout the game; ● 8-10 hours of gameplay to complete the adventure with one\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Warlocks2GodSlayers_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/warlocks-2-god-slayers-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTiyBNYnrg","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"89%","genre":"Adventure,Action,Role-Playing,Multiplayer","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.70","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Warlocks2GodSlayers.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"30","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/36524/warlocks-2-god-slayers-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Warlocks 2: God Slayers","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"QubicGames","ReleaseDate":"2019-06-07","Slug":"warlocks-2-god-slayers-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"7.50","ChilePrice":"","Price":"17.99","MexicoPrice":"38","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"6.61","SCORE":"67","SaleEnds":"2022-04-07","LowestPrice":"5.24","SaleStarted":"2022-03-17","description":"The good news is your school is about to explode.

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.

During the planning phase the game presents itself with a simple, 2D interface. It is there that you select the best materials for your bridge and connect the dots to make the most resilient structure you can. You can approach each level as a complex puzzle, trying to be as efficient as possible and get the best solution. But don't be afraid to experiment too.

But to achieve that, you must do much more than just push the button! There is a current generator on each of the boards, linked to the fan through a path. Problem is, the path is broken in several places! To ensure that the current reaches the fan uninterrupted, you must create an electric arc wherever the circuit was damaged. Seems complicated? Don't worry. No electrical know-how is required! You just need to skillfully operate a metal ball and build electric arcs with it where needed. It's quite simple and intuitive.

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8Vlv9L9VM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"81","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/110363/rogue-bit-switch","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"19","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"29.99","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"6.49","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-07","LowestPrice":"4.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-17","description":"Rodents! - Mouse - Scout - Capybara - Knight - Porcupine - Barbarian - Beaver - Wizard - Rat - Necromancer - Weasel - Swashbuckler - Every rodent has unique skills which get stronger as you use them - Every rodent hero has a unique back story - Every rodent hero has a unique list of challenges that limit their power Progression! - Power progression mechanic based on reincarnation - Every time a hero is defeated, subsequent heroes will be given power bonuses - By overcoming challenges all future heroes have an even greater potential to be more powerful Quests! - Seven quest zones - Forest - Desert - Jungle - Snow - Jungle - Mountain - Grassland - Parallax scrolling environments - Interactive dialogues with different Quests available depending on your progress - Take place inside of a maze - Mini map - Fog of war - Dynamic lighting with day / night cycle Enemies! - 50+ Enemies, including bosses - Each enemy has unique stats based on their classification - Tanky (Bonus health) - Vicious (Bonus damage) - Speedster (Bonus move speed) - Hyper (Bonus attack speed) - Hardened (Bonus defense) - Accurate (Bonus attack accuracy) - Have different abilities - Charge - Runs towards the Hero and does damage on impact - Ranged Attack - Fires projectiles - Ranged Bomber - Lobs projectiles that do damage on impact - Change Sides - Change from left side of Hero to right side or vice versa - Protector - Takes less damage and blocks projectiles\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RodentWarriors_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rodent-warriors-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Adventure,Action,Fighting,Role-Playing","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7.50","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RodentWarriors.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"90","BrazilPrice":"24.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Rodent Warriors","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"JanduSoft","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-18","Slug":"rodent-warriors-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"20","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"110","SalePrice":"4.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-04","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-14","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia. Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds. Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay.

Well, actually the Holy Grail is the treasure hunters' Holy Grail, but the WHATSIT comes right after it. And even Moorhuhn, the greatest adventurer among treasure hunters, cannot resist a hint as to the whereabouts of this relic.

In the depths of the dense jungle, the Moorhuhn follows the legend of an ancient, lost temple complex. Legendary treasures are said to lie hidden there, but above all a priceless treasure: the sacred amulet of WHATSIT!

With each level completed, the difficulty of fighting with enemies increases. SINGLE SPAWN SPOT The progress saves automatically. Everytime you die, you reappear in one single spawn spot. But any power-ups, abilities, or shortcuts you've unlocked will remain.

And if things get too tough then up to four local friends can grab controllers and aid the hero as player-controlled monsters, zombies, and bandits. The World Large, procedurally generated and interconnected lands range from plains, to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area\u2019s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items.

Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians.

The fate of the girls' lives will change dramatically depending on your actions in the game. Online streamers Mio Ikoma, Nana Sakurai and Azusa Shiraishi travel to the locally famous haunted resort, the Hotel Izanami, at Nana's request to shoot a video there. It would be a film shoot at an average haunted location with no particular legend attached. To finish shooting without a hitch and get an end result that was vaguely horror-esque...was all they wanted. During filming, Mio gets separated from the group, and suddenly gets attacked by a mascot costume that has come to life. From that point on, the trapped girls are at the mercy of numerous horrors throughout the hotel. Why is a mascot trying to harm them, and why have they been shut in to the hotel with no escape? Can the three girls escape from the hotel with their lives? A livestream set in an abandoned hotel begins... ■Run from the mysterious mascot chasing you, and escape from the abandoned hotel!

As Izzy Buspec, the newest recruit to Randco, take charge of their patented revolver as you explore the densely packed biomes of Corvynnia, bringing down hordes of docile robots in a money-making adventure. Every time you fire, you'll have to answer one of over 2,000 trivia questions with answers based on numbers, percentages, geography, dates, and more - the further you are from the actual answer, the more of its own ammunition the revolver will discharge. If you run out, it's back to Randco HQ to reload! Revolver and Co features 105 story levels across 7 unique worlds and 12 question themes which will test you on a wide range of subjects, tied together with humorous debriefings between Izzy and her maniacal boss before the start of each mission. Or if you're looking for more of a challenge, have a go at one of the Endless challenges, which pits you against a barrage of questions until you finally succumb to an empty revolver chamber.

The one next to her appears to be her boyfriend, and after doing their shopping, the two of them link arms affectionately and take off. Just when the young man is thinking how nice it would be to have a girlfriend, a pair of girls in ninja cosplay show up. The girls just stare at the shop goods without buying anything in particular.

On a late-night highway drive, a quiet train car in the early hours, a walk through a moonlight park, or the endless wait in a deserted airport, we listen to weird music amid the ambient announcements of delays and question our place in the universe. Inspired by long travel and the stream of consciousness it fosters, Glitchhikers asks you to look inward. Find the answers to your questions and question the answers you receive. Ruminate on life, the universe, our place and purpose in it. Voyage through a freeform narrative experience, converse with the endless inevitability, and explore the cosmic, hopeful world you find yourself in.
