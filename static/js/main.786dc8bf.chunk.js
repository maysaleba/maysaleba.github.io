Welcome to the world of Shift Happens - the only game out there which doesn\'t take a closer look at the body mass index and where players are actually forced to work together (and occasionally stab each other in the back). Experience thrilling adventures in four totally different worlds: \u25cf Explore a freaked out laboratory where Bismo and Plom had their accident! \u25cf Uncover the secrets of the overgrown green forests... \u25cf ... and survive the dry canyons where a deadly wind awaits you\u2026 \u25cf ... just to prepare you for the bitingly cold caves! The twist: Shift Happens is pure fun for solo players, yet its full potential can only be experienced together. Play it with your best friend while hanging around on a couch enjoying a pizza. Together you can solve puzzles and fight over precious coins. Coordination and communication are key to a successful journey. We recommend using gamepads for maximum enjoyability. The game also features a singleplayer mode with different level content. Although the game is primarily meant to be played by two people, you can play the completely different singleplayer levels without another person. The game features all the good things you should expect from a co-op platformer: \u25cf Over 40 levels of handcrafted fun \u25cf Local co-op gameplay \u25cf Extra challenges/rewards in the levels for completionists and explorers \u25cf More than 30 different levels\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_ShiftHappens_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/shift-happens-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdjOSxpsiQo","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"87%","genre":"Platformer,Action,Puzzle,Multiplayer","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"22.5","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_ShiftHappens.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"197","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/3976/shift-happens-switch","RussiaPrice":"1299","Title":"Shift Happens","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Daedalic GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2018-10-10","Slug":"shift-happens-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 2 players","PolandPrice":"60","ChilePrice":"","Price":"14.99","MexicoPrice":"29.08","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"26.39","SCORE":"75","SaleEnds":"2022-02-08","LowestPrice":"19.79","SaleStarted":"2022-01-19","description":"Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes.

The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Renovate and decorate train stations and trains. Detailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements. Build your own station. Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player\'s commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player\'s score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"8.99","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"109","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"539","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"4.79","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-01-25","LowestPrice":"3.99","SaleStarted":"2022-01-17","description":"Follow the Journey of the Little Firefly to seek The Mother deep inside the heart of the unknown forest!

History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.

Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?<br /><br />If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode!<br /><br />Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you\'ve mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play.<br /><br />You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it\'s close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type.<br /><br />The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it.

An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers.<br /><br />Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these \\"flying soldiers\\" can hardly glide a few inches and they don\'t exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it\'s no surprise that, with squads made up of these \\"characters\\", they wouldn\'t be able to get themselves out of the mess they\'re in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance.<br /><br />Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You\'ll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won\'t make it through without your help.<br /><br />It\'s not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain.
