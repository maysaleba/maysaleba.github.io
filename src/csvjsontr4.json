A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered.

Carrying out their orders are THE HORSEMEN, Nephilim (powerful beings spawned from the unnatural union of angels and demons) who have pledged themselves to the Council and been granted immense power.

Yamaoka-san is a legendary Japanese composer best known for his work on the Silent Hill series; Reikowski is a Hollywood Music in Media Awards nominee who worked on such acclaimed horror games as Blair Witch, Layers of Fear, and Observer. Now they join their creative forces for the music and songs of The Medium.","SaleStarted":"2023-10-17","LowestPrice":"/game/78037","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1813/DV0IXPHtc7JRTLoxsKAg0sJh.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4176-PPSA03718_00-5144890209675501","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTAz758Vt88","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":9,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":219.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1813/DV0IXPHtc7JRTLoxsKAg0sJh.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-medium/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","Title":"The Medium","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BLOOBER TEAM S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-02","Slug":"the-medium-ps5-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/8UhlvGDUJs","IsPS5":1,"Price":439,"MainExtra":8,"SalePrice":219.5,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"75","SaleEnds":"2023-11-01","description":"Previous special offer price valid from 13-09-2023 to 27-09-2023 was (£7.49 / \u20ac8.99 / AU $13.47 / BGN 17.45 / CZK 238 / DKK 67 / HUF 3134 / NZ $14.47 / NOK 89.5 / PLN 40.5 / SEK 94.5 / USD $10.24 / ZAR 159.5 / HRK 67.49 / INR 749 / TRY 89.5 / ILS 36) Mundaun is a lovingly hand-penciled horror tale set in a dark, secluded valley of The Alps.

Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","SaleStarted":"2023-10-17","LowestPrice":"/game/87808","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0102-CUSA24163_00-MAKAIRE000000001","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F177-VTSGSM","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":10,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":98.67,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Title":"Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"CE EUROPE LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-31","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-ps4-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/AUSqJ3pRYX","IsPS5":0,"Price":299,"MainExtra":6,"SalePrice":98.67,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2023-11-01","description":"Trouble is brewing at the Hagmore School of Witchcraft, and only freshman witch-in-training Belle MacFae can put things right.

In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming 8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he takes on hordes of zombies let loose upon the world. Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne. Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury. Protect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic's epic story. 1 player 600MB minimum save size DUALSHOCK®4 Vibration Function Remote Play Supported HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Play as Toby, a police detective arriving at a mysterious old mansion. Explore the mansion floor by floor as you seek to unravel the story behind this bizarre place, with each run giving you the opportunity to collect another piece of evidence to be added onto your Evidence Board. The Mansion also hosts a mysterious cast of characters who may help or hinder your progress on each run... Features \u2022 Creepy and Thrilling storyline unfolds (pun intended) as you progress in the game and unlocks different endings depending on your performance \u2022 Game mechanics designed for high replayability \u2022 Perma-death \u2022 The more you fail and start over, the more you learn about the mechanics \u2022 Unique AI for each enemy type - unexpected behaviours - makes enemies creepier and more fearsome \u2022 Logical puzzles are designed to make the player think \u2022 Collectible Upgrades \u2022 Customize your equipment before each run to shape your own play style Run by run, Paper Cut Mansion will offer you the opportunity of defining your playstyle as you unlock new abilities and discover new equipment that will give you a better chance of overcoming the challenges each procedurally generated run throws at you. Each new item offers further customisation to your ultimate build, allowing for truly unique set ups. Do you want to get in close as a melee fighter or take shots from afar as a ranged marksman? Set yourself up with a drone who can do the fighting for you or create an engineering build who can lay down traps and turrets as you back enemies into them. Completing quests will also grant you temporary perks, making each run feel fresh as you may not get the same perks to choose from next time! The possibilities are endless and there is no correct way to overcome the ever-shifting procedural rooms of the mansion. The mansion itself also has a dimension-hopping twist. Each floor contains portals that lead you to alternate versions of the same location. Each dimension switches up the aesthetics and gameplay. You always start in the NeoCortex dimension, which plays out like an escape room, filled with challenges, puzzles and surprises. From there, you will receive quests that take you into the Reptilian Complex and the Limbic System Dimensions. In the Reptilian Complex, the mansion takes on a fiery appearance as it is overrun with monsters. The Limbic system sees an icy chill overtake the mansion. You\u2019ll need to move quickly and stay near heat sources as the cold damages you on your search for hidden items or torches to light up. With a variety of enemies, clues, quests, secrets, loot and compelling logic puzzles scattered throughout the mansion, there is always something intriguing to discover on each run. There\u2019s always something for you to keep track of - from kit upgrades, puzzles that need solving or quests to complete. Between each level a musical interlude will reveal more of the twisting story, with decisions you make throughout your run subtly affecting the final outcome - with 27 different possible endings wrapping up the tale. All this, combined with its incredible aesthetics, makes Paper Cut Mansion a roguelite you won\u2019t want to miss.","SaleStarted":"2023-10-17","LowestPrice":"/game/112952","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/0809/Js4dKo2XYj1sdyw8t1hJhAcm.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5360-PPSA09516_00-PAPERCUTMANPS5EU","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":143.6,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/0809/Js4dKo2XYj1sdyw8t1hJhAcm.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Paper Cut Mansion","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Thunderful Publishing AB","ReleaseDate":"2022-12-05","Slug":"paper-cut-mansion-ps4&ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":359,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":143.6,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-11-01","description":"In this narrative-driven, third-person survival horror game set 300 years in the future, the player will take on the role of Jacob Lee \u2013 a victim of fate thrown into Black Iron Prison, a maximum-security penitentiary located on Jupiter's moon, Callisto.

Based on the cult role-playing game and developed by specialists in the genre, Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Swansong is a narrative RPG in which your every choice determines the fate of the three main characters and of the Boston Camarilla. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF DARKNESS What if vampires were real? What if these bloodthirsty predators lived hidden among us in complex societies and had been hatching conspiracies for thousands of years? And what if you became one of them? In Vampire: The Masquerade, you play as these alluring monsters in a sophisticated world where the lines between the real and supernatural are always blurred. A HEART-POUNDING THRILLER Hazel Iversen, the Swan, is the new Prince of the Boston Camarilla. An iron hand in a velvet glove, she intends to assert her power and respect the Masquerade, the vampiric law designed to ensure humans never learn of the existence of these creatures of the night. But nothing works as planned. With rumours of plots, murders and power struggles, you must work in the shadows to protect your Sect in a pulsating investigation that plunges Boston into chaos. PLAY AS 3 ORIGINAL VAMPIRES Play as 3 vampires who are over a hundred years old. Progress in the game through their intertwined destinies, deal with their different points of view and use their character sheets to try to separate the truth from the lies. Each character has their own vampiric abilities and disciplines that you can upgrade individually to suit your preferred approach. Will you choose intimidation, seduction or stealth? It's your decision, as long as you can sate your Hunger for blood. GAMEPLAY WITH CONSEQUENCES With its unique gameplay, Swansong puts emphasis on the consequences of your actions in both the investigation and your social interactions with other characters. Analyse each situation carefully because your decisions can have huge consequences on your heroes' lives and the fate of the Boston Camarilla.","SaleStarted":"2023-10-17","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-CUSA33241_00-VTMS000000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7L7M0R8fzA","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":999999,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2022-05-19","Slug":"vampire-the-masquerade--swansong-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":1099,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":329.7,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-11-01","description":"Trapped inside the room full of screens is a pair of hands that can predict the future.

DAY\u2019S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT\u2019S FOR THE DEAD Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems\u2026 fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it\u2019s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let\u2019s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there.","SaleStarted":"2023-10-17","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/2908/HSg5GbvwYMeUj770IcWrHmsi.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-ULTIMATEEDITIOEU","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":496.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/2908/HSg5GbvwYMeUj770IcWrHmsi.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Dying Light 2 Stay Human \u2013 Ultimate Edition PS5","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TECHLAND SP.

DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets.

Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating.
