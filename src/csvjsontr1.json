KEY FEATURES Feel the sound: Play over 40 skins with electronic atmospheres from chill to upbeat. Shuffle skins (like a music playlist) as more are unlocked in a new Shuffle mode. Feel the challenge: Faster tempos means less time to make combos, but slower songs can mean uncleared stacks. You\u2019ll get hooked. Feel the fun: Take the challenge to unlock all skins and avatars, play against friends in local VS 2-player mode, or climb the ranks to the top of the online leaderboards.","SaleStarted":"2023-04-25","LowestPrice":"/game/57975","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/EP0748/CUSA11647_00/izdWhKwBGScHwmpklKmTiwZQfX69Z7yM.png?w=200","MainStory":5,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0748-CUSA11647_00-LUMINESREMASTERE","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_yDEZEaIU8","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":23,"genre":"Casual, Family, Puzzle","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/cdn/EP0748/CUSA11647_00/izdWhKwBGScHwmpklKmTiwZQfX69Z7yM.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/lumines-remastered","Title":"LUMINES REMASTERED","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"ENHANCE GAMES, INC.","ReleaseDate":"2018-07-09","Slug":"lumines-remastered-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/9zRuLHKwW8","IsPS5":0,"Price":144,"MainExtra":16,"SalePrice":57.6,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"80","SaleEnds":"2023-05-10","description":"Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma features diabolic new puzzles and fully animated story sections that push the boundaries of interactive storytelling!
