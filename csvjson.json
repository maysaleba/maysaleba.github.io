The high difficulty level is the base: Timothy is basically defenceless and dies with a single touch from enemies or traps. The world is full of ruins, graveyards and tombstones, caves, swamps and weird characters: every place is made to look wild, abandoned and dangerous. Except for Timothy's grandfather, most characters are often mean or clearly driven by not-so-nice feelings.","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"QubicGames","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-22","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/hero","Slug":"timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch","URL":"/games/detail/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/","platform":"Nintendo Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"50%","Price":"7.99","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Fighting,Role-Playing","SalePrice":"3.99","MexPrice":"89"},{"SCORE":"-1","SaleEnds":"2021-10-14","Title":"TAURONOS","LowestPrice":"4.19","SaleStarted":"2021-09-23","description":"Trapped inside an ancient labyrinth, chased by the mythical Minotaur. Will you reach the center? And if so, what will you discover about yourself there, in the dark? There is but one enemy... But it is the unbeatable Minotaur. Only by exploring the maze of the Labyrinth can you hope to discover how to defeat this immortal monster. The great maze has many tools, many rewards, and many secrets just waiting for you to find them. But you can\u2019t waste your precious time, for the Minotaur is getting ever closer. Dark Flavour The game is inspired by the Greek myth of the labyrinth and the fight between Theseus and the Minotaur. The dark theme is visually expressed by retro pixel art, enriched by voice acting and metaphorical storytelling, creating (we hope) a thrilling atmosphere. The Labyrinth The journey has 6 chapters - each with its own specific challenges, patterns, and rewards. A total of 42 stages, 5 skill upgrades - each with 3 levels, 3 hidden upgrades, 2 unique upgrades, secret passages and Easter eggs. Fair Warning This game is not a rogue-like dungeon crawler, but rather an experience which will ultimately give you the answer to the question: dare you know yourself? Of course, you can simply see it as a guilty pleasure arcade game, just take note: permadeath is unforgiving.","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Restless Corp","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-03","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/t/tauronos-switch/hero","Slug":"tauronos-switch","URL":"/games/detail/tauronos-switch/","platform":"Nintendo Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"40%","Price":"6.99","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Simulation,Arcade","SalePrice":"4.19","MexPrice":"81.36"},{"SCORE":"-1","SaleEnds":"2021-10-26","Title":"Super Hero Fight Club: Reloaded","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2021-10-05","description":"Welcome to the marvelous Super Hero Fight Club: - 17 fabulous fighters and their superpowers - Quick tactical combats - Tricky modes, levels and powerups - Up to 4 players rumble - Single player challenges Become the Queen or King of the Fight Club!","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"QubicGames","ReleaseDate":"2018-12-24","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/super-hero-fight-club-reloaded-switch/hero","Slug":"super-hero-fight-club-reloaded-switch","URL":"/games/detail/super-hero-fight-club-reloaded-switch/","platform":"Nintendo Switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PercentOff":"80%","Price":"9.99","genre":"Action,Arcade,Fighting,Party","SalePrice":"1.99","MexPrice":"38"},{"SCORE":"-1","SaleEnds":"2021-10-20","Title":"Steamburg","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2021-10-06","description":"Steamburg is an award-winning puzzle adventure game with story exploration elements and unique gameplay.
