The mission is no longer just discovery, but to survive the journey with those still left alive. Tharsis is built around a unique mix of a board game and video game mechanics.

Problem is, the path is broken in several places! To ensure that the current reaches the fan uninterrupted, you must create an electric arc wherever the circuit was damaged. Seems complicated? Don\'t worry. No electrical know-how is required! You just need to skillfully operate a metal ball and build electric arcs with it where needed. It\'s quite simple and intuitive.

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn\'t required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don\'t worry if you don\'t know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8Vlv9L9VM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"40%","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"81","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/110363/rogue-bit-switch","RussiaPrice":"295","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"19","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"49.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-02-08","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-01-18","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

Eighties of the twentieth century. The golden age of 8-bit video games. We were leaving school, and we were going to spend our precious coins in the arcade machines. One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari\'s Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn\'t pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time.

The old man fell ill and he\'s now fighting for his life. Timothy, who loves his grandfather very much, decides to take a risky journey to the infamous Mysterious Forest. Legends speak of a magic mushroom able to cure any disease that grows into the forest. Timothy bravely begins his journey to find the magic mushroom. The game mixes elements from adventure/exploration games with puzzle and stealth: exploration, reading and keeping a slow pace is the best tactic. The high difficulty level is the base: Timothy is basically defenceless and dies with a single touch from enemies or traps. The world is full of ruins, graveyards and tombstones, caves, swamps and weird characters: every place is made to look wild, abandoned and dangerous. Except for Timothy\'s grandfather, most characters are often mean or clearly driven by not-so-nice feelings.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TimothyAndTheyMysteriousForest_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Fighting,Role-Playing","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"11.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TimothyAndTheyMysteriousForest.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"139","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"599","Title":"Timothy and the Mysterious Forest","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"QubicGames","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-22","Slug":"timothy-and-the-mysterious-forest-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"32","ChilePrice":"","Price":"7.99","MexicoPrice":"89","SalePrice":"3.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.77","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-02-22","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-02-01","description":"One fine day a bunch of scientists created four tiny monsters.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.

As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality.

Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5\'s hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\'s unique artistic vision to life like never before.

DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\'ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal.

Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of.<br /><br />Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him.

His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night.<br /><br />Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness.

There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster.<br /><br />STORY MODE<br /><br />The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episodes 1+2 were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc.<br /><br />EPISODE ONE - \u201cDO NOT GO GENTLE\u201d<br /><br />Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse.<br /><br />EPISODE TWO - \u201cLUMINACE FUGUE\u201d<br /><br />Mackenzie\'s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted?<br /><br />EPISODE THREE - \\"CROSSROADS ELEGY\\"<br /><br />In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that\'s taking them to Perseverance Mills?<br /><br />EPISODE FOUR - \\"FURY, THEN SILENCE\\"<br /><br />A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation?<br /><br />The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released.<br /><br />SURVIVAL MODE<br /><br />Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access.<br /><br />Survival is your only goal, and death your only end.

[Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath.<br /><br />CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE<br /><br />Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week.

You have 25 seconds to execute your action, be it blasting an enemy, manoeuvring your operative, or setting up your next move. After all players have taken turns, the next 25-second round begins. Now you\'ll face what has happened while setting up what will happen. Each of the five rounds is your chance to alter the timeline as past, present, and future converge.<br /><br />A TIME-BENDING TACTICAL SHOOTER<br />With a varied cast of characters to choose from, how you play is up to you. Lay damaging toxic waste in your enemy\'s path, slow time to land the perfect shot, or deploy protective orbs to assist your future self. Every operative possesses a distinctive loadout and special ability that proves decisive on the battlefield.<br /><br />TEAM UP WITH YOURSELF<br />Welcome to the team comprised entirely of one: you. With Lemnis Gate\'s innovative auto co-op feature, you command every member of your side. Auto co-op gives you total control of five deep-space operatives, effectively enabling two competitors to duke it out in bustling ten-character matches. Become a literal one-person army.<br /><br />COUNTLESS POSSIBILITIES, ENDLESS OUTCOMES<br />From the first second to the last, anything can happen in Lemnis Gate. Each round is a fresh chance to implement an unbeatable new strategy \u2013 or earn redemption from an earlier error.

Experiment both in and outside time, and get creative with causality.<br /><br />A HOST OF MODES AND MATCHTYPES<br />Create a match to your preference. Pick between a 1v1 and 2v2 contest, online or offline. Select your mode amongst three thrilling spins on established genre staples. There\'s Retrieve XM, in which you scramble to collect exotic matter and return it to your gate; Domination, which is about competing to capture zones; and Seek & Destroy, where you attempt to wreck your opponent\'s Resistors. Whether teaming up with a friend for \\"hotseat\\" local multiplayer, or pitting your operatives against online rivals, Lemnis Gate lets you set the board to suit your style.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Frontier Developments PLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-08-03","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/2109/3mpvKaCSJ51XRErifM2jD1ou.png?w=200","Slug":"lemnis-gate-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2514-PPSA02803_00-LEMNISGATE000000","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67CpGkrChFw","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"PercentOff":"40%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Strategy,Multiplayer,First-Person","SalePrice":11.99,"PlusPrice":9.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-02-17 07:59:00","Title":"Let\'s Sing 2021","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-02-02 09:10:39","description":"Let the music take control and become the star of your party or sing your heart out solo!

Getting all games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT\'s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem.

Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world. You can be truly free.<br /><br />SUPERHOT<br /><br />Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It\'s just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.<br /><br />SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE<br /><br />Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT\'s signature power fantasy.<br /><br />You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they\'re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched.<br /><br />Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air.
