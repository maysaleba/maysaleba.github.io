Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community. Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \\"interludes\\", which were originally published separately, available now on Nintendo Switch\u2122 for the first time. Also for the first time, it has been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_KentuckyRouteZeroTvEdition_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0_n9QPves4","PeruPrice":"40","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Adventure,Indie","ArgentinaPrice":"1199.99","AustraliaPrice":"19.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_KentuckyRouteZeroTvEdition.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"40000","SouthafricaPrice":"209.95","BrazilPrice":"59.99","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Annapurna Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2020-01-28","Slug":"kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"49.99","ChilePrice":"8000","Price":"24.99","MexicoPrice":"279.99","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"14.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"11.99","SCORE":"86","SaleEnds":"2022-06-08","LowestPrice":"8.99","SaleStarted":"2022-05-24","description":"Originally created by legendary game designer Sid Meier, Civilization is a turn-based strategy game in which you attempt to build an empire to stand the test of time.

In each of the campaigns for Great Britain, USSR, and Germany, gamers will be able to test their flying skills during deadly encounters with enemy fighters: protecting ground structures from bombers, fighting over the sea to weaken enemy navy, or piloting bombers to destroy strategic targets. Players with a tactical approach will also be able to build a base \u2013 by constructing additional hangars and supporting structures and then ensuring their safety by building anti-aircraft artillery and barrage balloons. There\u2019s all this, plus over 30 historical airplanes at their disposal: from classic fighters to light and heavy bombers which they can fly, repaint, customize, and upgrade. Included in the collection are the Spitfire, Hurricane, Lancaster, II-2 \u201cShturmovik\u201d, La-5FN, Ju-87 \u201cStuka\u201d, Fw 200 \u201cCondor\u201d, and a Nintendo Switch\u2122 exclusive \u2013 the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk. Warplanes: WW2 Dogfight offers easy-to-learn gameplay with intuitive controls and user-friendly flight mechanics.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself!

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player\'s score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"8.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"109","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.65","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-27","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-05-06","description":"Are you ready for the 250 Sit-Ups Challenge?

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia. Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds. Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay. While some levels can be solved in minutes, other may take hours\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_PureMahjong_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pure-mahjong-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":"","genre":"Puzzle,Strategy,Education,Board Game","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.98","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_PureMahjong.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"32.45","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Pure Mahjong","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"the binary family","ReleaseDate":"2019-07-04","Slug":"pure-mahjong-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"7.96","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"38.60","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"27.99","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-06-07","LowestPrice":"20.99","SaleStarted":"2022-05-17","description":"Adopt a new companion!

In the depths of the dense jungle, the Moorhuhn follows the legend of an ancient, lost temple complex. Legendary treasures are said to lie hidden there, but above all a priceless treasure: the sacred amulet of WHATSIT!

Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay You need to conquer a big portion of the initial area that you start the level. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield empties. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and required conquered area percentage for the victory. What happens when you pass a level? You see the related girl\'s photo and can continue with her story or unlock the next girl. How many girls and bosses? 8 girls, 24 bosses, 24 minions, 24 levels, 8 mega levels, 4 traps, 4 power-ups, and 2 towers! Evil towers of course. Each boss and his minions were uniquely designed.

Ashley\'s Mecha-suit, which she calls \\"Mr. Riggs\\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat.

But most importantly, it\'s about understanding your cat.<br /><br />In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it\'s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system.<br /><br />This game fits best for...<br />- People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work<br />- Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids<br />- Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding<br />- Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about \u2018wasting their time\' (although we believe you shouldn\'t feel guilty at all while playing games!)<br />- Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun<br />- Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it<br />- People who like smart cats<br /><br />Learn how machine learning works in real life!<br /><br />The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future.

That means you\'ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That\'s what real data scientists do!<br /><br />Coding just got real!<br /><br />Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it\'s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market!

The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle.<br /><br />The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium.<br /><br />The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with.<br /><br />Battle your way across no man\'s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn\'t for the faint hearted!<br /><br />Looking for more WW1 action? Check out Tannenberg for Eastern Front maneuver warfare, or the upcoming Isonzo for Italian mountain warfare!","ESRBRating":"ESRB Mature 17+","Publisher":"M2H","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-15","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202012/0822/DTzPcBOwcSWWl5HrVa1d8jYE.png?w=200","Slug":"verdun-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1676-PPSA02759_00-2386332613796784","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XboXaVzjoe4","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"PercentOff":"65%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Action,First-Person","SalePrice":6.99,"PlusPrice":6.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"58","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/95068/space-hulk-deathwing--enhanced-edition-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-06-09 06:59:00","Title":"Space Hulk: Deathwing - Enhanced Edition","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-25 08:12:52","description":"Space Hulk: Deathwing - Enhanced Edition is the First-Person Shooter set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe.

As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.<br /><br />Features:<br />\u2022 Survive the horror using adventure mechanics and exploration.<br />\u2022 Experience a beautiful, erotic hand-painted art style with Eastern and Western influences.<br />\u2022 Unlock additional outfits, some of which alter interactions throughout the game.<br />\u2022 Keep track of the immersive lore with a convenient journal feature.<br />\u2022 Discover multiple New Game+ modes, alternate endings and hidden extras!<br />\u2022 Get in the mood with a visceral cinema-length soundtrack.<br /><br />PS Vita: One time license fee entitles play on up to 3 PlayStation Vita systems activated by this account.","ESRBRating":"ESRB Mature","Publisher":"TOP HAT STUDIOS, INC.","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-11","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/0500/yXWVXhy5o38UeU8V01aiQGKb.png?w=200","Slug":"sense--a-cyberpunk-ghost-story-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5155-CUSA19359_00-SENSEACPGS000001","platform":"Playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"50%","Price":19.99,"genre":"","SalePrice":9.99,"PlusPrice":7.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/112926/shadow-legend-vr-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-06-09 06:59:00","Title":"Shadow Legend VR","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-25 08:12:04","description":"Shadow Legend is a single player action-adventure game built exclusively for virtual reality that immerses you in the medieval realm of Anaria.

Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island.<br /><br />Nature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Merge Games Limited","ReleaseDate":"2019-07-30","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307q3DKnRbVRguZntUwA90V0Xpj_BaD9RmoQURl7fcykl0UpKC_E1_YhD3KvFezWNEO-4Q1VmsAp3I200JL3BlTWEUW2Hc.png?w=200","Slug":"solo-islands-of-the-heart-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1260-CUSA14666_00-SOLO000000000001","platform":"Playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"75%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Role-Playing,Platformer,Adventure","SalePrice":4.99,"PlusPrice":3.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-06-09 06:59:00","Title":"Songbringer Bundle","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-25 08:12:54","description":"Contents: Songbringer and Songbringer: Trial of Ren DLC<br /><br />Songbringer is a sci-fi action RPG with swords, secrets, dungeons, bosses and stuff.<br /><br />You play the role of protagonist and accidental hero, Roq Epimetheos.

The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into 15 maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life.<br /><br />Choose how hard you want to work.<br />The level of difficulty depends on the player\'s commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage.<br /><br />Quick and easy access to equipment is the key to success.<br />There are many tools and options for repairing and decorating the station. Work with basic items such as paint rollers, spray cans, crowbars and repair wrenches or use your in-game tablet to order new materials and items. Some stations will even allow you to repair and renovate the old trains. This means you will be able to take care of the technical condition of those vehicles yourself.<br /><br />Specializations development tree<br />An aesthetic development character tree t is available.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5\'s hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\'s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON\'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\'ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\'ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You\'ll experience DEATHLOOP\'s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\'ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\'re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\'s stylish sneakers and invade another player\'s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON    <br />Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","ESRBRating":"ESRB Mature 17+","Publisher":"Bethesda Softworks","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-14","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1617/Fv4asO4zbdqL83hiL9COTlWZ.png?w=200","Slug":"deathloop-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA01302_00-DEATHLOOP0000000","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXv5IDp8y74","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"PercentOff":"60%","Price":59.99,"genre":"Action,First-Person","SalePrice":23.99,"PlusPrice":23.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"87","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/172822/atelier-sophie-2-the-alchemist-of-the-mysterious-dream-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-06-09 06:59:00","Title":"Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-25 08:10:12","description":"A mysterious story of a mysterious dream \u2026<br /><br />This is a story about one of the adventures Sophie the Alchemist had after she left her hometown of Kirchen Bell.

Try to outsmart and outwit all the horrifying creatures you\'ll be facing, as they are way stronger and you don\'t stand a chance in a direct assault;<br />\u25aa Diverse, challenging opponents.

The universe shaped by struggle, where mankind has not had the freedom to develop or advance any of its technology.<br /><br />Manage your scarce resources, venture out with your fellow companions and explore the remnants of the world in search of the means for mankind\'s survival.<br /><br />Monsters can detect a hunter\'s presence by their scent, they can then use this to track down where the hunters are. Observe the wind - keeping yourself downwind of your adversaries will aid you in your hunt. Although, hunters can use their scent to their advantage by preparing an ambush using traps, then luring the monsters towards it.<br /><br />Monsters are not the only threat the hunters will face on their hunts - the presence of the old god is growing ever stronger, changing everything it touches. The darkness can summon more enemies against the hunters, or even change them into an avatar of its will.<br /><br />Hunters can equip different weapons, heavy, more powerful ones that will drain their stamina when used.<br />And smaller ones, better for stealth actions.<br /><br />Within their camp, our hunters can craft new items or get some rest.<br />In addition, we can assign roles to hunters there, e.g. to make one of them guard the camp and protect it from ambushes, or to give them the role of a scavenger, who will collect resources in the region of the camp.<br /><br />Remember, this is not the world you know.<br />This is a world that has been shaped by struggle, one where mankind has not had the freedom to develop and advance its technology.<br /><br />Your resources will be limited, and opportunities rare.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"No Gravity Games S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2022-04-28","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202204/0811/3xDrQnV0UuO525rinrdlIOBH.png?w=200","Slug":"alders-blood-definitive-edition-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6673-CUSA30730_00-0957437476024690","platform":"Playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"20%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Role-Playing,Strategy","SalePrice":15.99,"PlusPrice":15.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-06-09 06:59:00","Title":"Alien Shooter + Doodle God Bundle","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-25 08:13:12","description":"Doodle God<br />Mix different elements to create your own universe in Doodle God!<br />Alien Shooter<br />Sinister hordes of bloodthirsty aliens have infiltrated our world!

Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it\'s heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.<br /><br />During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands.<br /><br />If you\'re lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.<br /><br />You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode.<br /><br />Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you\'re wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal.

Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system.<br /><br />COMMANDERS<br /><br />A set of unique Commanders \u2013 split between Generals, Pilots and Captains \u2013 is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player\'s priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor.<br /><br />SUPPLY SYSTEM<br /><br />In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory.<br />THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED<br />The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941.<br />On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War.<br /><br />In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg.

Created in close cooperation with the creative teams behind the films, John Wick Hex is fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game, capturing the series\' signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe. Players must make quick decisions and choose every action and attack they make, all the while considering their immediate cost and consequences.<br /><br />Featuring a unique blend of strategic time-based action, John Wick Hex captures the feel of the tactical combat from the films and blurs the line between the strategy and action video game genres. Perform well and progress in the main story mode to unlock new weapons, suit options and locations. Each weapon changes up the tactics you\'ll use and the manner in which you\'ll play. Ammo is finite and realistically simulated, so time your reloads and make the most of weapons you scavenge on the job.<br /><br />Experience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game\'s eponymous villain \'Hex\'. John Wick Hex compliments the style of the films with a unique graphic noir art design and an original score by renowned composer Austin Wintory.","ESRBRating":"ESRB Mature","Publisher":"Gambitious","ReleaseDate":"2020-05-05","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202012/1015/YHfqFdzstoCFuS4136RvMdUO.png?w=200","Slug":"john-wick-hex-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1050-CUSA18381_00-JOHNWICKHPS4SIEA","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nEwjqisgGY","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"60%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Strategy","SalePrice":7.99,"PlusPrice":7.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"72","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/70833/knowledge-is-power-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-06-09 06:59:00","Title":"Knowledge is Power","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-25 08:13:06","description":"Answer a massive variety of trivia questions to outsmart your opponents, with tactile challenges thrown in to keep you on your toes.

Players who wander off on their own will have difficulty surviving the elements, can fall victim to hostile wildlife, or become easy targets for the traitors.<br /><br />Communication<br />There are several ways to communicate with other players, including proximity-based voice chat, private voice chat radio channels, text chat, and emotes - communication is key if the survivors have any hope of completing their tasks and defending against the traitors.<br /><br />Betrayal & Deception<br />The traitors are outnumbered and weak when the game begins, they may infiltrate the survivors and earn their trust while they build up their strength. Survivors can never be 100% sure of who to trust. The traitors can take advantage of this by spreading lies, and pitting the survivors against each other.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"OTHER OCEAN INTERACTIVE","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-16","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202008/2601/SbvpnkqP591kc3We2Ky7mPhV.png?w=200","Slug":"project-winter-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0499-CUSA17588_00-PROJECTWINTERPS4","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgBKpFjtvZQ","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"25%","Price":19.99,"genre":"","SalePrice":14.99,"PlusPrice":14.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"70","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/32396/quest-hunter-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-06-09 06:59:00","Title":"Quest Hunter","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-05-25 08:11:39","description":"Quest Hunter is an isometric action-RPG where your choice drives the story.

Sell your soul to The Devil, smash up hotels and become Infamous. Pressure from hotel staff and your own limp wrists are against you, but with over 36 weapons, and a World Tour ahead of you, it\'s time to get creative.<br /><br />Each hotel is a playground of physics-based demolition, with time to explore and plan your strategy before lighting the fireworks and trying to keep the Manager out. With a hellish pawn shop of weirdly satisfying weapons \u2013 including Wet Fish, Cattle Prods, C4 and Guns \u2013 and a stack of Challenges to appease The Devil, becoming the most Infamous takes brains as well as looks.<br /><br />Get the band together for Party Setlists (Pass and Play) or try out ideas at your own pace in Sandbox mode. Hotel R\'n\'R is a satirical journey of selling your soul and then trying to take it back along the way there\'s no shortage of luxury hotels, sarcastic maids and ragdoll physics mayhem.

The rules are simple - push a block in any direction, and it\'ll keep going until it hits a wall or another block.

Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage!<br /><br />Enter the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it\'s said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart\'s true desire.<br /><br />Eons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia. Each of them has their own wish, and their own story to tell.<br /><br />Challenge the Story Mode to take your chosen character through their tale, challenging all the others in fierce puzzle battles to assemble all seven Sacred Blossoms!
