Made by The Chinese Room – the studio responsible for the hauntingly beautiful Dear Esther – this tale of how people respond in the face of grave adversity is a non-linear, open-world experience that pushes innovative interactive storytelling to the next level.<br /><br />Over the course of the game, the player slowly pieces together the fate of the valley from the fragmentary memories of the people who made it their home. By finding and interacting with the traces of these lost lives, the player gradually learns about the stories and relationships of the inhabitants – how they lived, and how they died. All this is accomplished through revolutionary environmental storytelling – what you see and hear in Rapture is just as important as what you do.<br /><br />PS4 game can be controlled via PS Vita<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.<br /><br />• Bold New Beginning — His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. <br />• A Second Chance — Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.<br />• A Darker, More Elemental World — From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War's breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise.<br />• Vicious, Physical Combat — With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

With an emphasis on culture and character, ANOTHER SIGHT focuses on the emotional development of the relationship between its two protagonists, Kit, a refreshingly intrepid teenager, and Hodge – a mysterious red-furred cat. They meet in the darkness of a London Underground construction site, after Kit loses her sight when the tunnel she had been exploring collapses. They team up for an adventure into the unexpected, with Hodge proving himself to be an indispensable companion, upon whom Kit will come to rely. Kit and Hodge explore a surreal fantasy world, both together and separately, each using their own unique talents to make their way through compelling environments, and to solve intriguing puzzles. Beneath London, in a world inspired by Neil Gaiman's urban fantasy, Neverwhere, Kit and Hodge encounter a hidden society made up of the world's greatest inventors and finest artistic minds, including Claude Monet, Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison and other historical cultural icons.<br /><br />Another Sight Gameplay Features:<br /><br />AN EMOTIVE ADVENTURE – A story about a girl and her cat companion on a journey beyond sight and the real world. A tale of affection and intrigue is woven throughout the adventure, touching on trust and companionship, and the consequences of losing what we take for granted. The innovative gameplay and emotional story are galvanized through a soundscape brought to life by a symphonic orchestra, emphasizing the most memorable moments on Kit and Hodge's emotional and physical journey.<br /><br />MASTERS FROM THE PAST - Throughout their journey, Kit and Hodge will meet celebrated virtuosos such as Claude Monet and other historical cultural figures, and learn more about the world and the dangers it presents. These encounters have a visual impact on the world, as Kit's perception alters according to the aesthetics of each famous character's creative movement.<br /><br />NARRATIVE-DRIVEN GAMEPLAY – Use the unique abilities of each character to help Kit and Hodge traverse the world and overcome environmental challenges. Kit and Hodge can split up to investigate different areas of the locale that the other may not be able to reach, with both Kit and Hodge perceiving the world in very different ways, opening up different possibilities for overcoming the obstacles they are faced with on their adventure.<br /><br />Another Sight - © brand names and logos are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of Lunar Great Wall Studios Srl.

See PlayStation.com/bc for more details.<br />※The items offered in this pack can be purchased as a single item.<br /><br />The Oniken + Odallus Collection is a double pack of unmissable old-school action. This bundle contains two 8-bit inspired action games – \"Odallus: The Dark Call\" and \"Oniken\".<br /><br />About Oniken<br /><br />Oniken takes place in a post-apocalyptic future controlled by a sinister corporation, where the ninja mercenary Zaku is the last hope for humanity! Inspired by the demanding gameplay of 8-bit action/platformers, Oniken pits your agility and swordplay against a gauntlet of enemies, traps, and challenging bosses.<br /><br />About Odallus: The Dark Call<br /><br />Odallus: The Dark Call is an exploration and action game, as well as a loving homage to 8-bit genre classics. You will play as Haggis – a battle-weary warrior who must wield his sword once more to rescue his son from Darkness.<br /><br />Borrowing from many elements of the popular Metroid-vania genre, Odallus tasks players to explore the exciting atmosphere created by well-crafted levels, bosses, and enemy types.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

The complex personalities and experiences of more than 20 characters are interwoven across multiple paths and possible endings. Your choices matter, not only to you, but to all those with whom you struggle to connect.<br /><br />Cila, a veteran cop with a sour outlook and anger issues expects nothing more from life besides the smell of ozone, blinding neon lights and the ever-present manhole steam.

Advanced, more efficient and remarkably perceptive, unit M.A.R.A. begins to penetrate Cila's toughened exterior and possibly even heal her new owner's old wounds – if Cila can decipher the recurring nightmare the process brings. Soon Cila and Mara forge a unique, if sometimes uneasy bond.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to Cila, just as her life begins to find its new normal, the technological giant Velta Labs gets wind of Mara's existence and takes a mysterious interest in the android. A war unlike any before is brewing on the horizon, its players are silently being selected and one android's fate may spell the difference between peace, war, the blossoming of a new religion or a technological singularity beyond comprehension.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Journey through a cyberpunk setting of neon-lit corruption.<br />• Explore nearly 100 unique backgrounds and CGs.<br />• Meet 20+ characters with personal histories woven into the narrative.<br />• Experience a vivid soundtrack composed by Andy Andi Han.<br />• Make key choices that impact the story and lead to multiple endings.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Immortal but crippled, your last resort is to take over bodies in order to move, explore… and fight.<br /><br />While you may well be immortal, the corpses you possess are not. Each time your host is destroyed, you will be sent back to the dungeon to find yourself a new one and start again...<br /><br />Experience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs new paths you've unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.<br /><br />Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble make for a visceral and cathartic action game.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Experience mysterious new conflicts, intriguing quests, strange new locations, outlandish weapons, devious characters, and additional ways to aid or defy the Board of Halcyon in two additional narrative expansions for the darkly-humorous, critically-acclaimed, and award-winning sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment and Private Division.<br /><br />•\tThe Outer Worlds: Peril on Gorgon is available now.

Take control of a bundled-up pixel art climber as they make their way across icefields, up frosted peaks, through dark caves and over treacherous pitfalls! Help them survive mysterious hazards and overcome brain-teasing obstacles that span 40 unique levels.<br /><br />The objective is simple, to navigate single-screen challenges from entry to exit, then warp to the next level of escalating complexity.

        "Desc": "Days Gone is an open-world action-adventure game set in a harsh wilderness two years after a devastating global pandemic. Play as Deacon St. John, a drifter and bounty hunter who rides the broken road, fighting to survive while searching for a reason to live. <br />•Harsh Open World: Using the power of PlayStation4 and Unreal Engine 4, Days Gone offers an incredibly realistic and detailed open-world experience. Immerse yourself in vast and hostile environments, and explore their secrets. Search abandoned vehicles, houses, truck stops and towns as you scavenge for resources. But be careful— day and night cycles, along with dynamic weather systems, all affect gameplay and enemy behavior. <br />•Brutal Sandbox Combat: Perfect your gameplay with an endless combination of strategy and play in every situation. Craft customized items using pieces and parts found in the field, from brutal melee weapons to traps and more. Act wisely, as every choice can be the difference between life and death.<br />•Unique Enemies: In addition to human drifters, marauders and militia, Deacon must face a wilderness overrun by Freakers— mindless, feral creatures. Although more animal than human, Freakers are smart and quickly evolving. As with any living creature, they have needs, habits, and behaviors that Deacon must learn and adjust to. <br />•Unique Setting: Adapt to quick environmental changes inspired by the harsh high-desert of the Pacific Northwest. One minute, Deacon is riding through a dense alpine forest—or snow field or lush meadow— and the next, he's fighting his way through harsh desert lava fields and caves. Ancient lava flows scar and define the hazardous environments, delivering a breathtaking and diverse backdrop of regions to explore. From small towns and mountains to cliffs and river basins, explore the beautiful but threatening world, left in the wake of humanity's destruction.<br />•Compelling Story: At its core, Days Gone is about survivors and what makes them human: desperation, loss, madness, betrayal, friendship, brotherhood, regret, love— and hope. It's about how, even when confronted with such enormous tragedy, hope never dies.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

        "Desc": "Going Under is a satirical dungeon crawler about exploring the cursed ruins of failed tech startups. As an unpaid intern in the dystopian city of Neo-Cascadia, you'll wield office junk as weaponry as you make your way through the offbeat procedural dungeons beneath your company campus.<br /><br />[The Future is Wack]<br />Failed businesses no longer just cease to exist--they sink beneath the earth, and their employees are cursed to wander the halls for eternity as monsters. It's your duty to put these monsters out of their misery and repossess their assets--so that your boss can afford a new car, or something.<br /><br />[Not All Heroes Get Paychecks]<br />Battle through the remains of failed startups themed off of gig workers, dating sites, and cryptocurrency. Uncover the true motives of your employer, a carbonated drink startup known as Fizzle, and their parent company, a subscription box manufacturer with an army of helpful shipping drones. Make friends with your co-workers! Hire a freelance goblin! Date a slime! Invest in crypto! Set a rideshare on fire!<br /><br />[Fight Flexibly]<br />In the dungeons of Going Under, almost everything can be used as a weapon, from laptops to brooms to body pillows. Proper weapons can be found as well, but even they can break at a moment's notice if you aren't careful. Playing cautiously and picking the right weapon for the situation are musts if you intend on surviving your internship.<br /><br />[Horrible Bosses]<br />And you thought your boss was a monster. At the bottom of the dungeons lurk the founders of the cursed startups, getting rich off of investments while their employees fight amongst themselves. Defeat them and return to the surface with their enchanted relics to empower the company you work for.<br /><br />[Get Paid in Experience]<br />As you explore, you'll encounter powerful Skills that change the way you play. Learn them at the Cafe and they'll show up in future runs. Use a Skill often enough, and you'll get it “endorsed” and available to start your expeditions with. Combine multiple Skills for crazy synergies, and you'll be cleaning house in no time.<br /><br />[A World of Characters]<br />Complete Tasks for your co-workers to gain Clout with them and unlock their unique bonuses. Learn more about Neo-Cascadia, the origins of Fizzle, and how the drone shipping empire known as Cubicle came to dominate the city. Can you save your company and yourself from going under for good?<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

        "Desc": "In Grow Home you play as BUD (Botanical Utility Droid), a robot on a mission to save his home planet by harvesting the seeds of a giant alien plant. On his quest BUD will discover a beautiful world of floating islands that are home to some rather strange plants and animals.<br />Grow the giant plant and use your unique climbing abilities to reach ever higher ground, but be careful…one wrong move and it's a long way down!<br /><br />Climbing: Procedural animation allows you to move BUDs hands independently, creating a unique and unrestricted climbing experience.<br /><br />Growing: Guide and ride the giant alien plant as you create your own pathways in the sky. Everything you grow can be climbed on. Use it as a bridge, a safety net, or simply as a tool for artistic expression.<br /><br />Exploration: Explore every nook and cranny of the alien world as you hunt and collect crystals that can enhance BUDs abilities. It's a physical playground and many of the alien plants have unusual properties that can help you on your quest.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Play as a hero knight and use your sword to rid the castle of ghouls and undead lurking its dark halls. With intuitive controls and puzzle-like combat, Horned Knight emboldens the player to conquer unique pixel art obstacles with the support of generous checkpoints and an invigorating soundtrack.<br /><br />Agility is key! One small misstep can lead to your demise in 32 pulse-pounding levels, offering various challenges from fireball wielding skeletons to venomous snakes, spike traps, pools of lava and much more!

Overcome gigantic bosses and uncover secrets leading to unknown paths to find more heart pieces. If your health depletes, it's back to the last checkpoint for another chance to prove your worth!<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Adventure through 32 levels across 4 unique worlds!<br />• Take down a daunting variety of enemies that stand in your way.<br />• Survive intense boss battles with challenging patterns and epic scale!<br />• Choose between 2 difficulty modes to focus on story or push your skills to the limit.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Flow mechanics.

For years the Patapon tribe has lived in the desolate frontier, driven from their home by the evil Zigoton army.  Behind the Patapons' cute exterior, lies a fierce warrior spirit that can only be commanded by the beat of their God's war drum.  They wait for the day that the \"Almighty\" will return, to lead them against their enemies and bring them back to their homeland.  Finally, their wait has come to an end as the drums of war are heard once again.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

See PlayStation.com/bc for more details.<br />Pixel Ripped 1989 is a wacky multi-dimensional homage to the early days of gaming. The player embarks on a journey into the screen of a classic videogame and beyond. Set in the era of portable 8-bit consoles, this game-within- a-game follows the adventures of Dot, an in-game character who sees her world torn apart by the Cyblin Lord, a villain able to break through the video game screen and invade the real world. In the game, the player inhabits Nicola, a second-grade student who must help Dot save both realities from this menace by facing challenges in the retrogaming 2D world, all while distracting the cranky teacher and escaping from the furious headmaster in her own 3D world.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

To restore balance to multiple dimensions, our videogame hero Dot recruits the help of the best gamer from 1995, an unassuming 9-year-old boy named David. Join this unlikely duo through challenging throwbacks to all your favorite classics from the late 16-bit and early 32-bit era of games inside a virtual reality world.<br /><br />The game evokes a genuine nostalgic feeling, such as the adrenaline of playing games without getting caught after your mom told you to go to bed, or the thrill of finding that brand new game at the store. You have to do all that and more through multiple environments - including your living room, bedroom, the local video rental store, the arcade at the pier, and more. With 6 fully original and highly differentiated levels, where each one feels like an entire new game, Pixel Ripped 1995 is an incredible journey for both VR and retro gamers.",

Choose your approach when infiltrating mighty castles, snowy mountain monasteries or hidden forest camps. Set traps, poison your opponents or completely avoid enemy contact.<br /><br />The group is composed of very different personalities. Working together as a team seems impossible at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons.<br /><br />The player has to carefully evaluate his options in order to master the challenging missions: how will the characters behave as a team? Which one is best equipped for each task? How can they best master the given missions? Come up with your own ingenious tactics to vanquish enemies and complete missions.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

You can also craft equipment, weapons and armor for yourself and any companions you recruit along the way.<br /><br />Undertake an adventure through forgotten paradises, lost cities under ice, and dystopian shanty towns that sprawl across Mars' dusty embrace.
