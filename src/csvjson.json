Will you reach the center? And if so, what will you discover about yourself there, in the dark? There is but one enemy... But it is the unbeatable Minotaur. Only by exploring the maze of the Labyrinth can you hope to discover how to defeat this immortal monster. The great maze has many tools, many rewards, and many secrets just waiting for you to find them. But you can\u2019t waste your precious time, for the Minotaur is getting ever closer. Dark Flavour The game is inspired by the Greek myth of the labyrinth and the fight between Theseus and the Minotaur.

The Labyrinth The journey has 6 chapters - each with its own specific challenges, patterns, and rewards. A total of 42 stages, 5 skill upgrades - each with 3 levels, 3 hidden upgrades, 2 unique upgrades, secret passages and Easter eggs.

Any one of three random murderers helps to minimize spoilers. ● Choices matter - catch the killer, save the victims, make and break relationships \u2013 or don\u2019t. ● Problem solving - can\u2019t get that vital clue yourself? Try shapeshifting into the Police Chief. Think the dialogue options are a trap?

Bringing back old school difficulty, Spinch will have you replaying sections until you master your timing and reflexes. Dash, dodge, climb, swim, jump, and even shoot your own babies as you take on six enigmatic bosses in six vibrant worlds.

His works contain an affiliation with psychedelia, spirituality, alternate realities, and a blending of nature with technology. James Kirkpatrick, well known for his participation in the early Canadian graffiti movement and as avant-garde hip-hop artist, Thesis Sahib, created the audio landscape of retro soundbites and electronic sounds found within Spinch.

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.

Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay You need to conquer a big portion of the initial area that you start the level. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield empties. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and required conquered area percentage for the victory. What happens when you pass a level? You see the related girl's photo and can continue with her story or unlock the next girl. How many girls and bosses? 8 girls, 24 bosses, 24 minions, 24 levels, 8 mega levels, 4 traps, 4 power-ups, and 2 towers! Evil towers of course. Each boss and his minions were uniquely designed.

Set in the same universe as the first game, but with different characters and a different setting, Outlast 2 is a twisted new journey into the depths of the human mind and its dark secrets. Outlast 2 introduces you to Sullivan Knoth and his followers, who left our wicked world behind to give birth to Temple Gate, a town, deep in the wilderness and hidden from civilization. Knoth and his flock are preparing for the tribulations of the end of times and you\u2019re right in the thick of it. You are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch. You're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe. The investigation has lead you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Outlast2_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/outlast-2-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"7.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Outlast2.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"49.80","BrazilPrice":"19.80","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Outlast 2","ESRBRating":"Mature","Publisher":"Red Barrels","ReleaseDate":"2018-03-27","Slug":"outlast-2-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"29.99","MexicoPrice":"79.80","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"5.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.39","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-05","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-14","description":"Phantaruk combines survival horror with adventure and stealth mechanics.
