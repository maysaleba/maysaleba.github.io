Inspired by the two year struggle for control of the Isonzo river valley and the Alps during World War One, Isonzo elevates the WW1 Games Series, figuratively and literally. Take part in historical offensives from the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo to the Strafexpedition. Reflecting the course of the actual battles, as the attackers advance the fighting will shift through vastly different landscapes within a single offensive: from hillside fortresses to mountain trenches and fierce urban combat on city streets. Everything is recreated based on research and field trips, from sound effects and uniforms down to the houses, vineyards and trenches you\u2019ll be fighting over. The new Offensive game mode puts you right in the middle of key historical offensives on the Italian Front. Lead the charge across stunning Italian landscapes as you choose your path to victory - cut paths through barbed wire, flank your enemies by following mountain trails, or man a mortar to blast a way through. Shape a dynamic battlefield by laying sandbags and wire, placing ammo crates, deploying trench periscopes or sniper shields, and more. Call in support with a unique historically accurate flare system: flare guns can mark targets for artillery or biplane flybys, or different colored flares can be used to guide your team. Once the big guns have softened up the enemy, finish the job at close quarters with an Arditi dagger or mountaineer\u2019s pickaxe. Man heavy machine guns, mortars and even mountain guns for more direct fire support. Choose from six classes based on historical combat roles and build your loadout from a selection of weapons, equipment and perks linked to that class, giving flexibility and variety while staying grounded in what real soldiers might have carried. You\u2019ll be operating wire cutters, bandaging yourself and wounded teammates, and blowing the whistle to start an assault. One shot can kill and even lighter injuries can lead to quickly bleeding out. Being an effective soldier in Isonzo is not just about being a good marksman. Mastering the terrain is also key - the mountain can be a friend or foe. Learn how to navigate well to maintain cover and surprise your enemies or support your allies. Finally\u2026 watch out for the dreaded poison gas. You\u2019ve never experienced WW1 action quite like this! Key features: \u2022 MOUNTAIN WARFARE: Assaulting mountain fortifications, battling through ruined towns, and fording rivers are just a few of the challenges you\u2019ll face as you fight your way through numerous enemy positions \u2022 TACTICAL MULTIPLAYER FPS: Choose your role and loadout carefully to survive this high altitude combat - play a sniper to pick off the enemy engineers before they can cut your wire, use rifle grenades to clear enemy machine guns, and much more \u2022 WORLD WAR ONE GAMEPLAY: Historical Offensive game mode based on real battles and focused on the unique challenges of Alpine warfare. Fight with 30+ WW1 weapons, poisonous gas attacks, and intense artillery barrages \u2022 BUILD FOR VICTORY: Place your own wire, sandbags, trench periscopes, and more! Whether you\u2019re digging in or on the attack, shaping the battlefield to your advantage will be key to victory \u2022 FACES OF WAR: Make every class your own by picking from a variety of historically class-appropriate uniforms, accessories and headgear. As a finishing touch, you can even pick your mustache from several famous period-accurate styles! \u2022 AUTHENTIC WW1 ATMOSPHERE: Accuracy in everything from maps and weaponry to music and the uniforms \u2013 fight for the Kingdom of Italy, the German Empire or the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy","SaleStarted":"2023-05-09","LowestPrice":"/game/100042","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/2211/01fd5206d274782f60402d0094fb4c86a4dcc87e4f08a447.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1662-PPSA03556_00-0215549468794198","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhPPeJi4ehE","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":149,"genre":"Action, Shooter, Strategy","PlusPrice":164.45,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/2211/01fd5206d274782f60402d0094fb4c86a4dcc87e4f08a447.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/isonzo","Title":"Isonzo","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BlackMill Games B.V.","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-20","Slug":"isonzo-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/4V7L7av9dI","IsPS5":1,"Price":299,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":164.45,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"67","SaleEnds":"2023-05-24","description":"A demonic invasion has overwhelmed the Union Aerospace Corporation\u2019s Martian research facility, leaving horror and death in its wake.

Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to. Scale Massive Beasts ------------------------------- Overcome impossible odds to climb atop and defeat the massive beasts that are bound to this land. Climb, Glide, Swim ------------------------------- You can climb on virtually anything you can get your hands on, from ruins and mountains to the massive beasts that inhabit the land. Ascend to the tops of mountains and then glide over the open world to reach previously inaccessible locations. Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don't stay in too long or your swim could become your last. Explore, Craft, and Survive ------------------------------- You'll arrive on a frozen island with only the clothes on your back -- it's up to you to survive. Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn't the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait. Make Your Path ------------------------------- Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course. Unravel the Mystery ------------------------------- Why won't the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to. A Beautifully Frigid World ------------------------------- Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog. The remnants of an ancient civilization lie before you, but don't let awe turn into carelessness -- snow storms can crop up at any moment and bury you in a blizzard. Luckily, you can leave footprints in the snow and follow your footsteps back if you are lost.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-09","LowestPrice":"/game/64731","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1863-PPSA02191_00-0442182297085207","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzDl2THyF4w","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":18,"genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":171,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/praey-for-the-gods","Title":"PRAEY FOR THE GODS","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"No Matter Studios LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-12-14","Slug":"praey-for-the-gods-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/503bjIDSVu","IsPS5":1,"Price":285,"MainExtra":12,"SalePrice":185.25,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"46","SaleEnds":"2023-05-24","description":"Welcome to a feel-good FPS!

If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"Contraptions\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style. Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels. Features + Solve over 200 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds. + Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it. + Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs. + Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like. Gameplay On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. When the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again. Gadgets Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car. Objectives There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc. The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-09","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1611/903ac3051a1c8b056dfb990b0e323721f39ab8674bbbc7c9.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4358-CUSA40925_00-CONTRAPTIONS2EUR","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Puzzle","PlusPrice":17.25,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1611/903ac3051a1c8b056dfb990b0e323721f39ab8674bbbc7c9.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Contraptions 2","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FUNBOX MEDIA LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2023-04-05","Slug":"contraptions-2-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":69,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":20.7,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-24","description":"Looking for an authentic retro experience?

Scaramuccia\u2019s trinity mask intimidates any audience, but the many faces behind the mask are quick to perform the fool, the friend, or the villain. Whichever he senses will put a room at ease, or compel it to serve his will. The three-faced mask always conceals which way he looks, confusing predator and prey alike until his next move. It\u2019s a mask that has only been seen once before: worn by a gifted harlequin, who was the leading act of a renowned three-man troupe. The troupe\u2019s director kept the harlequin caged between shows, spreading rumors of grotesque disfigurement and urging people to join the audience for a glimpse beneath the mask. The third of the troupe was the bard, who drew people in with songs of sorrow and sympathy for the harlequin\u2019s disfigurement, before entrancing that same crowd with accompaniments to the troupe\u2019s one-man shows. Many who came to see the plays clamored for a chance to peek at the harlequin\u2019s face, trying to confirm the irresistibly horrifying descriptions the rumors spoke of. But no such chance came, and none could ever find what lair the troupe held the harlequin in between shows. With the show\u2019s success, the director\u2019s clothing grew more lavish and the bard\u2019s guitar more ornate, yet the harlequin\u2019s single costume tore new holes every day. Poverty only added to both the spectacle and pity for the alleged freak, and a freak show proved to draw a greater paying audience than theatre. Then at the peak of the show\u2019s success, the director, bard, and harlequin all vanished without trace. Some weeks later, two bodies were found in the canal stripped of their clothes and with faces too grotesque to identify. Now, amongst the torment of the Bayou, the troupe\u2019s sole survivor christens himself \u201cScaramuccia\u201d. On the hunt, his finely crafted demeanor shifts and relaxes: relishing not the hunt, but the accursed swamps themselves. Perhaps peeling away the mask would reveal a face less akin to his fellow hunters, and more like what he hunts.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-09","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/3113/Trtpg36s1rJQGThKdZOmPA15.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-THEHUNTGAME00050","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":69.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/3113/Trtpg36s1rJQGThKdZOmPA15.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Hunt: Showdown - Commedia Della Morte","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Crytek Gmbh","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-21","Slug":"hunt-showdown--commedia-della-morte-playstation-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":69.3,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-24","description":"While exploring a mysterious cave in the forest a completely unpredictable accident leaves you trapped underground where you must escape by using you inhuman strength to hurl giant blocks at your enemies and activate abilities conferred by special blocks.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-09","LowestPrice":"/game/106568","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/0714/kkZ5NHc7iTrDhwf7CNhgg88Q.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2919-PPSA13401_00-0128270744981398","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":2,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":1.25,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/0714/kkZ5NHc7iTrDhwf7CNhgg88Q.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Violetti Goottii","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"The Voices Games Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-17","Slug":"violetti-goottii-playstation-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":2.5,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":1.25,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-24","description":"The Gun Upgrade Materials Kit contains consumable items used as materials to upgrade Sakamoto Ryoma's guns.

The great grandpappy of adventure games will test you and tickle your problem-solving skills as you unearth its plot and secrets. Through cunning trial-and-error you will crawl through tight squeezes, encounter impressive caverns, collect inventory, locate treasure, thwart dwarf attacks, all while keeping your eye on the score before your lamp goes out. Dust off your vintage Colossal Cave maps from the 70s or 80s, they'll still work like a charm. This is a faithful, unchanged tribute to the original game design. Developed in the mid-1970\u2019s by amateur cave spelunker, this classic text-adventure was originally crafted as a way for a father to entertain his two young daughters. Will Crowther based his design on detailed cave maps he\u2019d made with his wife, Patricia, of the Bedquilt section of Kentucky\u2019s Mammoth cave. Family cave exploration is at the heart of this game. Shortly thereafter, the code-prankster, Don Woods, discovered the game on the ARPANET and expanded the cave. He layered in more fun, fantasy, puzzles, and a vexing 350-point system. Years later, Don\u2019s expansion became the most accessible and the definitive version of Colossal Cave Adventure. Enter Roberta Williams. She first played the game in 1979 and was instantly hooked. She spent weeks playing the game, taking notes and mapping out the cave, as it was revealed through the textual descriptions in game. Her mind was filled with imaginary neon mushrooms, misty underground lakes, a snappy bivalve mollusk, and a noticeably absent giant. After finishing the game, and all 350 points achieved, she was ready for another adventure \u2013 a dilemma in 1979. If it was another adventure she wanted, she\u2019d have to make her own... and, indeed she did. In 1980 she designed and developed the world\u2019s first graphic computer game, Mystery House. This groundbreaking game is considered one of the most influential in history, establishing conventions that have become standard in the adventure game genre. It has been ported to just about every computer and console, played by millions, and inspired many other games, books, movies, and TV series. Relive the golden age of adventure gaming. Immerse yourself in a timeless exploration through a sprawling cave system filled with treasures, creatures, and brain-teasing puzzles. Transport back to a more innocent time and experience the retro-cool of point-and-click mechanics, accompanied by an art style that harkens back to the golden age of adventure games.

Ken and Roberta Williams are committed to sharing and preserving the spirit of classic adventure games. With its challenging and mind-bending puzzles, this explorative game will keep you enthralled.

Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don\u2019t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can\u2019t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don\u2019t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren\u2019t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it\u2019s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, in most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can\u2019t sell what you don\u2019t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don\u2019t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn\u2019t your cup of tea, we don\u2019t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-09","LowestPrice":"/game/89898","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png?w=200","MainStory":10,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-GASSTATIONSIM0EU","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQQbqDBpm_0","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":26,"genre":"Simulation","PlusPrice":139.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Gas Station Simulator","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"MD GAMES SA","ReleaseDate":"2022-10-19","Slug":"gas-station-simulator-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":199,"MainExtra":13,"SalePrice":149.25,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-24","description":"Take care of sick and injured animals in your own small animal practice.

The Two Point Studios Double Pack features both critically acclaimed games - Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. Also includes Two Point Hospital's first four major DLCs, Bigfoot, Pebberley Reef, Close Encounters and Off the Grid, along with two item packs, Exhibition Items and Retro Items. Two Point Hospital Build, cure and improve! Build up a hospital from nothing to a masterpiece as you design the most beautiful \u2013 or functional \u2013 healthcare operation in the whole of Two Point County. Optimise your hospital design to increase patient (and cash) flow, arranging corridors, rooms and waiting areas to your exact specifications. Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible. Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in. Cure unusual illnesses! Don\u2019t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, you\u2019ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism \u2013 each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine. Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. Once you\u2019ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut. Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next? Two Point Campus Build your university, your way! It\u2019s time to spin academia on its head! Got a yearning for learning? Or just keen to build an educational masterpiece? Two Point Campus is jam-packed with new creative tools to help you build the university of your dreams. For the first time, build on the outside as you develop a blank canvas of greenery into your own delightfully educational campus environment, housing the top teaching facilities in the land. Lay down pathways with new easy-to-use tools. Plant glorious collections of outdoor flora. The only limit is your imagination (and your in-game bank balance). Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies. Build libraries, hire the best staff, kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked! But it\u2019s not just work hard. Oh, no. It\u2019s play hard, too. You\u2019ll need to keep an eye on their happiness and make sure they\u2019re getting enough entertainment, pastoral care and general joie de vivre to develop into incredible individuals who will do the legacy of your university proud.

Whatever happened, she was driven to find order, to find a way to balance the odds. The rabbit hole she followed led deeper and deeper into a shadowy sect of the AHA that sought to keep the world\u2019s unpalatable truths covered. As she passed from success to success, the sect assigned her to straighten out one of their wayward sons, Isaac Powell. Powell, now The Night Seer, impressed Ozols with his vision of a world turned upside down. She grew jealous of his foresight and saw the way to achieve the justice she craved: a way to balance the rightness of actions by both their past and future effects. Ozols gained the Night Seer\u2019s trust, and he confided in her the ritual he had undertaken. She repeated it, and as the power coursed through her, it left her blind to the present, but with a powerful and uncanny sense of what was to come. But seeing the Night Seer\u2019s path, more vividly than he himself had ever managed, shocked Ozols. She shredded her white robes and dyed them black. The symbols of power she\u2019d once daubed in blood, she bleached again with the light from the corrupted moon, enriching her affinity for Dark Sight. She tied the scraps around her weapons, sure reminders to keep her path true. Relying on her heightened perception, familiarity with Dark Sight, and uncanny foresight, Ozols now pursues the Night of the Hunter and any who would work towards their goals. In turn, the Night Seer feels the threat of there being one with greater power than himself, and knows that his prophecy will not come true if another has witnessed it.

Buckle up for an action-packed adventure, as you parkour your way through a rough terrain full of challenges: surf steep slopes, climb high walls, vault over obstacles, swing on vines and jump over deep pits to explore a hand drawn open world. Every corner of the island hides an artifact, a clue or a piece of the puzzle that needs to be solved to save the world from disaster. You are not alone on the island... Marie Taylor is the hero of the story, a brilliant treasure hunter who works with her associate, historian James Andrew, seeking out ancient relics. But this time they'll find out they're not the only ones aware of the Minoan scoop, as longtime rivals appear on scene to bring back ghosts from the past and complicate matters further.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-09","LowestPrice":"/game/106829","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202111/1213/aC0ypYGlcspuzBxr0pxOtmTj.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5938-CUSA28711_00-TREASURES0AEGEAN","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":13,"genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":62.65,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202111/1213/aC0ypYGlcspuzBxr0pxOtmTj.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Treasures of the Aegean","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NUMSKULL GAMES LTD","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-10","Slug":"treasures-of-the-aegean-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":179,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":71.6,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-24","description":"Buy this digital PS5™ version of Call of Duty®: Vanguard from the PlayStation®Store and download the PS4™ version at no extra cost.

However, the \u201coriginal game soundtrack selections\u201d are playable on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. Deluxe Edition Content: \u2022 Unique Weapon: Transtar Trencher (PS5 Exclusive) \u2022 Unique Weapon: Eat The Rich Tribunal \u2022 Unique Weapon: .44 Karat Fourpounder \u2022 Character Skin: \"Party Crasher\" Colt \u2022 Character Skin: \"Sharp Shooter\" Julianna \u2022 Two Trinkets (equippable buffs) \u2022 Original Game Soundtrack Selections (*FORMATTED USB STORAGE DEVICE REQUIRED TO ACCESS AND PLAY SOUNDTRACK) DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-09","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0511/Mf4pgYWJtQWLwUG66xNIWNJG.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1003-PPSA01670_00-DE1CDXDLOOPDELUX","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":210.87,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0511/Mf4pgYWJtQWLwUG66xNIWNJG.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"DEATHLOOP Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Bethesda","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-13","Slug":"deathloop-deluxe-edition-playstation-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":639,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":210.87,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-24","description":"Swamp Defense 2 is a classic tower defense game with unique weapons and monsters as enemies for any beginner or defensive specialists. Fight countless enemies with a huge selection of gun turrets (in the form of comic heroes) and additional helpers (mines, air support, block wall) on more than 60 maps. Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

The Endsieg campaign includes 16 unique scenarios. The story begins right after the Battle of Kursk, where the game provides the option to import a core force from either the Panzerkrieg or Sandstorm campaign. The first five scenarios are based on the historical 1st Soviet offensive in the Donbass in summer 1943, up to the Leningrad\u2013Novgorod strategic offensive in early 1944. A decisive defeat of the Red Army will eventually allow total victory over the Soviet Union, while failure to do so will turn the campaign away from the Eastern Front and into the Battle of Anzio in Italy. In the second part of the campaign the player's forces are transferred to the west, where the Allied invasion of Normandy has opened a new front. Initially you'll be forced on the defensive, and you'll be tasked to extract other German forces from the Falaise trap, defeat Allied airborne units in Market-Garden, and defend the city of Aachen and the Huertgenwald against heavy attacks.

Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders \u2013 split between Generals, Pilots and Captains \u2013 is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow.

Using a simple navigation system you weave your way through the traffic, overtaking the slower cars on the road and shooting anything in your way. You win coins for each car you destroy, the larger cars offering a bigger reward. Some vehicles may also leave behind power-ups to help you along your way. At the end of each level you\u2019ll encounter an end of level boss who\u2019s trying to shoot you off the road. Dodge their bullets and make each of your shots count! Keep playing until your health falls to zero. If you get hit by bullets or hit other cars you will lose car health. Periodically you\u2019ll encounter roadworks - avoid these at all costs! The car\u2019s weapons continuously shoot, so there are no weapons to control - the player\u2019s focus is to weave around other cars collecting the coins and power ups: - Laser: maximum damage to the other vehicles - Nitro: give your car that extra speed boost - Magnet : brings all the coins to you When you\u2019re ready you can take a pit-stop to the shop and use your coins to upgrade your wheels. You can upgrade any of the six upgradable items for your car: - Shield - makes your car last longer - Guns - the better your guns the more damage they do - Side Guns - triple your weapons reach by shooting out the sides of your car too - Magnet - increase the length of time the magnet power-up operates for - Nitro - increase the length of time the nitro power-up operates for - Laser - increase the length of time the laser power-up operates for Progression & Challenge The player can pick from one of three cars; the player begins with only one car unlocked. The second and third cars only become available after a series of challenges have been achieved relating to the level, total distance travelled and number of cars destroyed. Once the challenges have been achieved, the player can use their coins to buy the car. As the player progresses through the levels, the enemy cars become harder and harder to destroy.

Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks. The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds. What\u2019s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\u2019ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production. They don\u2019t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\u2019ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\u2019t happen but marketing text is hard to write.","SaleStarted":"2023-05-09","LowestPrice":"/game/68001","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/1209/bhgDakvgeEnnYx3kinsfd3cw.png?w=200","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1051-CUSA27278_00-SUPERMEATBOYFORE","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKjjyDUgGd8","PercentOff":"90%","Completionist":10,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":18.9,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/1209/bhgDakvgeEnnYx3kinsfd3cw.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Super Meat Boy Forever","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TEAM MEAT LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-19","Slug":"super-meat-boy-forever-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":189,"MainExtra":6,"SalePrice":18.9,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-05-24","description":"It´s all about blasting Monsters.
