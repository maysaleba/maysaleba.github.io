"92","2024-10-09","From PlayStation Studios and Bluepoint Games comes a remake of the PlayStation classic, Demon's Souls. Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who've faced its trials and tribulations before can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance. In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant, channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One. With the summoning of The Old One, a colourless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them lost their minds — left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained. Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title ""Slayer of Demons"" and send The Old One back to its slumber.","2024-09-24","/game/82153","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1717/GemRaOZaCMhGxQ9dRhnQQyT5.png?w=200","23","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP9000-PPSA01341_00-DEMONSSOULS00000","50%","59","Action","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/demons-souls","Demon's Souls","TRD","Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe","2020-11-11","demons-souls-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","619.00","32","309.50","0","6",

The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons.

It tells the story of a young nun who sets off on a journey of self-discovery with the most unusual, horn-headed companion by her side. On the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance—as she speaks with the devil himself. Indika’s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery. The world she discovers can only be described as a wild combination of comedy and tragedy straight out of the novels by Dostoyevski and Bulhakov. ENJOY AN INDIE GAME WHERE EVERYTHING GOES The subjects of religion and authority are prevalent throughout Indika’s journey and she’ll be faced with many questions along the way. Guide her to find the answers one by one before she can finish her life-defining odyssey. Odd Meter is a small, independent studio formerly based in Moscow and now operating out of Kazakhstan. Its members put aesthetics at the forefront and aren’t afraid to tread the fine line of ethical norms. Their game is a great testament to that, as INDIKA constitutes an open challenge to the industry's established approach to creating video games.","2024-09-24","/game/139446","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/1114/2ab11b93f3b922d21a0c77af4baf962952e4e4d4ac775641.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-PPSA16214_00-0000000000INDIKA","30%","5","Adventure","612.5","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/indika","INDIKA","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2024-05-17","indika-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","4","612.50","0","1",

"79","2024-10-09","Inkulinati is an ink-based strategy game straight from medieval manuscripts, where a rabbit’s bum can be deadlier than a dog's sword. Take your turn in Inkulinati duels filled with unexpected tactical depth (and humour!). Embark on an ever-changing journey, build your own bestiary, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash special powers. Become a master of the Living Ink, grab your quill and build your unique strategy time after time so that you can be named the greatest Inkulinati of all time! INKULINATI IS INSPIRED BY REAL-LIFE MEDIEVAL MARGINALIA 700 years in the making, finally these bizarre art pieces can come alive in a video game and show that medieval people also had their “memes” and that they laughed from the same silly things that we do today. You’ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more… FIGHT LIKE AN INKULINATI Inkulinati are a legendary group who battle one another on the pages of medieval manuscripts. They fight by drawing Beasts with the Living Ink. Thanks to this magical substance, those creatures come to life and an epic battle ensues.Move your Beasts across the battlefield, perform actions on or with them, make tactical use of obstacles and collect more Living Ink to draw new Beasts which allows you to gain an advantage over your opponent. MULTIPLE DEADLY (AND BIZARRE) BEASTS TO UNLOCK Donkeys playing trumpets with their bottoms, bishop cats vanquishing heretics with prayers, heavy but deadly snails that eat units alive, and more. Much, much more. They all have their special skills and are waiting for your command. SPECIAL, BATTLE TIDE-TURNING ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE INKULINATI It’s not just your Beasts that can cause havoc and damage. Use your fists to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too. ADAPT YOUR TACTIC TO EVERY BATTLE Each Inkulinati has its own army, with different Beasts, who in turn, have different abilities, strengths, and unfortunately, weaknesses (or fortunately - depending which side you’re on). But it’s not just the armies that can influence who will win any given duel. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. You will have to use your wits and adapt your strategy to beat the opposing Inkulinati’s army on each specific Battlefield. A SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN Uncover the mystery and secrets of Inkulinati and face such opponents as Death, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure! Fight the biggest Inkulinati masters in the land, tame the untamed Beasts, build your ultimate army, try to bring back your Master from the clutches of death, and most importantly, finish your grand quest with the biggest party that the middle ages have ever seen! Howza!!! CREATE AND DEVELOP YOUR OWN CHARACTER As any aspiring Inkulinati Master, you will get to create your own Tiny-Inkulinati. During your journey you will learn the secret techniques of drawing new Beasts and Inkulinati Hand Actions, allowing you to choose the composition of your army. You can be a brave knight that has no fear and will send his loyal troops straight at his opponents. Or perhaps you would like to play with a bit more tact? In that case, you can be a nun who with the power of prayer can confuse her enemies and heal thy own servants. Those styles, and more, are waiting to be discovered and made your own. Express yourself!","2024-09-24","/game/93893","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202401/0510/a714fa2b04bc7e35aacd1b750cc3927b8a52a678c0014336.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8923-PPSA19581_00-INKULINATIEUPS50","35%","18","Strategy, Strategy","525","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/inkulinati","Inkulinati","TRD","Daedalic Entertainment GmbH","2024-02-22","inkulinati-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","9","568.75","1","",
"79","2024-10-09","This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5Â® version of this game. Play as the #2 best investigator as you find clues, question silly suspects, and look at things through your magnifying glass. Some nay-sayers have called the magnifying glass ""useless"", but what do they know? In Case 1, The Haunted Island, a sloth has been haunted for weeks by a mysterious ghost that nobody can seem to track down. Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective. In the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbor has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbor is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer. In the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all... This final mystery is jam-packed with twists and turns, a true love letter to the Frog Detective fans. Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery is a family-friendly yet witty take on the detective game genre. Solve the mysteries on your own, or play along with friends as you take turns reading out the dialogue. Think you can crack the case?

"75","2024-10-09","Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison takes on a quest to slay evil transhumanist mastermind Dr. Jadus Heskel in the streets of Neo DC. She leaves a trail of carnage throughout huge, multi-path levels filled with gigantic explosions, more secret areas than we can count, and inhuman foes behind every corner. There’s no regenerating health here; stop taking cover and start running and gunning. Shelly’s crusade to take down Heskel’s army will see her leave destruction in her wake with a wide arsenal of weapons, complete with alternate fire modes and different ammo types. Ion Fury laughs at the idea of mandatory checkpoints and straight paths through shooting galleries. But, just because this is a true old-school first-person shooter doesn’t mean we've ignored all the good new stuff the last two decades have brought. Headshots? Hell yeah. More physics and interactivity? You betcha. 3DRealms, Voidpoint and Fulqrum Publishing have taken the best of both worlds and cooked it all into a bloody stew. Features: • The true successor to classic shooters such as Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, and Blood. • Experience the original BUILD engine on steroids, pumped up and ready to rock again after 20 years! • Duck, jump, climb, swim, and blast your way through 7 exciting zones packed with multiple levels of mayhem! • A beautiful game world assembled from thousands of hand-crafted textures and sprites • An awe-inspiring arsenal of devastating weapons, including multiple ammo types and alternate fire modes. Tri-barreled revolvers, grenade launchers, and heat-seeking smart bombs are your best friends! • The classic '90s FPS action you love, meshed with modern inventions like locational damage and seamless level transitions • ZERO PROCEDURAL GENERATION. All levels are hand made and full of multiple paths, cool effects, and complex set pieces! • Thumping soundtrack comprised of true tracked module music, in authentic FastTracker 2 format","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202004/2114/YDhu5iW6HgFsb9T0dpH9JA2m.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2632-CUSA14704_00-IONFURY0000000EU","75%","0","Action, Shooter","175.8","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/ion-fury","Ion Fury","TRD","Fulqrum Publishing Ltd.","2020-05-14","ion-fury-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","879.00","0","219.75","1","",

"75","2024-10-09","The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. STORY MODE The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episodes 1+2 were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - “DO NOT GO GENTLE” Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - “LUMINACE FUGUE” Mackenzie’s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? EPISODE THREE - ""CROSSROADS ELEGY"" In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? EPISODE FOUR - ""FURY, THEN SILENCE"" A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. SURVIVAL MODE Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202109/2306/ChPARRL6cgDRc3GuWkLZOZIa.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2845-CUSA09690_00-TLDRKFULLGAMEPS4","50%","0","Action, Adventure, Adventure","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-long-dark","The Long Dark","TRD","Hinterland Studio Inc.","2017-08-08","the-long-dark-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","524.50","1","",

"74","2024-10-09","RAD is a 3D action rogue-like set in a post-post-apocalyptic world, where humanity has faced armageddon not once, but twice. Playing as a teenage protagonist, you must venture into the Fallow — an ever-changing, radioactive wasteland filled with unknown and unspeakable creatures. It is here that you will find the solution to heal the world, and transform the cracked, barren landscape into a lush source of new life. But humanity’s future comes at great personal cost, as the deeper you journey into unknown lands, the more you will expose yourself to gnarly toxins which will wreak havoc on your fragile human form. The fate of the world depends on you, your trusty bat, and whatever strange new abilities you gain as the world around you ravages your body — twisting and mutating you into something far less than human, but far more powerful. But forget all that — go grab that sweet bat and help save the world…or what’s remaining of it anyway! 1 player 7GB minimum save size DUALSHOCKÂ®4 Vibration Function Remote Play Supported HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You’re the perfect candidate for our test chambers!

Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot.

""IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN"" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others.

"66","2024-10-09","It’s time to dust off your overalls and hitch on your toolbelt in Manic Mechanics – a chaotic couch co-op game where you and up to three fellow grease monkeys pay a visit to the car-obsessed Octane Isle. Your mission? Work your way around the island’s six neighbourhoods – from the rust buckets of Betty’s Scrapyard to the spooky shores of Banshee Bay – challenging the Master Mechanics that rule each part of town. Repair as many cars, trucks, choppers, tractors, mini-subs (and even UFOs) as possible to prove your worth in this hectic race against the clock. No two games are the same as you work your way through 30 unique garage levels, each one more challenging than the last. Completing a garage is one thing, but mastering it and beating your best score requires coordination, skill and determination. Octane Isle is a great place to visit, whether you go solo or bring along your friends. In co-op mode, up to four players work together as a finely-tuned machine, tracking their team’s best scores, unlocking new characters and discovering hidden secrets as they explore Octane Isle together. Or maybe you'll choose to head straight to the Versus Arena, split into teams and decide once and for all which crew truly rules the workshop? Whether you choose co-op or competitive, the action unfolds across local, wireless and online play. Just about anything can happen on Octane Isle... the faster you work, the more chaos is unleashed. Fuel ignites, tyres explode, robots short-circuit, cows stampede and aliens abduct, but with teamwork, skill - and maybe just a little luck - you'll earn the right to call yourselves a Manic Mechanic!","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/1217/0294dbfc7dc1e7d7e066e4b535deb26be7bbd922692ce90e.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8733-CUSA44406_00-0738875014798914","50%","0","Casual, Family, Party","335.6","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/manic-mechanics","Manic Mechanics","TRD","4J Studios Ltd.","2024-03-06","manic-mechanics-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","839.00","0","419.50","1","",

After the animals of Torch City were defeated by the invading Robotic Legion in the Resistance War six years ago, former Resistance fighter Rayton the rabbit has kept a low profile. The arrest of a friend meant he had no choice but to put on his giant metal fist and fight against those oppressing him. Little did he know that he would soon be caught up in a maelstrom of conspiracies involving the Legion, the Resistance, and the Rat Gang. â—�Seamless Maps Filled with Challenges to Explore Explore more than a dozen unique areas in a Action Platformer style map. The core combat, puzzle-solving, and platform mechanics are complemented by countless hidden rooms, secret passages, and shortcuts, with all kinds of rewarding challenges for players to complete. Maps are loaded on the fly to avoid frequent transitions, making the massive Torch City feel even more detailed and alive. â—�An Arcade Combat System with Seamless Switching between Three Weapons The Fist, Drill, and Whip are three weapons with completely different fighting styles that offer seamless switching between high combo, high damage, and long range attacks. Pummel the enemy by choosing the most appropriate form of attack for the situation. Players will be challenged by dozens of distinct types of enemies, each with their own weapons and attacks, all working together to bring the player down. Unique bosses with unusual fighting styles provide a new and unique gaming experience. â—�Diesel-punk Aesthetics Crafted with Unreal Engine 4 The game's diesel-punk aesthetics were inspired by diesel combustion engines that were blended with an Eastern cityscape from a bygone era to give Torch City a signature one-of-a-kind visual feel. The stark contrast between furry animals and sterile mechanical soldiers introduce the theme of conflict in the game story. The realistic 3D visuals powered by Unreal Engine 4 combined with Physically-Based Rendering take the Action Platformer genre to a whole new level of graphics quality.","2024-09-24","/game/83127","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1407/a0v5crJH2yW6mjjLVLI5TeHB.png?w=200","12","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8192-PPSA03969_00-FISTSIEEPS5HD002","60%","20","Action","101.43","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/fist-forged-in-shadow-torch","F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch","TRD","Shanghai Hode Information Technology Co.,Ltd.","2021-09-06","fist-forged-in-shadow-torch-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","289.84","16","115.93","1","",

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You’re the perfect candidate for our test chambers! That being said, welcome and good luck!

Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to. Scale Massive Beasts ------------------------------- Overcome impossible odds to climb atop and defeat the massive beasts that are bound to this land. Climb, Glide, Swim ------------------------------- You can climb on virtually anything you can get your hands on, from ruins and mountains to the massive beasts that inhabit the land. Ascend to the tops of mountains and then glide over the open world to reach previously inaccessible locations. Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don't stay in too long or your swim could become your last.

Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn't the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait. Make Your Path ------------------------------- Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course. Unravel the Mystery ------------------------------- Why won't the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to. A Beautifully Frigid World ------------------------------- Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog. The remnants of an ancient civilization lie before you, but don't let awe turn into carelessness -- snow storms can crop up at any moment and bury you in a blizzard. Luckily, you can leave footprints in the snow and follow your footsteps back if you are lost.","2024-09-24","/game/64731","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png?w=200","6","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1863-PPSA02191_00-0442182297085207","60%","19","Unique","367.15","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/praey-for-the-gods","PRAEY FOR THE GODS","TRD","No Matter Studios LLC","2021-12-14","praey-for-the-gods-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","11","419.60","1","",

In the year 2049, the once-promising lunar research base, named ""AstroGenica Lunar Nexus,"" has become a haunting beacon in the desolate expanses of the Moon. Serving as humanity's gateway to the cosmos, it now stands as a chilling testament to an experiment gone wrong. As the protagonist, you awaken in the cold sterility of the medical bay, disoriented and alone. The eerie silence is broken only by the hum of malfunctioning machinery. An unsettling darkness envelops the lunar base, casting shadows that seem to writhe and pulse with malevolence. Exploring the abandoned corridors and chambers, you discover cryptic remnants of the crew's activities – hasty recordings, fragmented logs, and ominous experiments conducted in the name of advancing human knowledge. It becomes clear that the crew's scientific pursuits unleashed an ancient extraterrestrial force, one that feeds on fear and has twisted reality within the confines of AstroGenica Lunar Nexus. The nightmare deepens as you encounter grotesque manifestations of the crew's worst fears brought to life by the insidious lunar entity. Each step forward reveals more about the base's descent into madness, and the horrifying fate that befell those who once called it home. Armed with only a flickering flashlight and your wits, you must navigate the increasingly nightmarish lunar landscape, solving puzzles, avoiding otherworldly threats, and piecing together the fragments of a dark cosmic secret. The lunar base holds the key to your survival, but it also harbors the eldritch horrors spawned by humanity's reckless curiosity. As you inch closer to the heart of the lunar nightmare, the line between reality and delusion blurs, and the chilling truth awaits discovery.

To succeed you need to plan your journey carefully by preparing appropriate equipment, choosing a suitable trail, facing extreme weather conditions, and surviving. Conquer your limits, overcome your fear, and reach the sky. REACH THE SUMMIT Each expedition is different, and the journey to the top is challenging. Conquer your fear, face your limits, and reach the summit. To do that: traverse dangerous trails using specialized equipment such as ice axes, lifelines, or carabiners. FACE NUMEROUS DANGERS During the journey, you will face diverse obstacles like blizzards, chasms, vertical walls, steep traverses, icy slopes, and crevasses. The key to success is to plan your next steps wisely and use the appropriate equipment at the right time. PLAN YOUR EXPEDITION Before setting off, decide which trail is best to the top taking into account weather conditions and the weather windows. Sometimes it's better to take a chance and choose a more difficult route, but thanks to this you can reach the summit before a snowstorm. SURVIVAL The key to survival is to have appropriate tools when you need them. Each piece of equipment has its weight but makes your next step harder. Ensure you have enough food to recover your strength, or you have a warm jacket and sleeping bag to warm up after a full-day climb. Good timing also plays a great role during the expedition. In the high mountains, where weather changes quickly and night falls very fast, plan ahead to set up camp in the right place that gives you a chance to recover before the next challenging day.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/2010/bdf3f9711c9ee7b1c54d3c3ee1f5c64a7de0287ddbb55d5d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7373-CUSA47953_00-0263727834759102","30%","0","Sport, Simulation","299.4","null","null","Climber: Sky is the Limit","TRD","Art Games Studio S.A.","2024-07-03","climber-sky-is-the-limit-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","0","349.30","1","",

"","2024-10-09","The latest standalone entry in the SaGa franchise, SaGa Emerald Beyond, brings together the very best elements of the beloved series to offer each player their own unique gameplay experience. Make use of glimmers and combos in battle; meet a diverse cast of races, including monsters, mechs, and vampires; and experience your very own story, created through your choices and actions. Distant Worlds Woven Together: Travel to 17 unique worlds from the Junction, either led by the hand of destiny or by a path forged by your own choices. Discover the completely different cultures and landscapes, ranging from a densely developed forest of skyscrapers and a green and luscious habitat covered in plant life to a world governed by five witches, or one ruled by vampires - just to name a few of the distinct settings. An Eclectic Cast of Protagonists: Six leading characters, all from diverse backgrounds and with vastly different goals, set out on their journey in five unique story arcs. They venture to the myriad of worlds for their very own personal reasons: One, a human on a mission to protect the barrier defending his city; another, a witch trying to regain her lost magic while maintaining her disguise as a schoolgirl; and yet another, a vampire lord out to regain his crown and reclaim the throne as the rightful king of his world. Even selecting the same protagonist for a second--or third or fourth--playthrough will lead to completely new events and stories, a completely fresh path and experience. A Story of Your Very Own Making: SaGa Emerald Beyond has the greatest number of branching plots of any game in the SaGa series. The story branches abundantly depending on your choices and actions. Every time you visit a world, the story will evolve, allowing the protagonist and player alike to discover new possibilities. As the story unfolds in this way it becomes a tale all of your own, not only affecting the path you walk but also the multiple potential endings that await each protagonist. Battles where a Single Choice Can Change Everything: SaGa Emerald Beyond further refines the highly strategic Timeline Battles the SaGa franchise has been long renowned for. With series mainstays such as the skill to spontaneously acquire abilities through the Glimmer system, tactical ally placement known as Formations, and United Attacks that enable individual skills to connect together to form devastating chain attacks, it offers the best iteration of SaGa's turn-based combat to date. The new combat system adds more drama than ever before, allowing you to support party members, interrupt enemy actions, and use United Attacks by strategically manipulating the order of ally actions. The characters that join you, the weapons you wield, your party formation, and your tactics in battle - everything is up to you!","2024-09-24","/game/137793","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/1110/3e091ae115b4cad403eb9f591e3c59cc1488ac656c9a4e0d.png?w=200","13","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0082-PPSA16123_00-SAGAEMERALDBYDEU","30%","57","Role-Playing","1224.3","null","null","SaGa Emerald Beyond -","TRD","Square Enix LTD","2024-04-24","saga-emerald-beyond--ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","29","1224.30","1","",
"","2024-10-09","Insurmountable is an adventure roguelike with permadeath, in which the player has to overcome huge mountains. Thanks to the procedurally created environment, no two climbs are the same. Make sure that your climber stays alive by always making sure that your vital values don't get into the critical range. This task is made more difficult by a dynamic weather system, day/night changes and a multitude of randomly generated events, where you never know in advance how they will end. Your decisions matter....every single one. Because anyone could be your last. Choose one of three characters with different skills and background stories and start by climbing the first mountain. Search crates, caves and ancient ruins for equipment from past adventurers. You'll need it, because even the first mountain will demand everything from you. But don't worry. As time goes by, you'll become stronger and stronger. Take advantage of a sophisticated skill system to determine which strengths your climber should have. In the course of each of the three mysterious stories, you will meet dangerous animals, overcome deadly abysses, encounter sinister and well-meaning characters, who do not always have to be human. Here, too, each of your decisions decides the following events. Three mountains have to be conquered at the end. One higher and deadlier than the previous one. Divide your forces and your equipment correctly, because you don't have a second attempt and you can forget about learning a route. In Insurmountable you have to cope with unknown dangers, react spontaneously to unpredictable events and realize in the end that, as in life, you can't always know the consequences of your decisions, but you have to cope with them anyway and in the end, it often turns out differently than you thought. Face the challenge of ever new and changing dangers, face snowstorms and the sheer force of nature, always keep your eyes on the summit and overcome the insurmountable.

"","2024-10-09","Dock, split, and form up! Pilot 3 fighters and take back the sun from the clutches of evil! Get the SOL CRESTA Complete Set at a great new price that offers the slick and speedy gameplay of the main game's Arcade Mode, the densely woven story of the Dramatic DLC, and the Legendary Fighters DLC that includes the legendary fighters from the CRESTA series. What you get in the SOL CRESTA Complete Set: - SOL CRESTA main game - SOL CRESTA Dramatic DLC - SOL CRESTA ""Legendary Fighters"" DLC Set (CR47, Wing Galiber, Wing Galiber II included) Note: The SOL CRESTA Complete Set consists of the SOL CRESTA main game and all DLC packs that are currently available to purchase, with no exclusive content. Be careful of duplicate purchases. PlatinumGames’ NEO-CLASSIC ARCADE series carries on the spirit and fun of classic gaming using modern technology, and the first project in this endeavor is SOL CRESTA. SOL CRESTA takes the docking and formation strategies of classic shooting games Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta and elevates them with the “free-form docking” system. The flagship Yamato, composed of the fighters Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susano can utilize various attacks depending on how the three ships are aligned. Docking, splitting, and reforming the ships as needed is the key to defeating the invading armies of Mega Zofer. Story Humanity faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Mandler Army during their last invasion of the solar system. Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune. With the last of their hope, they formed the solar recovery squad SOL CRESTA, and placed the fate of the solar system with the Yamato, a cutting-edge docking ship. - Free-Form Docking The Yamato, standing against the evil of Mega Zofer, is composed of 3 fighters. You’ll scramble with only one fighter at first, but pick up the right item and friendly fighters will appear for a power-up! Dock and split to change your attack properties and use different formations to access an amazing arsenal. - Classic 80s-Style Excitement SOL CRESTA’s music is provided by legendary chiptune composer Yuzo Koshiro, and the game pays homage to the sound and visuals of the earlier Cresta series games, bringing back that arcade fever while taking it beyond mere nostalgia. There’s even a time limit, high score Caravan Mode, and online leaderboards. - PlatinumGames' New Challenge What would happen if PlatinumGames, developers of satisfying and jam-packed action games like Bayonetta, NieR:Automata, and ASTRAL CHAIN tried their hand at shooting? This is the answer. The visuals are classic, but the originality and depth of the systems and gameplay provide a fresh and deep shooting experience that grows each time you play. Note: The SOL CRESTA Complete Set consists of the main game and all DLC packs. The Dramatic DLC adds the Dramatic Mode to the game, which presents a dramatic storyline featuring an array of unique characters. The ""Legendary Fighters"" DLC adds three additional playable fighters in the form of CR47, Wing Galiber and Wing Galiber II.

Among the multitude of weapons created, an autonomous weapon resembling a young girl was completed. Her arms could crack the earth like a whip, demolish any building in her path, and her red eyes mercilessly killed people one after another. This girl was named 'Holly' by the people, and due to her overwhelming power, she was sealed deep within the earth. After tens of thousands of years, the only emotion Holly felt upon awakening from her slumber in the dark magic ruins was an insurmountable hatred for humans. ""Humanity, perish."" Even though her weapon functions have degraded and she can now only slightly damage the ground or walls, Holly's vendetta against the world above has just begun. â–¼Features of Ancient Weapon Holly 1. Intense combat. 2. Strategic gameplay that lures enemies into pitfalls. 3. Exhilarating action of burying enemies you've trapped in pitfalls. 4. Holly's evolution and unlocking altar functions lead to deeper strategies. â–¼Intense Combat In the dungeons, a moment's hesitation can be deadly. Breath-taking, intense combat awaits you. Face enemies with overwhelming strength and seize the fleeting moments of opportunity for strategic battles. â–¼Strategically Lure Enemies into Pitfalls Break the ground and block the enemy's path. This is your way to survive. Predict the enemy's movements, create pitfalls, and capture them all. Strategic foresight, rather than straightforward combat, is essential in this game. â–¼Exhilarating Action of Burying Enemies in Pitfalls Lure enemies into pitfalls and bury them with your own hands. The thrill of this moment is one of the game's main attractions. â–¼Deepen Strategy with Holly's Evolution and Altar Unlocking Defeat enemies to acquire enhancement items. Use these items to evolve Holly and unlock the altar's functions! Experience a deepening of strategies as you play. With a skill tree format, a variety of enhancements are possible based on your strategy.","2024-09-24","/game/136057","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/0809/8fe68cbd7805ccffcd71583d093ec6e0757365398f3dfb8e.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6686-CUSA47485_00-HOLLYMAINGAME004","20%","0","Action, Action","503.2","null","null","Ancient Weapon Holly","TRD","ACQUIRE CORP.","2024-03-25","ancient-weapon-holly-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","629.00","0","503.20","1","",

"","2024-10-09","Solasta: Crown of the Magister brings back the thrill, tactics, and deep storytelling of tabletop games. As you play, you'll feel yourself reaching for your dice and miniatures. It's time to dive into the world of Solasta! Roll for initiative, take attacks of opportunity, manage player location and the verticality of the battle field. Set yourself up for the finishing strike and possibly roll a natural 20 at that key moment of a battle. In Solasta, you take control of four heroes, each with unique skills that complement one another. Every hero expresses themselves in the adventure, making each action and dialogue choice a dynamic part of the story. Players will create their heroes just as they would in a pen-and-paper game by choosing their race, class, personality, and rolling for their stats. You make the choices, dice decide your destiny. An Epic Team Adventure Discover the shattered world of Solasta. Explore ruins and dungeons for legendary treasures, learn the truth of an age-old cataclysm—and stop it from happening again. Create your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. Tailor your squad to your preferred strategy and maximize your party's abilities. The choice is yours. Online Multiplayer Co-op Play any campaign with up to 4 players for more fun and shenanigans! The best part? The host shares all their DLC with the other players! Time to fireball some friends. Discover a Mysterious & Dynamic World Delve into long-forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. Fight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over—on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground. Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. Size also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though—the monsters are also thinking vertically. Custom Campaigns In Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the official campaign is over. Download and play new Custom Campaigns with friends, made by the community with a push of a button! From the room layout, monster composition, and treasure the party will find, down to the decoration and lighting of each room or the music track playing—everything is handcrafted with love and care.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0816/adcba6a68e07cdb12b1a1dd453cb29a6ad6a6a368464a899.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5789-PPSA17744_00-0141723598888133","60%","0","Role-Playing","314.7","null","null","Solasta: Crown of the Magister","TRD","TACTICAL ADVENTURES","2024-03-06","solasta-crown-of-the-magister-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","0","419.60","0","",

Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here.

"","2024-10-09","You wake up stranded, after seemingly crashing your ship on The Sarcophagus — a giant, space-drifting, cosmic uterus holding an ancient demonic being known as ULTROS. Trapped in the eternal loop of a black hole, you will have to explore The Sarcophagus and meet its inhabitants to understand the part you play. Are you the gruesome breaker of this cycle, or can you become a link from destruction to rebirth? A PSYCHEDELIC SCI-FI JOURNEY ULTROS is set in a multifaceted realm - a vast alien landscape teeming with life. Grounded in science fiction, ULTROS comes wrapped in both an eccentric art style from the visionary El Huervo, renowned for his work on Hotline Miami, and a mystical soundtrack composed and performed by Ratvader – Oscar Rydelius. ULTROS explores meta-themes of mental health, life, death, and karmic cycles through deep lore and environmental storytelling. A WORLD OF CONTRAST Experience brutal, intimate, close-quarter combat with cosmic lifeforms, driven by a sense of urgency – where precision is paramount and every cut of your blade counts. Yet this intense combat is juxtaposed with cultivating the greenery and tending to plant life in The Sarcophagus, providing precious moments of contemplation and peace. In turn, this grants deeper access to obscured paths. A MYSTERIOUS, LAYERED LOOP The rich world of ULTROS holds many secrets for those curious enough — and fearless enough — to seek them out. A unique loop-based mechanic will allow you to start over at key moments in the story, providing opportunities to unfold such secrets, unlock different areas of the world and new abilities on a branching skill tree.

"","2024-10-09","""Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined,"" wrote Albert Camus, and it is hard to disagree with this. To contemplate one's life means to knock oneself down, to stop, to begin to go over one's experiences, to discard the superfluous and unnecessary, to destroy the old in the hope of constructing the new, in other words, to be undermined. It is impossible not to note the severity of this word because this action is associated with pain, loss, the need to choose difficult routes, and sometimes taking risks so as not to make new mistakes and not to fall off the set path. But is it worth enduring the pain? What happens if we simply go with the flow? How will our lives turn out then? The French philosopher Albert Camus asked similar questions in his famous essay ""The Myth of Sisyphus. In brief, the ancient Greek myth is as follows: the gods condemned Sisyphus, because he was too arrogant and too dodgy, to roll a huge stone up the mountain, which kept falling and had to start all over again. It would seem that what could be worse than this useless work? What was Sisyphus thinking as he climbed to the top of the mountain? And what do we care about him? Maybe we should admit that our lives are a bit like this Sisyphus? Approach Albert Camus's thoughts and feelings, his philosophy. Perhaps you will find some answers to these difficult questions. • Explore the world around you and find philosophical notes. • Take the stone to the top, higher and higher, and if it falls, well, start over, that's your punishment. • Choose your path correctly. Your decisions will determine the end of the game. • Discover the philosophy of Albert Camus. Don't try to understand every word, just let it pass through you. • Enjoy the abstract game world, and find different ways of passing. • And also listen to atmospheric music and sound effects.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/1720/2ec7923b93669974f8483c69eb15b79f726c80c93b2ed5f8.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2029-CUSA44262_00-0936199158514762","75%","0","Adventure","69.8","null","null","Heavy Burden","TRD","Whale Rock Games OOO","2024-01-23","heavy-burden-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","87.25","1","",

But what happens when you hurl a meteor at a poisonous puddle? Poisonous meteor explosions, that's what! And that's just one of the many nefarious ways that you can combine elemental interactions. You can afflict villagers with flaws. Sure, you could just destroy the world with ice and fire, but the real fun begins when you meddle with villager lives to put them into compelling and tragic situations! Afflict an annoying husband with Unfaithfulness and then watch the fireworks once you tell his wife of his misdeeds. You can spawn monsters to kidnap and harass villagers. You can snatch or seize a roaming monster and then breed it in your Kennel. This will allow you to summon them as part of your monster parties. Create monster parties to snatch Villagers or raid Villages. You can spread malicious info. Your Beholder Structure allows you to spawn Eyes all over the world to gather information. You've seen a Knight steal a Shaman's Potion? Store it as an Intel and then tell the Shaman about it! You can spread Plague. Build the Biolab to afflict Villagers with Plague and summon Plagued Rats. Upgrade your plague with various nasty symptoms and improve its virulence. You can even make Plagued victims explode when they die! You can torture people. You can build a Prison and incarcerate villagers. If necessary, you can torture them in ridiculous ways to afflict them with random flaws. Perhaps someone will have mental anguish and become a Serial Killer when it gets back to its village? You can brainwash folks into becoming cultists. You can also try to brainwash your prisoners. If successful, it will return to its village as a secret cultist who will quietly worship and aid you. You can start a zombie apocalypse. You can also make the Plagued dead rise as zombies. Other villagers that they attack may also contract the virus. Soon, the entire village will be filled with nothing but shambling zombies. You can make Vampires and Werewolves. Afflict a Villager with Vampirism or Lycanthropy to turn them into denizens of the night. Watch as they terrorize their neighbors and spread the curse! You may eventually see the Village fight back and start hunting.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202307/0408/782c0b448a08011a5034a72afc47469691b22b173f6453c7.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA16282_00-0983744731522398","40%","0","Simulator","999999","null","null","Ruinarch","TRD","Klabater","2023-12-07","ruinarch-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","0","525.00","1","",

"0","2024-10-09","The Absolute Evil and its trusted *cough* servant, the Dark Elf Thalya, return in Dungeons 4 after the events of its fabulous predecessor to bring about their triumph over the forces of good once more. Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise. But what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart. Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilnessâ„¢. Features: • Everything is better with Dwarvesâ„¢: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources. • It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! • Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. • New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. • Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. • Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. • Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. • Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together. All maps from the skirmish mode and the campaign are playable in co-op.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/1915/407e9634ffec30d4768d5000791fb0a0f8bccfdf69ede7c0.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA07937_00-D4DELUXEEDITION0","20%","0","Strategy","1679.2","null","null","Dungeons 4 - Digital Deluxe Edition","TRD","Kalypso Media GMBH","2023-11-08","dungeons-4-digital-deluxe-edition-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","1679.20","0","",

"","2024-10-09","A story from the legends, but in real history Winter War: over 500,000 Soviet soldiers attack Finland, a country with a population of 3,700,000, and the Finns drive them back, inflicting 5 times their own casualties. Continuation War: the Reds return with a total strength of 1,500,000 - almost half of the entire Finnish population - and the Finns stop them again. Finland’s survival in these two brutal wars against an enemy so vast was a true historical miracle. A miracle of heroism and valor. A miracle of the Finnish spirit of liberty. Experience heroic struggle and make tough choices You are the commander of the scarce Finnish troops. Your only goal - to save your homeland and your people from total annihilation. Would you risk losing your experienced troops to try and capture the enemy tanks? Would you try to save the stragglers during the retreat and risk losing everyone, or cut your losses and establish a new line of defense? Would you agree to negotiate with the Soviets that had treacherously attacked you twice before? Play two campaigns: historical and “what if” Historical campaign: Play through a number of missions throughout the 1939-1945 timeline, spanning three wars: Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War. The historical campaign will have smaller-scale but action-packed operations, covering all of the iconic historical battles. Complete numerous objectives grounded in history and narrated by a number of historical characters. Alternate history campaign: Play a shorter campaign with larger operations, centered around the “what if” events. Help the Germans take Leningrad, cut off the allied aid shipments to USSR by taking the port of Murmansk - that is only the beginning. Features: Immerse yourself into the history-driven gameplay: Thanks to cinematics before and after each operation you’ll watch history unfold through the eyes of the key historical figures of the time. Create and grow the army of your own design: Use a number of historical vehicles - all of which are available at historically accurate points in time. Train your troops and choose equipment: Choose various skills for your men as they gain combat experience. Combine units from different classes and acquire diverse equipment for them! Use historical heroes: Every unit could meet certain high requirements to generate a hero with a unique set of powerful skills. For Example the deadliest sniper in WW2 history - Simo HÃ¤yhÃ¤ Manage your Headquarters between the operations: More firepower or better intel - choose in which direction your HQ staff will improve. Use elaborate combat mechanics to overcome any foe: Lethal vs Nonlethal damage or using terrain differences to your advantage - those are just a few of the combat mechanics in-game. Utilize advanced supply and infrastructure systems: All units have limited ammo and fuel that are necessary to operate. You can use this and cut enemy supplies!","2024-09-24","/game/105469","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/0412/7be3130e648346b605f98c4c8947b69725d22aa371a8500d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA16443_00-0902122838417649","35%","0","Strategy, Strategy","999999","null","null","Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty","TRD","Klabater","2023-10-26","strategic-mind-spirit-of-liberty-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","0","681.85","1","",

"","2024-10-09","There’s an old tradition running in your homeland: to become an adult and complete the coming of age ritual, you must go on a journey of discovery. Your adventure begins on a distant island, deep in a tropical Archipelago. What was once a prosperous tourist destination is now a shade of its former glory: and it’s your job to bring it back to life! Explore the Archipelago, meet the locals, and lend them a hand to restore the tourist paradise… while you try to uncover the mysteries of your past! SETTLING IN A NEW PLACE Your tropical life will be a busy one, so grab your tools and let’s get started! First things first: you’ll need a source of food, a place to spend the night in, and some resources to build a farm and kickstart your tropical journey. So what are you waiting for — time to explore your lands! A PLETHORA OF ACTIVITIES There’s plenty to do in Spirit of the Island! No matter how you choose to spend your time, you will gain experience and improve your skills, unlock new recipes, and become more efficient at everything you do, which will make your new life easier. Spirit of the Island features 10 unique skills, such as farming, mining, foraging, social, and even fishing, which comes as its own special mini-game. Will you become a true master of all? YOUR JOURNEY TO A TOURIST PARADISE Make your island not only a welcoming home but also a booming tourist paradise, with fancy shops and landmarks. The more tourists you get, the better your economy will be, which is a crucial step to fund your journeys to the faraway Islands. But how do you please them all, and what do you sell in your stores? That’s where your skills will come in handy! Sell local produce; open museums to display the treasure and secrets you uncover on your adventures. We bet some of your visitors could even buy a couple of quality wooden planks, so do your best to improvise! THE BEST TRIP EVER Each tourist will have a chance to love your Island so much that they’ll decide to stay, adding to the Town’s population. This part is crucial since you can hire them to do various things for you, such as tending to your shops and helping you maintain the Island. So do your best to make their trip a fantastic one! THE POWER OF TWO One of the main features of Spirit of the Island is a 2-player cooperative mode, where you can do… everything together! You will have all single-player mode features available in online play with its own unique story. Grow crops, set up a store, and sell your produce to tourists, explore the vast Archipelago, and discover the secrets of the tropical paradise together with a friend! VAST TROPICAL ARCHIPELAGO Spirit of the Island features 14 explorable islands, each with its own fauna, secrets, and dangers. Information on who - or what - inhabits these islands has been lost to history, but you will find mysterious caves guarded by ancient creatures — are you brave enough to explore them and uncover the mysteries within? Doing so will net you neat rewards and help you proceed towards your final goal: revealing the secret of your past. THE LOCAL COMMUNITY The Archipelago is bustling with life! Meet more than 14 unique characters, each with its own distinct traits and quirks. And yes, there are romance options as well! Depending on your character, you’ll be able to romance and marry different NPCs and hold a grandiose wedding in the end! AN EVENTFUL LIFE One of the unique features of Spirit of the Island is events — a series of recurring occurrences happening through each in-game year (4 months). They will come in various forms: from birthdays and traditional Holidays to your own unique events. There’s always something fun happening in Town, so make sure to check your calendar often!","2024-09-24","/game/109925","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/1615/jfTgsNhsgDDUp0kpRg2yoevL.png?w=200","31","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1302-PPSA13934_00-0584770477306422","30%","0","Adventure, Simulation, Party","568.75","null","null","Spirit of the Island","TRD","Plug In Digital","2023-10-19","spirit-of-the-island-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","38","612.50","1","",

Battles occur on quarter-view maps with height differences, where character positioning in the front, back, and side of enemy units may very well determine each battle’s outcome. Support effects depend on where allied characters in your party are positioned, allowing players to enjoy highly strategic maneuvers. Players have a high degree of freedom in character development, such as acquiring and strengthening skills and changing classes by using skill points earned in battle. The characters are beautifully drawn with rich facial expressions by the illustrator Sakura Mochi! [Story] Several years have passed since a mysterious disease with no cure quickly spread across the continent. Those infected would suffer a horrible fate of turning into zombies after their death, mindlessly attacking the living. It has become the norm for hired mercenaries to spend countless days clearing the lands of the undead. Such a mercenary is Johann, captain of the Silver Wolf Mercenary Company. He is paid a visit by the Grim Reaper, and narrowly escapes its blade of death, but the Reaper leaves him with an eerie prophecy: ""In the next 100 days, your luck shall run out. That shall be the day of your fate.” After awaking from a delirious slumber, he is met by a young woman with miraculous powers that can heal people from the disease. Was his encounter with the Grim Reaper but a nightmare....? Regardless, Johann offers to protect the miracle worker on her travels to save as many people as she can. They set out on a journey to travel the kingdom, curing the infected.

We choose to play as either Matthew Kolth, an occult obsessed paranormal investigator, into nightmarish scenes to fight perturbing monsters from ghastly realms, or as Della Hartfort, as she slithers her way stealthy to avoid the same monsters Matthew is emptying his bullets upon. Join either Mr. Kolth or Mrs.Hartfort as they both try to make sense of a hellish adventure that leads them into the depths of their own psyche and back again. Live through their difference of reality-gaze which merges fiction and ethereal dream sequences and go on to fight against evil in this dimension…and the next. Matthew Kolth is a paranormal investigator at the turn of the century that takes on a new case at Hartford Mansion. There he meets Della, the wife of a rich businessman that believes her house to be haunted. She sees visions of demons and beasts of other dimensions. As a player, we have two deliberate choices: We either pick Matthew or Della, and both alternatives offer completely different play styles and adventures. Matthew must journey through the dream-like yet horror filled halls of the Hartford mansion before heading to Carcosa Asylum in pursuit of Della and the answers she holds. You must guide him from the bone chilling depths of his own psyche and back into stability all the while fighting terrifying monsters and trying to solve mind bending puzzles to progress through the game. Matthew must fight with enemies from outer space, other dimensions, and from the depths of his own soul to avail victorious from this mysterious and blood curdling case. Matthew must overcome his inner demons in a story that twists and turns as you must follow your instincts to find evidence – whether this evidence tells more about the case or about Matthew himself, is to be found out. Alternatively, you can play as Della and befriend with shadows. She will embark on the same path Matthew has ventured, however she would only have her stealth-wise skills to confront or avoid those monsters. Inevitably, her version of this dangerous undertaking will also trigger her soul to face her own inner demons as well, but perhaps she has a different spectrum of opinions on the same worldly matters of which Matthew has a “male-gaze” upon, her own interpretation, as an audacious Victorian-lady... *Two different playstyles…Third-person action/horror and first-person stealth/horror *More than 20 types of enemies to encounter, or to avoid, depending on your playstyle *Two different story-lines *Enigmatic puzzles and vast variety of locations from Victorian mansions to mysterious fantasy landscapes *Ominous dynamic soundtrack. *4K Resolution and Ray-Tracing","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/2913/1bb775393341fe2872c932d7f7f1f7292269be34ed73f367.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8070-CUSA18714_00-VENATRIX00000000","90%","0","Unique","26.25","null","null","VENATRIX","TRD","Playstige Interactive","2023-09-21","venatrix-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","0","52.50","1","",

Join either Mr. Kolth or Mrs.Hartfort as they both try to make sense of a hellish adventure that leads them into the depths of their own psyche and back again. Live through their difference of reality-gaze which merges fiction and ethereal dream sequences and go on to fight against evil in this dimension…and the next. Matthew Kolth is a paranormal investigator at the turn of the century that takes on a new case at Hartford Mansion. There he meets Della, the wife of a rich businessman that believes her house to be haunted. She sees visions of demons and beasts of other dimensions. As a player, we have two deliberate choices: We either pick Matthew or Della, and both alternatives offer completely different play styles and adventures. Matthew must journey through the dream-like yet horror filled halls of the Hartford mansion before heading to Carcosa Asylum in pursuit of Della and the answers she holds. You must guide him from the bone chilling depths of his own psyche and back into stability all the while fighting terrifying monsters and trying to solve mind bending puzzles to progress through the game. Matthew must fight with enemies from outer space, other dimensions, and from the depths of his own soul to avail victorious from this mysterious and blood curdling case. Matthew must overcome his inner demons in a story that twists and turns as you must follow your instincts to find evidence – whether this evidence tells more about the case or about Matthew himself, is to be found out. Alternatively, you can play as Della and befriend with shadows. She will embark on the same path Matthew has ventured, however she would only have her stealth-wise skills to confront or avoid those monsters. Inevitably, her version of this dangerous undertaking will also trigger her soul to face her own inner demons as well, but perhaps she has a different spectrum of opinions on the same worldly matters of which Matthew has a “male-gaze” upon, her own interpretation, as an audacious Victorian-lady... *Two different playstyles…Third-person action/horror and first-person stealth/horror *More than 20 types of enemies to encounter, or to avoid, depending on your playstyle *Two different story-lines *Enigmatic puzzles and vast variety of locations from Victorian mansions to mysterious fantasy landscapes *Ominous dynamic soundtrack. *4K Resolution and Ray-Tracing","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/2913/1bb775393341fe2872c932d7f7f1f7292269be34ed73f367.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8070-PPSA17930_00-0337079664242141","90%","0","Unique","26.25","null","null","VENATRIX","TRD","Playstige Interactive","2023-09-21","venatrix-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","52.50","0","",

"","2024-10-09","Weedcraft Inc explores the business of producing, breeding and selling weed in America, delving deep into the financial, political and cultural aspects of the country's complex relationship with this troublesome and promising plant. Would-be marijuana moguls will need to prioritize resources carefully as they manage the production and distribution of their weed. Cultivate killer plants, cross-breed them to create unique strains of the devil’s lettuce, hire and manage a growing staff, and be prepared to take on the competition. As in real life, the business of bud presents plenty of opportunity along with a plethora of problems. Decide when and where to take on extra risk to maximize profit, but be careful, the cops and politicians are all working their own angles. An important, controversial topic presented in an insightful and detailed manner, Weedcraft Inc presents a challenge to those who would rule the reefer, offering a series of diverse scenarios and unique characters to work with (or around) as your budding empire grows. Whether you choose to hobnob with politicians, pay off the police, fight for medical marijuana rights or work the legal system, it’s all in the name of the sticky icky and your cutthroat corporate profits. --- BEGIN WITH PASSION FOR MOONSHINE We love moonshin’. There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught!","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0410/3b69a8fabd03f283a64ce0ac05d6ac9ac2cd3e11aedd4138.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA29034_00-0157935667191883","35%","0","Simulation, Strategy","737.4","null","null","Weedcraft Inc + Moonshine Inc Bundle","TRD","Klabater","2023-08-24","weedcraft-inc-+-moonshine-inc-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1229.00","0","798.85","1","",

Of course the main ingredient would be some awesome top-down twin-stick shooting with a moderate amount of the clichÃ© “damsel in distress” story, add a pinch of puzzle-solving, sprinkle some classic hack-and-slash actions, and stir with all the deadly zombies and god-knows-what creatures, resulting in a satisfyingly intense and exciting gameplay experience! The Background – In a Crooked Little Town… Welp! Ricky's graduation trip took an unexpected turn when he arrived in this town, only to discover that its inhabitants had been turned into zombies!?? In order to rescue Ashley, a young girl he had also just met in this unfamiliar town, Ricky strolled into (or is thrown into?) an unexpected adventure, with the help of a mysterious talking skull named MC Skully. Waiting for him will be hordes of zombies, intricately designed challenges, and ridiculously tough bosses with some of the most absurd abilities. The Combat – LOCK N’ LOAD! Who knows! This town seems like a mega-arsenal! Whether you are a cool-headed sniper, close-quarters combat specialist, or grandmaster explosive engineer, you’ll find plenty of fun in Zombie Soup.

"","2024-10-09","It is now the Taisho era in a world similar to olden Japan during a period of rapid economic growth. Fighter jets, tanks, and battleships have entered the war, and giants known as Guardians and Mugen are tearing their way through the battlefield. This is the exciting stage of Akai Katana Shin, a horizontal shoot 'em up game. The Japanese-inspired military game visuals and gorgeous character designs portray a dramatic story of clashes between family and old friends. These elements are tied together by strategic game mechanics, which feature a wide variety of attack methods to experiment with. Find out for yourself why this game has such a strong base of ardent fans! Contains Three Titles From Cave's Akai Katana Series Akai Katana The first arcade game of the series released in 2010. Supports two players. Akai Katana Shin A home console version with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and new game features such as Hagane and Katana. Akai Katana Zetsu Based on Akai Katana with an aspect ratio of 16:9. Game mechanics have been adjusted for balance. From Strategy Crafting to Score Attack—Versatile Enough to Play It Your Way The player unit known as Fighter can switch between its normal form and a giant ninja known as Guardian using Soul-shift. The unit also comes equipped with two different bullet shots. Attack Mode has more power and Defense Mode boosts mobility. Make good use of a combination of forms and modes to break through enemy ranks and destroy them. Soul-shift is a crucial technique that boosts the player for a short while. In Akai Katana and Akai Katana Zetsu, timing the shift well can block enemy bullets even on a screen that's full of them. In Akai Katana Shin, generate and fire a Katana shot to quickly defeat strong enemies. The highlight of this title is the ability to negate or dispel attacks instead of simply avoiding them. Make good use of Soul-shift to turn the tide in your favor and earn a higher score. Quality Game Modes Packed With Features Settings: Adjust options such as sound volume and screen display. Turn Screen Frame on to see captions for character voices during the game. Training: Specify a stage and adjust your unit's condition to carry out individual training.

"","2024-10-09","BEGIN WITH PASSION FOR MOONSHINE We love moonshin’. There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner. You will progress through main missions, you’ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises... If you’ll be prospering, you’ll get the chance to create and manage bases in five different regions, each with its own, more and more challenging missions. From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there’ll be a pesky agent who’ll want to work with you, and there’ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You’re a free man, after all. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught! Features: [*]a faithful reflection of the moonshine craft - fermentation and distillation based on chemical formulas behaving as natural processes [*]a realistic recreation of an American moonshiner’s business, with all its challenges [*]a rich story - 3 possible successful endings or a “Game Over” if caught by the authorities [*]5 regions - running the base in the mountains, forest, swamps, town, and city, with linear progression [*]70+ recipes - 15+ moonshines, 15+ whiskies, 20 brandies, 20+ vodkas [*]50+ ingredients - sugars, fruits, vegetables, and grains [*]35+ apparatuses - 17 distillation stills, 8 fermentation tanks, 5 post-distillation tanks, 7 pre-fermentation apparatuses, and more [*]26 fermentation and distillation technologies [*]37 main quests + side quests and road events [*]Original Score - 19 tracks that embrace the vibe of illegal activities in American mountains.

Briar and Lute are sent on a mission to reclaim a city in ruins, only to discover that the Order they belong to has a more complex plan in mind. Explore a striking, fantasy-inspired world brimming with hidden mysteries, master a diverse combat system, and inhabit the dual forces of two sisters in a coming-of-age fantasy story with fast-paced action, vicious enemies, and spectacular boss fights. FEATURES • Fight in Synergy - Manage sisters Briar and Lute simultaneously. Master melee attacks and combos as Briar and take control of the battlefield with otherworldly abilities as Lute. Combine their strengths to unlock powerful, transformational abilities and tap into their true potential as Chimera. • Explore a City in Ruin - A Tear in the Sky has opened above the once-holy city of Ilden. As Briar and Lute fight to reach the Tear, they’ll face challenging puzzles and unveil secrets of the Order while their surroundings become more hostile and twisted. • Customize Weapons and Abilities - Weapons are unlocked and upgraded throughout the game and can even be switched on the fly to unleash stylish and highly devastating combo attacks. • Battle Different Enemy Classes - A vile mix of Wraiths, Corrupted and Possessed, have poured into the world from beyond the Veil. Utilize Lute’s unique auras to expose or weaken these creatures and adapt to a flow of battle that never feels the same. • Learn the Truth of Your Origin - Through a dark story filled with sisterly love and sacrifice, Briar and Lute discover the truth about themselves and their Chimera powers while working together and staying true to their unbreakable bond.

Based on the rider selected, playing and controlling your rider is now different. It's easier to reach maximum speed and to take certain trajectories tightly with a rider like Wout van Aert than with PrimoÅ¾ RogliÄ�. But be careful, because the lower the Downhill and Agility ratings of your cyclist, the more control you need! STAND OUT FROM OTHER RIDERS To add more immersion to the core of Tour de France 2023, we added two new bibs this year. You can now see and wear the """"super combative"""" bib and the best team bib. Prove you deserve to wear these distinctions by showing your panache! As in real life, riders can form a """"grupetto"""" to make a breakaway or if they have fallen behind. This helps to limit damage during difficult stages and conserve energy for future stages or the end of the race. SMOOTHER RACES In Tour de France 2023, trajectories and collisions have been redesigned so you can navigate within the peloton more easily. Thanks to these improvements, you can reposition yourself more easily and prepare for the end of the race as ideally as possible. All ratings have been updated based on the results of the riders' last season so that they reflect reality and the latest performances of professional cyclists. The Race of the Moment mode has also been updated with new challenges, races and optimisations that add more variety.

Now reading can also be a game for your children thanks to our exclusive methodology, GameReadingÂ®, for the development of a reading habit, which has been scientifically validated. BookyPets Legends transports children to the other side of the universe, the magical kingdom of Imaginatios which is inhabited by all the characters from fairy tales, and by magical creatures with book-shaped wings, the BookyPets! The game consists of freeing the BookyPets, who have been trapped by 3 evil monsters (Fear, Laziness, and Selfishness), by reading hundreds of proverbs, fables, tales, legends and children's novels, in order to get keys and open the cages in which they are locked up. They will be helped by numerous fairytale characters, although some of them will also try to thwart the mission! BookyPets seamlessly blends reading into the gameplay and narrative of the video game to encourage children to read. Now, reading and playing will be one and the same. Key features: - Game mechanics based on the most popular games for children aged 7 to 12 (RPG, Tower Defense, Collecting, etc.). - More than 50 BookyPets to rescue, collect and evolve. The Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Unicorn, the Blue Mermaid and the Winged Lion are just some of them - children won't stop reading until they manage to rescue them! The habit and passion for reading are already underway! - Character editor with dozens of customizable elements to create your own in-game avatars. - More than 2,200 fantasy readings: traditional proverbs and sayings, classic and modern tales, fables, and children's novels. - Your children will get rewards for each reading: spells, energy and keys to free their BookyPets. In addition, there are special rewards for daily reading. - Information about the children's progress and the readings they have done: number of words read, new vocabulary, type of readings done... - All the game texts and readings are bilingual: available in Spanish and English. - BookyPets is the first Metaverse of children's literature that also has its own collection of books, with more adventures to read and discover many more details of the Imaginatios kingdom.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/0814/7f4cee3d13f2c35840df530642fc18c3df93f5bbcf7e9132.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3291-CUSA42224_00-0261562778481502","50%","0","Adventure, Educational","279.6","null","null","BookyPets Legends","TRD","SPHERICAL PIXEL, S.L.","2023-03-29","bookypets-legends-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","349.50","1","",

The fearsome orc clans, more numerous than ever, lurk on all roads. The proud nomadic peoples of the steppes are on the alert, for strange beasts prowl the darkness. Not even the stout dwarves, hidden in their underground palaces, seem safe from threat - from the unknown tunnels of its mines, a foul army of hideous creatures advances inexorably. Chaos seizes the World. Only the memory of the oldest recalls the exploits of a hero and a few warriors, who in other times fought against the forces of Chaos. Ianna, the mother of all living beings, gave the hero a powerful sword to enter the abyss and defeat evil. But that happened a long time ago. A new hero is needed, a chosen one who is worthy to wield the Sword and destroy the enemy... this time forever. FOUR PLAYABLE CHARACTERS. Pick your Champion of Ianna — Tukaram, the Barbarian; Naglfar, the Dwarf; Sargon, the Knight; or Zoe, the Amazon — each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and fighting skills, as you hack ‘n slash your way through a blood-drenched quest to save the world from the forces of Chaos.

Even Astella, a harbour town far from the centre of the Vallois Empire, is no exception. Local gangs, slum dwellers, external forces, and secret societies – all these factions are clashing together over their own agenda and interests. Under such tension, the fragile peace here at Astella is on the verge of sliding back into all-out conflicts. In the midst of this crisis, a young boy and a young girl crossed paths. In the nick of the time, Sid, facing his impending death as a result of a series of unfortunate events, was luckily saved by a girl, Torii, who wields a special power – Chrono.

Once bound to a “Linked” by the mysterious “Chrono Pact”, a Chronus will be able to reach its maximum power as its ties with the “Linked” grow stronger.

In order to investigate an unusual crime, Sid and Torii together embark on a journey heading into the greater unknown. In this intricate intertwining of events, every decision made could shape the future of Astella Friends from Astella Bringing their visions and beliefs, as well as their unique personalities and circumstances, various characters will join Sid and Torii in uncovering the long-kept mysteries of Astella.

"","2024-10-09","The Gods have abandoned Midgard. Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","90%","0","Action, Adventure, Music/Rhythm","52.5","null","null","ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree","TRD","Untold Tales S.A.","2023-02-09","atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","0","52.50","1","",

Secondly there are golden flowers hidden everywhere in the levels that you can collect as a reward for exploring even the more hidden parts of the levels – collecting all of them unlocks an extra achievement in each level. Last but not least there are the bright shining knowledge shards that show you the way into the next area. Whenever you collect one the next one will spawn ahead of you and show you the right way. Once you have found a certain amount of knowledge shards you will be able to enter the next area and the story continues.

You have to perform increasingly complex tasks in prison, balancing the administration's assessment and inmates' satisfaction. In the game, you play the role of a prison guard and it is only up to you whether you decide to obey the law or let this place and people corrupt you completely. After all, who said you had to be an exemplary ranger? Maybe you prefer to trade with prisoners, help them smuggle, and bet on the outcome of fights in prison instead? After all, everyone likes to have fun sometimes. Especially in a sad place like this, where you are also the boss. Or at least you think so. So how? Will you choose to follow the rules, intercept contraband, count prisoners, send them to work, take care of their basic needs and keep prison gangs under control? Will you go to the dark side? Whatever you decide, remember that your actions will affect both the facility itself and the inmates, and above all, the further course of your career. Unique features of the game: - try to balance between following the orders of your superiors and doing small favors for the inmates. In doing so, you will maintain a fragile balance between both and benefit from the gratitude of both parties, - become the exemplary prison guard in campaign mode. Receive new prisoners, search cells for contraband for confiscation, view surveillance footage, maintain peace and order, react to inmates' acts of disobedience, and complete many other tasks assigned by your superiors, - or ignore all rules in Free Play mode. Do what you want, discover the farthest corners of the prison, explore the surroundings and interact with prisoners. Just remember that your every action will have an impact not only on other prison guards but also on the inmates themselves.

Play in free style or against the timer with one or two grappling guns and finish more than 10 enormous levels by dodging obstacles and deadly traps. It’s easy to play, it’s fast and it’s fun. You start the game in the middle of a giant city surrounded by skyscrapers. You look around and see a giant poster that explains the general movement. This way you learn that you are able to dash while being in the air. You also realize that you have a grappling gun in your hand and see floating crystals above your head. You aim at the crystals and use your grappling gun to hook onto them. Once hooked you start swinging and swing towards the next crystal. You hook on to the next crystal and have already mastered the main movement mechanism. After a couple of hooks, you realize that you can change your swinging direction and speed by dashing into the wanted direction. This is the second important thing to learn about the movement and gives you a lot of freedom in your movement. Soon you will reach the next giant poster which explains further movement patterns that you can use to improve your precision and movements. You learn that you can remove your grappling hook, use an in-air dash and then hook on to the next floating crystal to build up speed and energy. You can use this energy to collect hidden achievements, dash through activator crystals, that unlock new areas o the level, or speed run levels later on. Furthermore, you realize that the dash refreshes every couple of seconds which leads to an incredibly fast and satisfying movement once you are able to master it.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0616/xTpaVApaeqWLeKILuhVo3DMo.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6556-CUSA36652_00-7394737770687028","40%","0","Action, Casual, Family","174.5","null","null","Grappling Dash","TRD","EpiXR Games UG","2022-12-20","grappling-dash-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","209.40","1","",

Defend your city as five unique and devastating Kaiju grow in power with every attack. Unfortunately, they can't be killed, but can be slowed down and forced to fall back... for now. Monsters move towards the nearest building, and the scientists have mathed the exact odds of where they might go next. Build sacrificial army bases and airfields to distract the Kaiju. If standard methods aren't enough, deploy experimental weapons such as freeze rays and transforming mechas to keep them at bay. Or you can always park tanks and jets in the monsters’ path to slow them down (don't worry, we have a good insurance policy). If all your efforts fail, don't be ashamed and run away! Be prepared to evacuate the laboratory using transport trucks, boats, or planes when the Kaiju get too close. Play missions from all over the world as you progress through the fight against Kaiju in a 15+ hour story-based campaign. Throughout the campaign, you’ll have the chance to gain an advantage with upgradeable ACE units and Project Deck customization. Test your wits in tactical puzzles, command dozens of units in large-scale scenarios, and fend off repeated attacks in defense missions while developing your city economically. And if you’re hungry for more, test your command skills in weekly challenges! Features: Protect your city in a tactical battle with cannon-fodder tanks, jets, and more... unusual firepower. Face five different Kaiju - each with unique skills and potential for mutation. Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Do everything to stop the monsters, including sacrificing your units and buildings. Remember that you can’t kill Kaiju - you can only slow them down. Defend cities around the world in 15+ hours of campaign mode. Prove your command capabilities in weekly challenges.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202210/0313/kJJT6eZ2XQEGcGnoEGuKgzh6.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA33612_00-1692968410657931","55%","0","Strategy","279.6","null","null","Kaiju Wars","TRD","Klabater","2022-11-10","kaiju-wars-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","314.55","1","",

"","2024-10-09","Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, in most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-GASSTATIONSIM0EU","30%","0","Simulation","454.35","null","null","Gas Station Simulator","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2022-10-19","gas-station-simulator-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","489.30","1","",

"","2024-10-09","You are an American soldier. One of the distinguished 101st Airborne Division. Soldiers of the 101st fought hard and died but they followed orders. They made things that others couldn't. Do you want to be remembered? You'll have to earn it. Your companions have captured the German bunker during the Battle of Normandy, and your task is to defend it at all costs. Defend your bunker! It won't be easy though. The command has prepared a lot of missions for you to perform including: - Cooking - Soldiers are humans and between fighting, they need to rest, get fed, and regain their energy. The enemy won't wait for you to get ready. The day is short. Many tasks await you. Prepare food to regain some strength. - Scavenging - The sky is full of enemy aircraft. It's hard to get enough supplies from your allies. You must scavage whatever you can to survive. Search the bodies of those killed in battle - sometimes you will even find chocolate! Remember to check the supply regularly as you must also take care of your companions. Order wisely and share food. - Encrypting - If you don't have enough bandages, food, or ammunition, send a message to the command with a request for a supply drop. It is mandatory to enter the password in the Morse code. Receive encrypted messages and anticipate your enemy's plans. - Shooting, killing, and destroying - This is why you are here. Perform missions - be vigilant and make good use of your machine gun, anti-aircraft gun, and anti-tank cannon. - Survive or Die - Take as many enemies with you as you can. Let history judge you by your will and determination. Let everyone know that YOU were here and YOU've made the stand. Remember Soldier's fate... never changes.

"","2024-10-09","The town of Moonbury has always been wary of the advances of the outside world, preferring to rely on their traditional methods of healing. Until one day, when the mayor's daughter falls ill, and the local witch doctor can do nothing to help her, they are forced to look outside their small community for help. The Medical Association decides to send their most accomplished chemist - you - to help cure the mayor's daughter and convince the residents of Moonbury of the wonders of modern alchemy. Gain their trust and tend to each person when they fall ill in this open-ended sim RPG. Take care of residents. Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed. Diagnose symptoms and find a cure! Hmm... a low heart rate and a bloated liver. Shoulder cramps, perhaps? No, these are sure signs of burning lungs. This patient has been consuming too much gelatin! Easily remedied; you'll just need to craft some Minty Goblet. Gather ingredients out in the world. Once you've decided on a potion, ointment, or salve, gather ingredients from the surrounding environment using your tools. Upgrade your hammer, axe, and sickle for new swings and attacks to help with your day-to-day tasks. Watch out for changing weather conditions! You may find yourself caught out in the rain, a freezing blizzard, or even the baking heat of a desert. Confront nasty monsters for their materials. Sometimes you won't be able to gather the materials you need as easily as harvesting a berry bush, and you'll need to turn your trusty tools into weapons to collect materials from the monsters prowling the nearby wilderness. Combat is in real-time and, since you're a chemist, you'll be able to brew various concoctions to buff yourself or inflict status ailments on your adversaries, as well as various tools to aid you. Brew remedies in your cauldron. The ingredients you gather can be mixed in your cauldron to brew medicine, vitamins, and more. As you become more experienced, higher-level recipes will become available, requiring more ingredients but bestowing stronger effects. Enhance your cauldron to concoct more ingredients into your recipes for these more advanced remedies. Build relationships with the townsfolk. It'll take a little while, but your patients' health will be much better thanks to your efforts. Your reputation with them will increase, and they'll open up to you a little more. You may even find yourself growing particularly close to certain bachelors or bachelorettes. Upgrade the town and surrounding areas. Building relationships with townsfolk increases your approval rating, allowing you to improve public buildings and expanding the explorable areas around the town. You can also craft and buy new furniture to give your home a personal touch! Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. In the downtime between treating the community's ailments, you'll be able to freely explore in and around Moonbury. Get to know the inhabitants a little better, take a rest in the tavern, or go fishing to catch something for dinner. Moonbury is a delightfully charming location where time seems a little slower and life is just a little more relaxed than the big city. While the lighting will change throughout the day, with the bright sun streaking across the meadows in the morning and street lamps illuminating the town in the early evening, there are no time limits for game objectives. Spend time with a faithful companion. You didn't relocate to Moonbury alone! With you every step of the way is your loyal dog companion. Your pet can help you locate hidden items and point you in the direction of residents as they go about their day.","2024-09-24","/game/85618","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1514/macP3Eb2PKvBNNY2LhFNlzFx.png?w=200","20","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4293-PPSA02687_00-POTIONPERMITSIEE","50%","33","Role-Playing","349.5","null","null","Potion Permit","TRD","PQube Ltd","2022-09-21","potion-permit-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","28","349.50","1","",

People only care about survival and holding on to their humanity along the way. But it’s hard to live like an animal and not to feel like one.

Take part in the research expedition and be one of the first people to get inside the S.W.A.N. Institute since the reactor failure. You'll discover the place kept secret by ZSRR authorities, omitted during the evacuation after the Chernobyl disaster. Experience things that go far beyond the limit of human imagination. Face the danger locked behind the facility door. Find another expedition participant and discover the inhumane secrets of professor Kaydanovskiy - the founder of the facility. On the 26th of April 1986, a disastrous catastrophe had taken place. Reactor unit 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had broken down, which led to the explosion, and radioactive contamination of the vast area. At the beginning of February 1987 - 9 months after the disaster - a team of scientists from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology received signals that proved the existence of people operating in a previously evacuated area. Also, various, unexplained anomalies had been discovered. It turned out that signals came from the S.W.A.N Institute located near the city of Prypiat. Its name comes from the abbreviation Syndrome Without A Name - the term given to the group of symptoms that do not occur in any known and cataloged disease. The facility was conducting research on never seen before and disturbing neurological-psychological medical conditions. Scientists together with paramedics decide to venture inside the Institute to explore the place and rescue people that are probably still alive inside...","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202206/1511/8sM7IuOI5lKk281h7HntQoRt.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7373-CUSA34984_00-5624041656065253","70%","0","Horror, Puzzle","167.8","null","null","S.W.A.N.: Chernobyl Unexplored","TRD","Art Games Studio S.A.","2022-08-31","swan-chernobyl-unexplored-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","839.00","0","251.70","1","",

Alternatively, you can take more time to explore the full depth of the game and also let yourself experience the vast variety of additional possibilities - ranging from repairing and renovating your buildings and vehicles, over fishing, making honey, and growing vegetables to socializing with local folks, finding the love of your life and eventually founding your own family. Either way, a lot of fun (and hard work) is waiting for you while taking care of your life while growing your company and transforming both into a successful Lumberjack’s Dynasty. Features • Unique mix of forestry, logging and life simulation in first person view • Quest driven story line • Large, open world • Plenty of individual characters to interact with • Adaptable gameplay with huge variety of tasks • Skill system – learn and improve your skills to become better and more efficient • Economic system with different products and varying prices • Control heavy machinery and vehicles • Manufacture and sell logs, planks, bark and other wooden products • Repair, rebuild and expand your home and other buildings • Repair and work on specific vehicles • Take a rest from your lumberjacking and follow other activities such as fishing, growing vegetables, collecting fruit, making honey and cooking delicious meals • Earn social points and money as (partially interchangeable) currencies to further expand and develop your business • Find a wife and raise a family • Grow your Lumberjack’s Dynasty by making the right decisions","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/0607/PNqIKutXZfpFBCc3mHQbOLKR.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3550-CUSA32418_00-LUMBERJACKSDYNEU","60%","0","Simulation, Role Playing Games","262.25","null","null","Lumberjack's Dynasty","TRD","Toplitz Productions","2022-06-30","lumberjacks-dynasty-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","419.60","1","",

"","2024-10-09","Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is a standalone release of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed Dragonfall campaign, which first premiered as a major expansion for Shadowrun Returns. The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game making it the definitive version on consoles of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience. Man Meets Magic & Machine In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return… Key Features A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters. A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into. Command Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in. Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems.

"","2024-10-09","This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game. The Shadowrun Trilogy comprises 3 cult tactical RPG games taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which magic has re-awakened, bringing back to life creatures of high fantasy. Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades. Shadowrun Returns The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Nearly 10 years ago, creator Jordan Weisman returned to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return… Shadowrun Hong Kong - Extended Edition HONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world’s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. As an ex-con living in Seattle, you try to make an honest living but when your foster begs you to meet him in China, things turn grim and you find out the police are trying to arrest you. And by arrest, they mean to kill you on sight! Build your team of Shadowrunners, mercenaries with big personalities who can fight using mystical or technical powers, and turn the tables on the elite corporate and the police.

NEW FEATURES - New online mode with leaderboard - Race incidents (falls, illnesses…) - New preparation system - New interface on cobbled sections - More intense races with a more aggressive peloton and more collaborative breakaways - All 21 official stages of the Tour de France 2022 - New """"Primavera Classic"""" inspired by a major Italian race - 3 new teams: Eolo-Kometa Cycling Team, Caja Rural-Seguros RGA and Uno-X Pro Cycling Team- NEW ONLINE MODE: RACE OF THE WEEK Enjoy a new challenge each week, competing against players from all over the world as you try to reach the top of the leaderboard! The controllable team and objectives – e.g. win the overall classification, score more points in mountain stages – differ based on the race. NEW: RACE INCIDENTS You can now choose to enable or disable race incidents and their consequences. If you enable them (for yourself and your opponents or just your opponents), you can choose their frequency and enable or disable their consequences, which vary depending on the incident's severity: loss of power for a short or long duration, or even withdrawal. Be prepared to adapt because your strategy might need to be completely re-evaluated at any moment. NEW: RACE PREPARATION To add more unpredictability to races, a new preparation system has been added. Five random cyclists (from your team or in the peloton) will be especially well prepared for the race and five others may potentially underperform. Unfortunately, you can't know who these cyclists will be… You will need to keep an eye on all your opponents. OTHER IMPROVEMENTS To make the cobbled sections of races more immersive, we have added shuddering to the entire user interface. This new feature reflects the difficulty of cobbled sections. You have never experienced the Arenberg trench quite like this! In Tour de France 2022, the races are more intense than ever, with even bigger early breakaways and better collaboration in all breakaways. You will need to adapt your strategy accordingly!","2024-09-24","/game/110264","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202204/1509/v8sC3bO3hwhM164YQUWE3ngc.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06479_00-TDF2200000000000","80%","143","Simulation, Sport","419.8","null","null","Tour de France 2022","TRD","NACON SA","2022-06-09","tour-de-france-2022-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","419.80","0","",

Step into the shoes of a master freerunner as you vault, swing, roll, and shoot your way through this intense, action-packed adventure. Will you survive the ultimate freerun? Experience the rush of parkour Navigate city rooftops like a parkour pro. Grab ledges, jump from roof to roof, vault through windows, slide down cables, swing from hooks: your possibilities are limited only by your attentiveness, creativity, and reactive skill. Designed for virtual reality, you’ll feel the rush of leaping across impossibly wide gaps over dizzying heights. Don’t look down! Fight for your life at 1,000ft Once you’re a parkour pro, it’s time to turn up the heat. Turn on enemies, and the city will be crawling with snipers who want you dead. To survive, you’ll need to combine fast-paced parkour moves with strategic dodges as bullets fly your way. You’re not defenseless - equip your own weapon and experience the satisfaction of picking off a sniper mid-air, nailing your landing on the edge of a skyscraper, then flowing straight into a wall-run to line up your next target! Of course, if the enemies are too much to handle, you can always disable them and focus on pure parkour. ARCADE MODES Endless mode Infinite level generation provides unlimited challenging terrain. Build your score by landing jumps over impossibly wide gaps, nailing insane wall-runs, sliding under barriers, and swinging between buildings. There’s no turning back or time to stop - as the world quickly falls apart behind you. Oh, and did we mention the rooftops are crawling with snipers? Pull out your 9mm mid-air and pick them off as you glide across the gap between buildings. Time Run Mode Compete for the top spot on the leaderboard. In Time Run mode, it’s all about speed. As the terrain unveils itself ahead of you, you’ll need to visualize your route on the fly, and execute each move with precision. Arena Mode In Arena mode, you’re presented with a spacious section of the city’s rooftops, without the pressure of a creeping barrier coming up behind you. You have complete freedom of movement within this complex high-rise “arena” but you’ll be challenged with a variety of tasks. Examples include finding and collecting certain items , completing a specified route within a time limit, stealing an item without getting spotted by the snipers, or - simply - killing all the enemies! Arena mode feels even more like a real city, so enjoy the views… but try not to die.

Pilot 3 fighters and take back the sun from the clutches of evil in this free-form shooting game with the spirit of 80s shooting classics Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta. PlatinumGames’ NEO-CLASSIC ARCADE series carries on the spirit and fun of classic gaming using modern technology, and the first project in this endeavor is SOL CRESTA. SOL CRESTA takes the docking and formation strategies of classic shooting games Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta and elevates them with the “free-form docking” system. The flagship Yamato, composed of the fighters Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susano can utilize various attacks depending on how the three ships are aligned. Docking, splitting, and reforming the ships as needed is the key to defeating the invading armies of Mega Zofer. Story Humanity faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Mandler Army during their last invasion of the solar system. Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune. With the last of their hope, they formed the solar recovery squad SOL CRESTA, and placed the fate of the solar system with the Yamato, a cutting-edge docking ship. -Free-Form Docking The Yamato, standing against the evil of Mega Zofer, is composed of 3 fighters. You’ll scramble with only one fighter at first, but pick up the right item and friendly fighters will appear for a power-up! Dock and split to change your attack properties and use different formations to access an amazing arsenal. -Classic 80s-Style Excitement SOL CRESTA’s music is provided by legendary chiptune composer Yuzo Koshiro, and the game pays homage to the sound and visuals of the earlier Cresta series games, bringing back that arcade fever while taking it beyond mere nostalgia. There’s even a time limit, high score Caravan Mode, and online leaderboards. -PlatinumGames' New Challenge What would happen if PlatinumGames, developers of satisfying and jam-packed action games like Bayonetta, NieR:Automata, and ASTRAL CHAIN tried their hand at shooting?

They are clumsy, inexperienced and feisty but...they’ll have to endure each other’s company to get the dungeon’s treasure. However, a feeling of dÃ©jÃ -vu quickly arises... Guide this team of unlikely heroes in an adventure full of humor and chaos! The Naheulbeuk universe is an original creation by French author John Lang. It started as a very popular audio comedy series parodying role-playing games and heroic fantasy tropes. Now the story is available in English and as a video game for the first time!

"","2024-10-09","Before he was the world’s greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naivetÃ© of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCOFROGWARESUAK","85%","0","Adventure, Action","236.25","null","null","Sherlock Holmes Chapter One","TRD","FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","2021-11-15","sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1575.00","0","236.25","1","",

In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness.

DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. Deluxe Edition Content: • Unique Weapon: Transtar Trencher (PS5 Exclusive) • Unique Weapon: Eat The Rich Tribunal • Unique Weapon: .44 Karat Fourpounder • Character Skin: ""Party Crasher"" Colt • Character Skin: ""Sharp Shooter"" Julianna • Two Trinkets (equippable buffs) • Original Game Soundtrack Selections (*FORMATTED USB STORAGE DEVICE REQUIRED TO ACCESS AND PLAY SOUNDTRACK) DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane’s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself.

Fight countless enemies with a huge selection of gun turrets (in the form of comic heroes) and additional helpers (mines, air support, block wall) on more than 60 maps. Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

The gameplay is plot-driven and features many historical personalities such as Franz Halder, Heinz Guderian, Erich von Manstein, Erwin Rommel, Karl DÃ¶nitz, Wilhelm Canaris, Hermann GÃ¶ring, and others. Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg is the second installment in the Strategic Mind line of games.

"","2024-10-09","Strategic Mind: The Pacific is a turn-based strategy set in the WW2 period depicting the war between the USA and the Empire of Japan waged in the Pacific Ocean with mindblowing historical accuracy and attention to detail. It offers an immersive experience of commanding both sides of the conflict, allowing you to gain a unique understanding of the situation through the eyes of both sides' top commanders, resulting in enjoyable and insightful gameplay. Build up, train, and equip your troops with the newest weaponry available to maximize their efficiency and set sail for victory. The core element of the game is large-scale naval battles with numerous carrier ships bringing so much more aircraft into the battle for seizing control over the ocean. Upon overtaking the sea you will have to set foot on hostile land through a series of costly landing operations. You will have to make your naval, aerial, and amphibious forces act as one flawless mechanism - a task only a truly strategic mind can achieve.

Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race. A new recovery mechanic Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating.

Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race. A new recovery mechanic Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating.

At the end of the world, sometimes love is the ultimate crime. Story Cila, a veteran cop with a sour outlook and anger issues expects nothing more from life besides the smell of ozone, blinding neon lights and the ever-present manhole steam.

Soon Cila and Mara forge a unique - if sometimes uneasy - bond. Unbeknownst to Cila, just as her life begins to find its new normal, the technological giant Velta Labs gets wind of Mara's existence and takes a mysterious interest in the android.

Like the games that inspired it, Petal Crash features a variety of single player challenges in addition to an intense head-to-head versus mode. The rules are simple - push a block in any direction, and it'll keep going until it hits a wall or another block. If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage! Enter the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire. Eons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia. Each of them has their own wish, and their own story to tell. Challenge the Story Mode to take your chosen character through their tale, challenging all the others in fierce puzzle battles to assemble all seven Sacred Blossoms! Shoot for high scores in Solo Play, racing the clock or rationing limited moves to get the highest rank you can!

"","2024-10-09","PLAY FROSTPUNK: CONSOLE EDITION This version of the award-winning game from 11 bit studios is tailored to give console players the full Frostpunk experience: • Thanks to the special, dedicated controller scheme all important features of the game are quickly within your reach. • The Console Edition of the game already includes all the updates that have been released since its premiere on PC. THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.","2024-09-24","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000","85%","0","Strategy, Simulation, Strategy","0","null","null","Frostpunk: Console Edition","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2019-10-10","frostpunk-console-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","157.35","1","",

"","2024-10-09","Welcome to ChromaTec’s test lab! You’re here to test our newest, state-of-the-art military-grade color-technology: The ChromaGun (patent pending)! Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They’re not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”. Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied. The ChromaGun Bundle includes ChromaGun and ChromaGun VR. PlayStation VR is required for ChromaGun VR. ChromaGun VR supports Aim Controller.
