        "description": "Build a loyal band of followers and survive the journey across a broken world. Barely.<br /><br />Take on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents.<br /><br />You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.<br /><br />During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands.<br /><br />If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.<br /><br />You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode.<br /><br />Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.<br /><br />In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.<br /><br />If you can survive long enough to find it.",

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.<br /><br />From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddy bear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!<br /><br />Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?",

Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.<br /><br />Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the ''interludes,'' which were originally published separately, available now on PlayStation 4 for the first time. Also for the first time, it has been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).",

        "description": "Inspired by 60s pulp sci-fi movies, Albedo: Eyes From Outer Space is a first-person adventure game. Working as a night-watchman at a partially abandoned, secret research facility, you are knocked unconscious by a nearby explosion. Waking in the complex's basement you look up and see a gaping hole in the ceiling. Escaping the damaged building is only the start of your troubles and as you begin to explore the base you encounter strange, unearthly organisms. Is this all because of some sort of biological experiment gone wrong? You'll need to fight for survival as you unravel the mysteries and solve the problems that lie ahead.<br /><br />Albedo: Eyes from Outer Space developed by Z4G0 and IV Productions, published by Merge Games Ltd. © 2015.

However, the “original game soundtrack selections” are playable on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.<br /><br />DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />Deluxe Edition Content: <br />• Unique Weapon: Transtar Trencher (PS5 Exclusive)<br />• Unique Weapon: Eat The Rich Tribunal<br />• Unique Weapon: .44 Karat Fourpounder<br />• Character Skin: \"Party Crasher\" Colt <br />• Character Skin: \"Sharp Shooter\" Julianna <br />• Two Trinkets (equippable buffs)<br />• Original Game Soundtrack Selections (*FORMATTED USB STORAGE DEVICE REQUIRED TO ACCESS AND PLAY SOUNDTRACK)<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane's unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you'll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you'll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You'll experience DEATHLOOP's main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you'll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you're feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna's stylish sneakers and invade another player's campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    <br />Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.",

        "description": "FROSTPUNK: COMPLETE COLLECTION CONSISTS OF:<br /><br />Frostpunk – the full version of the highly acclaimed society survival game, which sold over 3 000 000 copies worldwide and won a number of critics awards.<br /><br />Frostpunk Season Pass - a set of three expansions of the Frostpunk universe:<br />• The Last Autumn is a turning point in the Frostpunk universe. Revealing the restless events of Site 113 and its struggle to construct the generator before the freezing veil shrouds the Earth, this prequel expansion broadens the Frostpunk universe by introducing a new environment, new Books of Laws and unique technologies, and presents a range of new buildings — all of which let you shape society and the city in unconventional ways.<br />• On The Edge expansion tells a story of citizens of New London sent for a special assignment after the Great Storm. It not only opens a brand new chapter set in the Frostpunk universe but also pits you against new challenges and offers unique mechanics, both in the city and on the Frostland map - further enriching the core experience.<br />• The Rifts allows you to experience a new level of challenge on a brand new Endless Mode map, where the land itself threatens your survival. Using a new gameplay mechanic, bridge the rifts to access new areas. Expand the city to save your people from the inevitable doom!<br /><br />ABOUT THE GAME<br /><br />Frostpunk is a blend of city-builder, society survival and a strategy game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive.<br />Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler's time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and the present state.<br />What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?",

Based on the 4th Edition of the game, this faithful adaptation allows you to re-experience this iconic game of gothic horror and deduction in a whole new way. If you've never played the original board game, you can see exactly why Fury of Dracula is considered a classic among the board game community!<br /><br />Will you take on the role of Dracula as he increases his influence over Europe? Or will you and up to three friends take on the role of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, Dr. John Seward, Lord Arthur Godalming, and Mina Harker as they attempt to stop him before his bloody plans bare fruit?<br /><br />With an emphasis on hidden movement and teamwork, the hunters have to coordinate their movements to close the net on Dracula. Dracula has a host of tricks and traps up his sleeves, to misdirect and hide from the hunters - but the hunters are armed with plenty of tools too!<br /><br />So… will you be the hunter or the hunted?",

There isn't anyone to pay for pensions due to those ungrateful millennials who prefer playing video games instead of doing actual work. With no one to cover your living costs, you - just like all other old people in this world - have no other choice but to survive on your own. <br />How will you survive in a world that wants you to Just Die Already?<br /><br />To make things worse, you've just been kicked out of your retirement home, and your only option now is to perform dangerous challenges and explore the world for retirement tickets to qualify for free retirement care. <br />So with society wishing you dead, isn't it finally time to live a little?<br /><br />FREE POST-LAUNCH PVP MODES – AVAILABLE NOW<br /><br />Give the boomers what they deserve by having them fight for their lives!

BREAK A NECK<br />Discover the joys of being old and made of glass, anything can break you and you can break your everything.<br /><br />DON'T TRY THIS AT (RETIREMENT) HOME<br />Complete dangerous challenges that you will never ever try at home and answer existential questions like: can you launch yourself from a catapult and land on someone? Or, can you survive losing your head, grabbing it and whacking someone with it?<br /><br />ONE MISSION: RETIRE!<br />Earn rewards by completing dangerous challenges, your goal? To qualify for a proper retirement home. That makes perfect sense. Word of advice: try and stay in one piece so you can enjoy it in the end…<br /><br />SANDBOX MULTIPLAYER<br />Play alone, or with up to 4 players in online multiplayer.

        "description": "Before he was the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock's quest for truth.<br /><br />As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.<br /><br />Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It's time to confront your past so you can become the legend you're destined to be.<br /><br />KEY PILLARS<br /><br />The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you'll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We've never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you're living it.<br /><br />Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace.<br /><br />And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there's something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean.<br /><br />A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really?<br /><br />A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult.<br /><br />Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It's up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you'll become.",

Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages.<br /><br />The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him – but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible.<br /><br />Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.<br /><br />As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them – and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.<br /><br />A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's atmosphere.",

Lack of resources, illnesses caused by polluted air and water, crime on the rise, war. Governments and companies promise remedies through technological progress. Drones and humanoid robots replace humans in the public sector, everything is interconnected, surveillance has become omnipresent.<br /><br />Richard Nolan is one of the few journalists openly criticizing this development. When he wakes up in hospital after an explosion and finds that his wife and son have mysteriously vanished, Richard realizes: he and his family have become more than just bystanders in a storm of rivaling ideas pertaining humankind's salvation between dystopian reality and digital utopia.

Hans walked into the forest in search of adventure. Soon it was night and the boy was really scared, so he tried to go back.

        "description": "The Escapists is an award winning prison break simulation that provides players the opportunity of experiencing a light-hearted insight into everyday prison life. Whilst the aim of the game is simply to escape, the detail is in the execution. (Don't say the word execution too loud in a prison). You may not be in an open prison, but you are in an open world where in between attending rollcalls, mealtimes and doing your chores you should grab every chance to plan your escape. Do you do favors for other inmates earning money and boosting their opinion of you along the way? Or workout and become stronger? Read to increase your skills or spend your time crafting items into homemade weapons and tools. What about working diligently in your prison job, to gain promotions to new jobs with better benefits? Keep a low profile or go out all guns blazing, as long as you escape in the end, that's all that matters.<br /><br />The Escapists developed by Mouldy Toof Studios & Team17 Digital  © 2015.

You play as “XIII”, a man without an identity, in a solo campaign with numerous twists and turns. Inspired by the eponymous graphic novel, the game features a completely reinvented and unique cel-shading design. In XIII, players can also take part in fierce multi-player fights.<br /><br />The country remains in a state of shock following the assassination of President Sheridan. You wake up, wounded and with amnesia, on a deserted beach on the east coast. The only clues as to your identity are a tattoo of the number XIII near your collarbone and a locker key. Even though your memory is failing, you discover that you have the reflexes of a highly trained professional fighter. You set off in search of your past, discovering that you played a role in the murder of the President of the United States of America, and revealing the most astounding conspiracy ever hatched in the country's history.<br /><br />- The remake of the 2003 cult FPS initially released on PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo Gamecube.<br />- A new artistic direction that respects the original work and its iconic cel-shading design.<br />- Numerous references to the eponymous graphic novel, with onomatopoeia, speech bubbles, panels and more.<br />- Music and voices from the original version.<br />- A conspiracy-based plot with numerous twists and turns.<br />- Varied gameplay with action, infiltration and exploration phases.<br />- A breathtaking solo campaign with 34 levels.<br />- A brutal arsenal of 15 weapons to get your memory back.<br />- Fierce multi-player fights.",

Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.<br /><br />Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It's time to confront your past so you can become the legend you're destined to be.<br /><br />KEY PILLARS<br /><br />The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you'll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We've never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you're living it.<br /><br />Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace.<br /><br />And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there's something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean.<br /><br />A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really?<br /><br />A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult.<br /><br />Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It's up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you'll become.",

About love as fuel, the force that drives us.<br /><br />Love is a universal feeling, but each of us experiences it in a different way. Solo – Islands of the Heart explores the theme of love in an introspective way, allowing players to identify and reflect on their own experiences.<br /><br />The world is divided into archipelagos, with each island representing a unique puzzle. Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.<br /><br />As with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island.<br /><br />Nature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.",

        "description": "theHunter: Call of the Wild Diamond Bundle lets you dive into a hunting experience like no other, containing the base game, 4 reserves, 3 weapon packs, 3 equipment packs and 2 trophy lodges. Plunge into an atmospheric open world, teeming with life: from the majestic true-to-life animals to the rustling of leaves above you as you stalk your prey. You can decide to hunt on your own or join up and hunt together with friends. Just remember, you are not just a visitor in this world, you are a living and breathing part of it. As you finally spot the majestic crown of your first red deer through the brush, the feeling is indescribable.<br /><br />EXPLORE RESERVES ACROSS THE WORLD<br />In the Diamond Bundle, you will be able to visit hunting grounds across the globe. Trek through the lavender fields of Parque Fernando, explore the lush snow covered landscape of Yukon Valley, traverse the regal foliage of Cuatro Colinas, or scale past the cloudline in the mountainous Silver Ridge Peaks. In these diverse reserves, you will be able to hunt animals of all shapes and sizes, from grizzly bears and wolves to turkeys, bighorn sheep, ibexes, and pumas. And that only scratches the surface of what these 4 regions have to offer.<br /><br />BRING THE PERFECT EQUIPMENT<br />When tracking your target, you need to bring the best possible equipment for the task, and Diamond Bundle has you covered. Including 5 weapon and equipment packs, you will be able to prepare yourself for any hunting situation. Bring the drilling rifle along for versatility, the MN1890 or M1 for reliability, or the Muzzleloader for that old-time explosive shot. Or if you want to set up the perfect hiding spot to take down your target, utilize the treestands and tripods for maximum visibility.<br /><br />SHOWCASING YOUR TROPHIES<br />What better way to celebrate a successful hunt than showcasing your trophies in one of the two lodges included in the Diamond Bundle. Decorate the walls and rooms in both the spacious 1800 British Mansion and more modern safari lodge with your prized kills, creating a visual representation and journey of your best hunting moments. Or simply use the multi trophy mounts to pose multiple animals and create a visually climactic moment involving your favourite trophies. Invite your friends to your lodge at any time and share your evolving collection.",

Hope is but a faded memory for all but one, a priestess named Kaho from the village of Lun. An audience with her majesty, the queen, would surely save the land--but time is short and each night darker than the last.<br /><br />Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a side-scrolling platformer focused on action gameplay, with melee combos, dodge mechanics and a plethora of items and spells to unleash upon your enemies. Play casually for the rich setting and mysterious story or crank up the difficulty to run your reflexes through a truly brutal gauntlet.",

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity's last line of defense.<br /><br />Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF. As their different experiences interweave with each other, it is only then that you will reveal the full story and unlock all the mysteries of a Brain Punk future caught between technology and psychic abilities in SCARLET NEXUS.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Having accepted a request from The Morning Bell newspaper to “uncover the mystery of a small English town”, Naomi finds herself far from her home in New York, in Rainy Woods. Upon beginning her investigation, Naomi – camera in hand – soon discovers an inexplicable phenomenon in which the townspeople transform into cats and dogs as night falls... Then, as just she's looking into that particular mystery, a murder occurs... Join her as she attempts to reveal the truth about Rainy Woods.<br /><br />■Solve mysteries as a human, a cat, or a dog!<br /><br />Naomi herself eventually becomes able to transform into a cat or dog. Turn into a cat, and gain the ability to jump and climb all over town to explore; or transform into a dog, and use your acute sense of smell to track the town's residents. Use your respective abilities as a human, cat, and dog wisely to more easily solve the various mysteries and incidents you'll face.<br /><br />■Take photos to earn money<br /><br />As a journalist, Naomi is able to earn money by taking photos of Rainy Woods at the request of The Morning Bell and the town's residents. Also, if she can manage to snap photos of whatever happens to be trending on social media site “Flamingo” and increase her number of followers, she just might be able to earn enough money to make life in this small town that much easier.<br /><br />■Enjoy life in your new town<br /><br />In Rainy Woods, as long as you've got the money, a free and easy life is yours to be enjoyed. Growing vegetables in your garden, brushing up on your culinary skills, exploring the plains, sharing a drink with your fellow townspeople at the local pub... Stay fed, get lots of sleep, keep yourself looking nice and clean, and enjoy daily life in Rainy Woods.<br /><br />■Explore the vast and sprawling town of Rainy Woods<br /><br />Rainy Woods is full of various spots, as well as an array of events just waiting to happen. Explore the areas around the town to unlock shrines and camping grounds, expand your field of mobility, and enjoy the comfortably open world. Hopping onto a sheep and riding around the hills is just so much fun!",

Will you whittle away at smaller and safer zones along the edge, or will you go for higher scores by cutting into enemy territory? Box in power-ups to use their effects, unlock completed images in the gallery and share your victories across online leaderboards!<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Rescue anime-style mecha girls in 50 unique stages!<br />• Decide your own strategy in freeform gameplay.<br />• Adapt to gradually increasing difficulty.<br />• Unlock special 5-star challenges with the girls in alternate outfits!<br />• View your captured images in Gallery mode.<br />• Enjoy a pumping soundtrack that will get you in the mood.<br />• Share high scores with online leaderboards!",

Will the Blood Maidens finally get their happily ever after?<br /><br />Jail - a living prison for humans, buried 666 meters underground. It appeared suddenly several decades ago, giving birth to monsters called Marchen and patrolled by madness-inducing Nightmares.<br /><br />A group of prisoners, Jack and the Blood Maidens, were reincarnations of fairy tales who dared to escape. They climbed from the bottom of the tower up to the surface, filled with hope...<br /><br />But outside were thousands of corpses soaking in a sea of blood. There stood beings known as Massacre Pink, smiling. In that moment, hope was destroyed. The group was torn asunder, with Jack and the Blood Maidens scattered to their own paths.<br /><br />Separated, they are each drawn to the devouring Jail that floats in the sky...<br />This is the finale to the tale of the Blood Maidens.",

Open chests to acquire swords, spears and staffs that can be set as primary or secondary weapons. Combine and synthesize more powerful items. Stack the deck in your favor before facing the monstrous bosses of each dungeon, from giant skeletons and minotaurs to dragons and even greater terrors!<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Explore more than 10 dungeon types, each with different levels of challenge!<br />• Customize your character's appearance, from hairstyle and color to the gear they use.<br />• Navigate side-scrolling stages with dynamic leaps, rolls and wall jumps!<br />• Gather loot to craft or upgrade your weapons and armor.<br />• Choose between alternate skills and buffs as you level up.<br />• Take down gigantic bosses guarding the deepest reaches of the Abyss Tower!<br /><br />This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.",
