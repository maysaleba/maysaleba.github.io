A thousand years later, the journey of one young man begins. ■Unique Battle System Battle commands for ever changing battle situations. The game introduces a symbol encounter system in which the battle starts by approaching enemies in the dungeon. Giving orders depending on situations according to the conditions of your allies and enemies is of vast importance. With the \"Morale\" system, which displays the strength and morale of each character during the fight, the outcome of the battle will greatly change. Increasing attack power or reducing damage taken will provide beneficial effects to the battle. Besides formations and critical triggers, there are also several other elements in the battle system for you to enjoy. ■Additional Features ・Trophy and share function ・High speed moving function for Rush (protagonist) on the field ・Adjusted texture resolution and lighting via an update ・Changed menu font and facial graphics Copyright: ©2008, 2018 SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD.

Take the role of gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd, and come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack reach his retirement with a nice stack of bills, or will he end up broken ... or worse? Manage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage. Choose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you\u2019ll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg\u2019s crime bosses. Sometimes you\u2019ll find yourself dodging questions in the press room, or even the occasional cross-examination in the witness box.

Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race. A new recovery mechanic Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating. The lower the rating, the more the recovery profile penalises the race-day condition.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-06","LowestPrice":"/game/109504","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/mDRlUb0UyukoAVgxgkjKZ1CF.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/EP6665-CUSA27349_00-TDF2100000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi76_U3Xegk","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Sports","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/mDRlUb0UyukoAVgxgkjKZ1CF.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/tour-de-france-2021","Title":"Tour de France 2021 PS4 (English)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-03","Slug":"tour-de-france-2021-ps4-english-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":308,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":61.6,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"59","SaleEnds":"2022-12-21","description":"Rebel Cops is a spin-off game from This Is the Police, which exclusively features the series' turned-based tactical operations.

Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating \u2013 the 1990s \u2013 Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. \"IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN\" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen\u2026 In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

In the far distant future, a psionic hormone was discovered in the human brain, granting people extra-sensory powers and changed the world as we knew it. As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity\u2019s last line of defense. Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF.

Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race. A new recovery mechanic Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating.

The more luck you have, the better chance you have that enemy bullets will miss, you get saved from a bad jump or better loot is dropped at your feet. But beware! When you don\u2019t have much luck built up in your special bracelet, bridges might collapse, rocks could tumble loose or outlaws might find a way to get the jump on you! Inspired by the unrealistically fast gunslingers, dark humor and greed-driven anti-heroes of spaghetti western classics, Luckslinger is an action-packed romp through the gritty frontier with a unique hip hop twist. Graffiti spraying, vinyl digging, slow drums and jazzy samples give this western a modern and slightly anachronistic flair all its own. The town of Clovercreek has been robbed blind! Six infamous criminals stole the town\u2019s precious luck charms and it\u2019s up to you to bring them back. You won\u2019t be alone, though.

During a weekend at a cabin, Ash uncovered the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (Book of the Dead) and awoke something dark in the woods. Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off. For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars. But he screwed up one night when he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once more. After a terrible fight, Ash, drawing his last breath, was taken by the Knights of Sumeria and transported into the future. But after his deal with a demon went South, Ash found himself in the realm of the Entity, without shotgun or chainsaw.

The story of Aya and Saki, two sisters bound by mutual hatred and locked in a brutal fight to the death, has been revived and reimagined. Main character designer Katsumi Enami breathes new life into the characters, making this silky-smooth 60fps high-speed action game an unmissable treat. All shall be revealed in this reimagined rerelease of the games that started it all in Onee Chanbara Origin! The Story In the year 20XX AD, Tokyo is nothing but a dystopic wasteland overrun by living corpses known as the Undead. Here we find two sisters who descend from a long line of expert swordsmen, yet were born to different mothers. The elder sister, Aya, was raised by her father, who subjected her to rigorous training in the way of the blade. Meanwhile, the younger sister, Saki, was raised by her mother, learning to despise her father for abandoning them and taking her sister away. When her father goes missing, Aya decides to put her skills with the sword to use as an Undead-hunter. Upon her beloved mother's murder, Saki becomes consumed to the point of insanity with a desperate thirst for revenge, resorting to manipulating the Undead to achieve her goal. Aya resolves to seek out her younger sister, her only surviving relation, while Saki is determined to resurrect her mother using an ancient art passed down through the ages. This art, however, requires the heart of a blood relative to work, meaning that the younger sister must kill the elder if she is to have her sworn vengeance. And so, amidst a swirling storm of love, hate, and intrigue, the battle between the two sisters begins.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-06","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/1212/JL1dPZD2SerLAl8ZWBRBdaBi.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/HP5846-CUSA19217_00-ANEZ3GAMEDX00000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":174.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/1212/JL1dPZD2SerLAl8ZWBRBdaBi.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"OneeChanbara ORIGIN Deluxe Edition (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"CLOUDED LEOPARD ENTERTAINMENT INC.","ReleaseDate":"2020-09-24","Slug":"oneechanbara-origin-deluxe-edition-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":581,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":174.3,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-12-21","description":"The world of WWE is your battleground with all-new, over the top, in-your-face arcade action as your favorite WWE Superstars and Legends battle it out in outlandish environments with an arsenal of moves, special abilities, and power-ups.
