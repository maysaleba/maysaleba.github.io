Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community. Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes\", which were originally published separately, available now on Nintendo Switch™ for the first time. Also for the first time, it has been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_KentuckyRouteZeroTvEdition_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0_n9QPves4","PeruPrice":"40","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Adventure,Indie","ArgentinaPrice":"1199.99","AustraliaPrice":"19.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_KentuckyRouteZeroTvEdition.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"40000","SouthafricaPrice":"209.95","BrazilPrice":"59.99","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Annapurna Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2020-01-28","Slug":"kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"49.99","ChilePrice":"8000","Price":"24.99","MexicoPrice":"279.99","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"14.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"10.70","SCORE":"86","SaleEnds":"2022-05-26","LowestPrice":"8.49","SaleStarted":"2022-05-12","description":"Underhero is an RPG-platformer where the chosen hero has failed, and an underling of the evil king reluctantly takes his place as the new hero.

Play as a detective and investigate the murder by shapeshifting into any character. Even the next victim. Dorota Shaw is dead. And the prime suspects are three tarot readers with the uncanny ability to predict murder - or commit it. It\u2019s your job to find out what else they know - but they won\u2019t reveal their dark secrets to just anyone\u2026 Luckily, you can be anyone you want to be. The game features more than 1600 full HD video responses, a simple questioning interface with unique \u2018delete\u2019 mechanic, and a randomly chosen murderer at the start of the game. Developed by the World Record-breaking makers of \"The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker\". ● Shapeshift - into nine other characters so you can investigate and manipulate relationships from all angles, and unlock the other half of the story. ● Suspense - solve a murder, stop a murder, don\u2019t get caught. Any one of three random murderers helps to minimize spoilers. ● Choices matter - catch the killer, save the victims, make and break relationships \u2013 or don\u2019t. ● Problem solving - can\u2019t get that vital clue yourself? Try shapeshifting into the Police Chief. Think the dialogue options are a trap? Delete them. ● 100% FMV - an entire game of smooth FMV cutscenes and responses in first person perspective. ● Catalytic events - not all branching is binary.

The mission is no longer just discovery, but to survive the journey with those still left alive. Tharsis is built around a unique mix of a board game and video game mechanics.

There\u2019s all this, plus over 30 historical airplanes at their disposal: from classic fighters to light and heavy bombers which they can fly, repaint, customize, and upgrade.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"8.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"109","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.65","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-27","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-05-06","description":"Are you ready for the 250 Sit-Ups Challenge?

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia. Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs.

Guide the Moorhuhn through the jungle in his first jump and run platformer for Nintendo Switch™! The Quest for the WHATSIT An amulet lost 1000 years ago, the WHATSIT, has always been the Holy Grail of treasure hunters. Well, actually the Holy Grail is the treasure hunters' Holy Grail, but the WHATSIT comes right after it. And even Moorhuhn, the greatest adventurer among treasure hunters, cannot resist a hint as to the whereabouts of this relic. And so, he unceremoniously drops himself above the dense jungle and plunges headlong into the adventure. In the depths of the dense jungle, the Moorhuhn follows the legend of an ancient, lost temple complex. Legendary treasures are said to lie hidden there, but above all a priceless treasure: the sacred amulet of WHATSIT! Hidden traps, bad-tempered gorillas, aggressive crocodiles, strange shamans, forest spirits, temple guards, bats, warriors of the dead and stranded aliens require all the courage and skill of a real treasure hunter. As you would expect from a proper jump and run platformer, you need to use all your physical strength, courage, and skill.

The World Large, procedurally generated and interconnected lands range from plains, to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area\u2019s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items.

Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay You need to conquer a big portion of the initial area that you start the level. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield empties. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and required conquered area percentage for the victory. What happens when you pass a level? You see the related girl's photo and can continue with her story or unlock the next girl. How many girls and bosses? 8 girls, 24 bosses, 24 minions, 24 levels, 8 mega levels, 4 traps, 4 power-ups, and 2 towers! Evil towers of course. Each boss and his minions were uniquely designed.
