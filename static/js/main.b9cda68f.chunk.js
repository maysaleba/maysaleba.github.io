In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets.

Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\'ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal.

The decisive last stand is coming. A final attempt to set things right before mankind goes over the edge of extinction.<br /><br />As the most advanced blade fighter ever created, you\'re always outnumbered but never outclassed.

Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.<br /><br />The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.<br /><br />What\'s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\'ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.<br /><br />They don\'t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\'ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\'t happen but marketing text is hard to write.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Team Meat LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-19","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/1209/bhgDakvgeEnnYx3kinsfd3cw.png?w=200","Slug":"super-meat-boy-forever-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1055-CUSA16602_00-SUPERMEATBOYFORE","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKjjyDUgGd8","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"45%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Action,Platformer","SalePrice":10.99,"PlusPrice":10.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"73","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/113866/moving-out-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-07-07 06:59:00","Title":"Moving Out","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-06-22 08:11:29","description":"Moving Out is a ridiculous physics-based moving simulator that brings new meaning to \'couch co-op\'!<br /><br />Are you ready for an exciting career in furniture?

Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don\'t stay in too long or your swim could become your last.<br /><br />Explore, Craft, and Survive<br />-------------------------------<br />You\'ll arrive on a frozen island with only the clothes on your back -- it\'s up to you to survive. Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn\'t the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait.<br /><br />Make Your Path<br />-------------------------------<br />Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course.<br /><br />Unravel the Mystery<br />-------------------------------<br />Why won\'t the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to.<br /><br />A Beautifully Frigid World<br />-------------------------------<br />Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog. The remnants of an ancient civilization lie before you, but don\'t let awe turn into carelessness -- snow storms can crop up at any moment and bury you in a blizzard. Luckily, you can leave footprints in the snow and follow your footsteps back if you are lost.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"No Matter Studios LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-12-14","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png?w=200","Slug":"praey-for-the-gods-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1880-PPSA02131_00-3768321134104813","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzDl2THyF4w","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"PercentOff":"50%","Price":29.99,"genre":"","SalePrice":14.99,"PlusPrice":14.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"70","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/29137/senko-no-ronde-2-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-07-07 06:59:00","Title":"Senko no Ronde 2","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-06-22 08:12:41","description":"Originally released in Japanese arcades in 2005, the Senko no Ronde series provides an unique mix of both the shooting and fighting genres, mixing them into a one-on-one action game where two Rounder (mecha) pilots face off against one another in a veritable ballet of bullets and battling.

It\'s been months since you last saw Theo, and she\'s incredibly excited to spend the weekend together.<br /><br />She invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation to your friend Alec.

According to her online bio, in her spare time she enjoys hiking and playing piano.<br /><br />Alec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both have similar hobbies like gaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally, renting a student house with Alec seemed like a great idea... until he started dating. He jumps from girl to girl, never committing despite constantly whining that he wants a serious relationship. His latest date, Erika, tagged along to the cottage without an invitation. Lately, Alec has been annoying you... more than usual.<br /><br />A year younger than you, Erika is from the same hometown.

It is a celebration of ancient China\'s landscape, civilization and culture, infused with the mystique of its own legends in stark contrast to anachronistic technological designs. It is a world that is both familiar and mysterious, one of both science and spirituality, one that is waiting to be explored.<br /><br />Take the role of the calm and reliable swordsman Taishi Zhao as he fights to protect his family and uncover the truth of a blight threatens all of China. With a story deeply rooted in ancient Chinese history and mythology, Xuan Yuan Sword 7 reimagines both as one fantastical and chaotic realm under the governance of a new Xin Dynasty.<br /><br />Near the end of Western Han rule, the powerful prime minister of China superseded his Emperor, promising an era of peace and prosperity.
