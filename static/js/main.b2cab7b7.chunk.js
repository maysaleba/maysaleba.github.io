Maintain what remains of their health and sanity as they are strained by a crumbling ship, lack of food and the strange and disturbing signals coming from the Red Planet. Succeeding in Tharsis requires you to make the best of what you have, even if everything indicates failure. Certain factors may be outside of your control, but that doesn\'t mean they can\'t be overcome. Be ready to plan and adapt continually. The game offers three levels of difficulty - easy for a fair learning curve, normal for those wanting a tough but fair challenge and hard for the true challenge seekers. Defy the odds, make the difficult decisions, and embark on a harrowing mission of survival and fate. Features: - Turn-based space survival strategy game.

Fight countless enemies with a huge selection of gun turrets (in the form of comic heroes) and additional helpers (mines, air support, block wall) on more than 60 maps. Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions.

It\'s like a human\'s essence that can\u2019t be measured by a staged photo. And thus Glittering Sword is not that kind of game that some may think judging by screenshots or trailer. On the first glance it looks like typical action-adventure, like many other classic titles from the 90\'s. Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it\u2019s shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: \xabfantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles\xbb. Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher. We hope that players who are addicted to adventure games will fall in love with this small but very entertaining game.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_GlitteringSword_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/glittering-sword-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"0","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"3","genre":"Puzzle,Action","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"3.75","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_GlitteringSword.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"45","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Glittering Sword","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"ChiliDog Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-05","Slug":"glittering-sword-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"10","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"55.39","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"2.49"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.19","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-05","LowestPrice":"2.59","SaleStarted":"2022-04-14","description":"When you\'re fighting, be sure to Go All Out!

Whatever you choose, make sure to excel, gather reputation points for your actions, and obtain access to the most challenging and best-paid missions.

All can be built according to your needs and customized to reflect your play style. Making the right choices will be crucial to ensuring the success of your missions.

Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay You need to conquer a big portion of the initial area that you start the level. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield empties. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and required conquered area percentage for the victory. What happens when you pass a level? You see the related girl\'s photo and can continue with her story or unlock the next girl.

Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley\'s Mecha-suit, which she calls \\"Mr. Riggs\\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.<br />CAMPAIGN<br />Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet.

It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission.<br />EXPLORATION<br />Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology.<br />CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY<br />The Riftbreaker\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings.

In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming 8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he takes on hordes of zombies let loose upon the world.<br /><br />Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne.  Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.<br /><br />Protect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic\'s epic story.<br /><br />The Escapists. \xa9 2015.
