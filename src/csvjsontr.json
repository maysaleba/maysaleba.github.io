In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating.

THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you\u2019re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you\u2019re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you\u2019ll discover choices in this world aren\u2019t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment \u2013 the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small \u2013 like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction \u2013 but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don\u2019t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society\u2019s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.","SaleStarted":"2023-01-31","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipHHGDDhm9Q","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":"","genre":"Strategy, Simulation, Strategy","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/frostpunk-console-edition","Title":"Frostpunk: Console Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"11 Bit Studios S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2019-10-10","Slug":"frostpunk-console-edition-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":259,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":64.75,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"87","SaleEnds":"2023-02-15","description":"Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment trying to figure out what's happening on a sprawling, ever-changing and seemingly cursed Island.

Assume the leadership of a medieval noble family, increasing its power and reputation through the generations. As one ruler dies, they are replaced by an heir who may have very different abilities or interests, forcing you to adjust your long term plans. Play a master of the battlefield, conquering your enemies, or play a subtle seeker of secrets, using plots and poison to advance your agenda - all in the same game. Arrange marriages, champion the faith and establish new empires in this modern classic - unlike any other strategy game you\u2019ve ever played on console. HISTORY Choose a royal or noble house from a number of realms on a map that stretches from Iceland to India, from the Arctic Circle to Central Africa. Guide a dynasty through the centuries, ensuring the security and power of each new generation. Gather new lands and titles to cement your legacy. Be a pious king to bring the religious powers to your side, or strike out on your own, designing your own splinter religion and earning everlasting fame or eternal damnation. Knights, peasant revolts, pilgrimages, Viking raiders... experience the drama and pageantry of the Middle Ages! CHARACTER Adopt one of five different lifestyles, perfecting your skills in military strategy or kingdom management. Acquire character traits that will guide your actions, but beware if you act against your nature! The stress from denying your truest self could bring a new host of troubles! Choose appropriate guardians for your heirs, or train them yourself. But what do you do if the legal heir is not quite up to the job? Violent characters may develop a fearsome reputation, cowering your timid subjects into obedience with the dread you inspire. WARFARE Recruit men-at-arms units and powerful knights to supplement your royal levies. Research new technologies to increase the wealth and military might of your realm. Hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major wars. Supplement your income with ransomed prisoners or raiding parties on neighboring realms. INTRIGUE Use your spymaster to discover plots against your dynasty and your rule. Recruit agents to assist your schemes to undermine or murder anyone who stands between you and power. Seduce other characters for love or political power. Gather information for blackmailing purposes or call in favors whenever your plans need an extra bit of influence.","SaleStarted":"2023-01-31","LowestPrice":"/game/71763","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/1607/czGau6hOvx9iQYOOkACdxqDl.png?w=200","MainStory":69,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4139-PPSA02308_00-TTL0000000000002","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8N_6xtr0Q","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":715,"genre":"Strategy, Simulation","PlusPrice":999999,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/1607/czGau6hOvx9iQYOOkACdxqDl.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/crusader-kings-iii","Title":"Crusader Kings III","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PARADOX INTERACTIVE AB","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-29","Slug":"crusader-kings-iii-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":439,"MainExtra":170,"SalePrice":329.25,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"85","SaleEnds":"2023-02-15","description":"If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

Chime Sharp is an sequel to 2009's Chime, a music puzzle game with an addictive, ambient heartbeat. You tessellate shapes to cover a grid, while a beatline reads those shapes as notes. As you cover the board the music builds to a beautiful crescendo of your own design. The only way to discover Chime is to play it, but if you want a glimpse, consider what it might feel like to cross Tetris, a music sequencer and a hypnotic dream about your favourite pop song. Chime Sharp takes Chime's classic dynamic and updates it for 2017. The core rules are the same but the aesthetic is clean and modern and the game's soundtrack has been completely refreshed. With sixteen new levels, experimental modes, new-era connectivity and sharper ways to play, Chime's finally back -- and it wants to be your new favourite mixtape.

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. The game centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It\u2019s a shockingly enjoyable sci-fi action running game where the player uses techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts. As well as these evasive elements there\u2019s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action bundle and with it re-invents the running game genre.

The Shadowrun Trilogy comprises 3 cult tactical RPG games taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which magic has re-awakened, bringing back to life creatures of high fantasy. Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades. Shadowrun Returns The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Nearly 10 years ago, creator Jordan Weisman returned to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city\u2019s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It\u2019s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge\u2019s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the \u201cFlux State\u201d controls the city of Berlin. It\u2019s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there\u2019s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return\u2026 Shadowrun Hong Kong - Extended Edition HONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. As an ex-con living in Seattle, you try to make an honest living but when your foster begs you to meet him in China, things turn grim and you find out the police are trying to arrest you. And by arrest, they mean to kill you on sight! Build your team of Shadowrunners, mercenaries with big personalities who can fight using mystical or technical powers, and turn the tables on the elite corporate and the police.

Get a babysitter for the kids, this game is a madcap, mile-a-minute spree of spies, dives, and gun-toting bad guys that will have you on the edge of your seat. You take on the role of Jack, a handsome, jaded former intelligence officer pulled out of his retired life as a strip club regular for one last mission to stop the villainous virologist Krueger, who plans to unleash a mind-controlling virus on the unsuspecting citizens of L.A. Everyone is out to kill Jack now that he\u2019s hot on Krueger\u2019s trail, and he\u2019ll need to use his mind, muscles, and mojo to stay alive long enough to stop Kruger\u2019s plot. Your spur-of-the-moment decisions will help or hinder Jack as he tries to find and protect the only scientist who has the cure to counter Krueger\u2019s deadly bioweapon. A restoration and remaster of a game lost to time for over 25 years, American Hero was originally designed for the Atari Jaguar CD as a \u201cplayable movie\u201d with a groundbreaking, more fluid presentation than the FMV games of its time. The game features the talents of professional actors, including Timothy Bottoms (The Last Picture Show, Johnny Got His Gun), Daniel Roebuck (The Fugitive, Final Destination), and Musetta Vander (O Brother, Where Art Thou, Wild Wild West). For this restoration, Timothy Bottoms reprises his role in newly recorded voiceovers of Jack\u2019s inner thoughts heard throughout the game. This restoration was rebuilt from the ground up with new game logic that delivers on the ambitious promise of the original game. This edition of the game includes new voicework from star Timothy Bottoms to accompany the original footage, completing the American Hero experience for the first time.

Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive? If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode! Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play. You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type. The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it.

Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that \u201cEl Hijo\u201d must traverse to reach his ultimate goal. - Survive the Wild West through the cleverness of a young hero - Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world - Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless - Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles - Use an arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes - Inspire other children to join you on the path to freedom - Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother","SaleStarted":"2023-01-31","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/WYjKQ407XRGoyRypUoBZTrPI.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4539-CUSA17029_00-BASEGAME00000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFAcJW-05Hg","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":"","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/WYjKQ407XRGoyRypUoBZTrPI.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"El Hijo - A Wild West Tale","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"www.handy-games.com GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-25","Slug":"el-hijo--a-wild-west-tale-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":189,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":122.85,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-02-15","description":"In this supreme Hunt: Showdown - Deluxe Edition you will receive the base game and 4 DLCs! - Hunt Showdown (base game) - Last Gust (one weapon) - Llorona\u2019s Heir (one hunter) - Legends of the Bayou (two hunters, two weapons, 500 Blood Bonds) - The Phantom (one hunter)","SaleStarted":"2023-01-31","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202103/1808/E7meDFtmNQzr0dZfbnEQrUOD.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-DELUXEEDITION000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":149.7,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202103/1808/E7meDFtmNQzr0dZfbnEQrUOD.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Hunt: Showdown \u2013 Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Crytek Gmbh","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-22","Slug":"hunt-showdown--deluxe-edition-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":499,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":149.7,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-02-15","description":"The Hunt: Showdown Gold Edition bundle contains the Main game and 7 DLC packs: - Hunt: Showdown (base game) - Legends of the Bayou (two hunters, two weapons, 500 Blood Bonds) - Llorona\u2019s Heir (one hunter) - The Phantom (one hunter) - Last Gust (one weapon) - Zhong Kui (two hunters) - Louisiana Legacy (two weapons) - Crossroads (four weapons) - Trick Shooter (one hunter, two weapons)","SaleStarted":"2023-01-31","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202103/1808/7dTwtnlihz9DWdeYuQtO3CEA.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-GOLDEDITION00000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":174.75,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202103/1808/7dTwtnlihz9DWdeYuQtO3CEA.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Hunt: Showdown \u2013 Gold Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Crytek Gmbh","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-22","Slug":"hunt-showdown--gold-edition-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":699,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":174.75,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-02-15","description":"This product is for users who own the DOOM Eternal Standard Edition or DOOM Eternal: The Ancient Gods - Part One.

Guide your agency through the space race and write your alternate history of space travel - any of the agencies can be the first to land on The Moon if you make the right choices. Manage the numerous challenges faced then and now: \u2022 Create your base with launch pads, research labs, astronaut training facilities, and much more \u2022 Construct your own custom vehicles from hundreds of combinations \u2022 Launch satellites and crewed spacecraft to explore the Solar System \u2022 Run mission control as you solve the various challenges of turn-based missions to earn scientific advancement and public support \u2022 Explore an extensive tech tree and compete or collaborate with other agencies to plot your roadmap to Mars \u2022 Choose from five unique space agencies, each with their own traits, base, vehicles, and spacecraft \u2022 Create your own custom space agency You\u2019re in charge of every element of the journey into space: success rides on your decisions. Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet? Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies? Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars. Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors. Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment. These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue? Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We\u2019ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.","SaleStarted":"2023-01-31","LowestPrice":"/game/85154","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png?w=200","MainStory":12,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5277-CUSA18418_00-0000000000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gqbz8C8bX0","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":117,"genre":"Strategy","PlusPrice":56.76,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Mars Horizon","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"THE IRREGULAR CORPORATION LTD.","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-17","Slug":"mars-horizon-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":172,"MainExtra":37,"SalePrice":56.76,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-02-15","description":"Previous special offer price valid from 21-12-2022 to 06-01-2023 was (£25.99 / \u20ac29.99 / AU $43.98 / BGN 59.99 / CZK 819.6 / DKK 239.6 / HUF 10276 / NZ $47.98 / NOK 319.6 / PLN 135.6 / SEK 319.6 / USD $27.99 / ZAR 519.6 / HRK 219.6 / INR 1900 / TRY 267.6 / ILS 142) Buy this digital PS5™ version of Call of Duty®: Black Ops Cold War from the Playstation®Store and download the PS4™ version at no extra cost.

WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression.

As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity.

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before! NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games.

You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!

Like the games that inspired it, Petal Crash features a variety of single player challenges in addition to an intense head-to-head versus mode. The rules are simple - push a block in any direction, and it'll keep going until it hits a wall or another block. If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage! Enter the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire. Eons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia. Each of them has their own wish, and their own story to tell. Challenge the Story Mode to take your chosen character through their tale, challenging all the others in fierce puzzle battles to assemble all seven Sacred Blossoms! Shoot for high scores in Solo Play, racing the clock or rationing limited moves to get the highest rank you can!
