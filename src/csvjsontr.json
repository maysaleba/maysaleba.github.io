You are a sleeper, a digitised human consciousness in an artificial body, owned by a corporation that wants you back. Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle. COMPLETE. EXPANDED. The PlayStation® version of Citizen Sleeper includes the complete post-launch three episode sequence, which expands the lore of the game, and introduces additional characters and locations to Erlin\u2019s Eye in an exciting late game storyline. ROLL THE DICE. DO THE WORK. GET PAID. SURVIVE. Inspired by Tabletop Roleplaying games, Citizen Sleeper uses Dice, Clocks and Drives to create a player-led experience, where you choose your path in a rich and responsive world. Each cycle you use the dice you are dealt to choose what to do with your time. Make or break alliances, uncover truths and escape your hunters. Survive and ultimately thrive, one cycle at a time, and sometimes against the clock! TURN UP FOR YOUR FRIENDS The station plays host to characters from all walks of life, trying to eke out an existence among the stars. Salvagers, engineers, hackers, bartenders, street-food vendors, each has a history which brought them here. You choose which of them you wish to help, and together you will shape your future. ACCESS THEIR SECRETS Eventually, you will learn to use your dice to hack into the station\u2019s cloud to access decades of digital data, uncover new areas and unlock secrets. This is your unique power, and with it you can change your future. Corporate secrets, rogue AIs and troves of lost data await those willing to dive into the depths of the station\u2019s networks. YOU WERE MADE TO DIE Essen-Arp: to them you are just property, one more asset in a portfolio that stretches across the stars. You are the product of an abusive system, in a universe where humanity\u2019s expansion is marked by exploitation and extraction. Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/94117","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1609/e3278cdeab2b05d0b0ff86c29c14f8b48ea0ada641ca1595.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5661-PPSA13629_00-CITIZENSLEEPER00","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWALcEDTL8U","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":11,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":159.2,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1609/e3278cdeab2b05d0b0ff86c29c14f8b48ea0ada641ca1595.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/citizen-sleeper","Title":"Citizen Sleeper","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SURPRISE ATTACK PTY LTD T/A FELLOW TRAVELLER GAMES","ReleaseDate":"2023-03-31","Slug":"citizen-sleeper-ps4&ps5-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/8KMw6qkupt","IsPS5":1,"Price":199,"MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":159.2,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"83","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Hike, climb, and soar through the peaceful mountainside landscapes of Hawk Peak Provincial Park.

The story takes place in the land of Rin during the height of the Age of Sail, following the events that would lead to the greatest war in human history. STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin. POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history. CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle. PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total. This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/103890","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png?w=200","MainStory":29,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3919-CUSA28518_00-R3PEU00000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8e4bk3jh0U","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":34,"genre":"Adventure, Role Playing Games","PlusPrice":233.35,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/rise-of-the-third-power","Title":"Rise of the Third Power","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2022-02-09","Slug":"rise-of-the-third-power-ps4-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/1fq2E1Gz32","IsPS5":0,"Price":359,"MainExtra":32,"SalePrice":233.35,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"79","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling is an adventure-RPG following three heroes, Vi, Kabbu, and Leif, as they embark on an epic quest in Bugaria in search of The Everlasting Sapling, a treasure that can grant immortality!

I'm waiting for you Miyamoto Musashi!\u201d There is no doubt for Musashi that the voice was the Sasaki Kojirō\u2019s one.

The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back...

Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.

Inspired by the two year struggle for control of the Isonzo river valley and the Alps during World War One, Isonzo elevates the WW1 Games Series, figuratively and literally. Take part in historical offensives from the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo to the Strafexpedition. Reflecting the course of the actual battles, as the attackers advance the fighting will shift through vastly different landscapes within a single offensive: from hillside fortresses to mountain trenches and fierce urban combat on city streets. Everything is recreated based on research and field trips, from sound effects and uniforms down to the houses, vineyards and trenches you\u2019ll be fighting over. The new Offensive game mode puts you right in the middle of key historical offensives on the Italian Front. Lead the charge across stunning Italian landscapes as you choose your path to victory - cut paths through barbed wire, flank your enemies by following mountain trails, or man a mortar to blast a way through. Shape a dynamic battlefield by laying sandbags and wire, placing ammo crates, deploying trench periscopes or sniper shields, and more. Call in support with a unique historically accurate flare system: flare guns can mark targets for artillery or biplane flybys, or different colored flares can be used to guide your team. Once the big guns have softened up the enemy, finish the job at close quarters with an Arditi dagger or mountaineer\u2019s pickaxe. Man heavy machine guns, mortars and even mountain guns for more direct fire support. Choose from six classes based on historical combat roles and build your loadout from a selection of weapons, equipment and perks linked to that class, giving flexibility and variety while staying grounded in what real soldiers might have carried. You\u2019ll be operating wire cutters, bandaging yourself and wounded teammates, and blowing the whistle to start an assault. One shot can kill and even lighter injuries can lead to quickly bleeding out. Being an effective soldier in Isonzo is not just about being a good marksman. Mastering the terrain is also key - the mountain can be a friend or foe. Learn how to navigate well to maintain cover and surprise your enemies or support your allies. Finally\u2026 watch out for the dreaded poison gas. You\u2019ve never experienced WW1 action quite like this! Key features: \u2022 MOUNTAIN WARFARE: Assaulting mountain fortifications, battling through ruined towns, and fording rivers are just a few of the challenges you\u2019ll face as you fight your way through numerous enemy positions \u2022 TACTICAL MULTIPLAYER FPS: Choose your role and loadout carefully to survive this high altitude combat - play a sniper to pick off the enemy engineers before they can cut your wire, use rifle grenades to clear enemy machine guns, and much more \u2022 WORLD WAR ONE GAMEPLAY: Historical Offensive game mode based on real battles and focused on the unique challenges of Alpine warfare. Fight with 30+ WW1 weapons, poisonous gas attacks, and intense artillery barrages \u2022 BUILD FOR VICTORY: Place your own wire, sandbags, trench periscopes, and more! Whether you\u2019re digging in or on the attack, shaping the battlefield to your advantage will be key to victory \u2022 FACES OF WAR: Make every class your own by picking from a variety of historically class-appropriate uniforms, accessories and headgear. As a finishing touch, you can even pick your mustache from several famous period-accurate styles! \u2022 AUTHENTIC WW1 ATMOSPHERE: Accuracy in everything from maps and weaponry to music and the uniforms \u2013 fight for the Kingdom of Italy, the German Empire or the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/100042","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0110/3357ff8a1bc7f241723880484bb36e97a26b8e3adfbf20f5.png?w=200","MainStory":14,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1662-PPSA03556_00-0215549468794198","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhPPeJi4ehE","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":115,"genre":"Action, Shooter, Strategy","PlusPrice":274.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0110/3357ff8a1bc7f241723880484bb36e97a26b8e3adfbf20f5.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/isonzo","Title":"Isonzo","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BlackMill Games B.V.","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-20","Slug":"isonzo-ps4&ps5-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/7AAykTTGVN","IsPS5":1,"Price":549,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":274.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"67","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Slash your way through a futuristic Earth overrun with ruthless mutants and powerful robots as Age, a young soldier sent on a mission to prevent the destruction of humankind.

The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man\u2019s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn\u2019t for the faint hearted! Looking for more WW1 action?

Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to. Scale Massive Beasts ------------------------------- Overcome impossible odds to climb atop and defeat the massive beasts that are bound to this land. Climb, Glide, Swim ------------------------------- You can climb on virtually anything you can get your hands on, from ruins and mountains to the massive beasts that inhabit the land. Ascend to the tops of mountains and then glide over the open world to reach previously inaccessible locations. Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don't stay in too long or your swim could become your last. Explore, Craft, and Survive ------------------------------- You'll arrive on a frozen island with only the clothes on your back -- it's up to you to survive. Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn't the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait. Make Your Path ------------------------------- Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course. Unravel the Mystery ------------------------------- Why won't the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to. A Beautifully Frigid World ------------------------------- Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog. The remnants of an ancient civilization lie before you, but don't let awe turn into carelessness -- snow storms can crop up at any moment and bury you in a blizzard. Luckily, you can leave footprints in the snow and follow your footsteps back if you are lost.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/64731","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1863-PPSA02191_00-0442182297085207","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzDl2THyF4w","PercentOff":"35%","Completionist":18,"genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":171,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/0600/EZhDfy3CiiHoXHcAC319ziJF.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/praey-for-the-gods","Title":"PRAEY FOR THE GODS","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"No Matter Studios LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-12-14","Slug":"praey-for-the-gods-ps4&ps5-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/30LPocUgQV","IsPS5":1,"Price":285,"MainExtra":12,"SalePrice":185.25,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"45","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Riddle me this: what sumo, walls and dancing have in common?

You will die, but you will not fail! Iron Danger is set in a world of lofty fells, primeval forest, and placid lakes...as well as living gods and monsters of steel.

If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"Contraptions\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style. Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels. Features + Solve over 200 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds. + Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it. + Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs. + Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like. Gameplay On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. When the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again. Gadgets Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car. Objectives There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc. The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/1409/d420f69e4c70a643d3d47533dee33229f71a0db22c22613c.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4358-CUSA43722_00-CONTRAPTIONS3EUR","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Puzzle","PlusPrice":31.25,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/1409/d420f69e4c70a643d3d47533dee33229f71a0db22c22613c.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Contraptions 3","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FUNBOX MEDIA LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2023-07-20","Slug":"contraptions-3-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":125,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":37.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Make sweet ice cream, popsicles and waffles using your creativeness in one of the best dessert decorating games right now.

It\u2019s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance. Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection! Dogs need a place to call home, and it\u2019s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you\u2019d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most! The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects. Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it\u2019s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that\u2019s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space.

You live and learn: surround yourself with other turnips and interact with them to forge your personality. Your acquired strengths and weaknesses will affect your future interactions. Build your social circle by maintaining and caring for the relationships that matter the most to you, and run away from the ones that don't. You can adopt many radish-pets and spend your life with them, start a family and breed little turnips or live fast and die young. There are thousands of ways to live and none is correct! Just live as you wish! (and assume the consequences of your decisions when you rot). Living and thriving in social relationships is not easy, so Minabo - A walk through life offers collectible hats that produce different effects when worn. Easily falling in love, making everyone hate you, getting an elegance plus or even changing your life expectancy... In Minabo - A walk through life, no two lives are the same and when they end, every one of them will generate a summary that you can share with your friends. What would you change from your past? What would life have been if you weren't rude to that one friend of your childhood? What if you spent more time with your family?

If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"Contraptions\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style. Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels. Features + Solve over 200 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds. + Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it. + Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs. + Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like. Gameplay On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters. This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects. When the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out. If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again. Gadgets Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car. Objectives There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc. The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1611/903ac3051a1c8b056dfb990b0e323721f39ab8674bbbc7c9.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4358-CUSA40925_00-CONTRAPTIONS2EUR","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Puzzle","PlusPrice":17.25,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1611/903ac3051a1c8b056dfb990b0e323721f39ab8674bbbc7c9.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Contraptions 2","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FUNBOX MEDIA LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2023-04-05","Slug":"contraptions-2-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":69,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":20.7,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Inspired by Jorge Luis Borges\u2019 short story of the same name, The Library of Babel invites you to a world 20,000 years after the extinction of humanity.

Every journey changes the point of view \u2013 it grows with the traveller. Our game tells a story about self-exploration, transformation and understanding the world around us. The plot of the game is inspired by real events, when people began their conquest of space by sending animals to the stars. We intended it to be a kind of a tribute to all the animals that paved the way for humans to go into space. Most of these animals - the first astronauts, did not survive the journey. Our story tells of the adventures of a dog named Bea, who... managed to beat the odds. Bea is a cheerful and courageous character, but the player must remember that she is just a... dog. She has all the characteristics of a mongrel - she barks, likes to chase her own tail, and learns about the world through her senses. Bea can sniff, listen and observe. These are the main mechanics of detective mode which will help her in exploring and understanding her environment. Bea travels through space discovering more planets. Each planet is different and has its specific inhabitants, who can either become friends of the main character or be very unfriendly towards her. We are convinced that exploring this amazing world together with Bea will give the player a lot of satisfaction and pleasure. Key Features: - Become an astronaut dog and experience an extraordinary space adventure - Follow your canine senses to traverse expansive levels and discover secrets hidden on wondrous planets - Communicate with extraterrestrials using a unique \u201cdialogue system\u201d relying solely on the dog\u2019s body language: jump, wag your tail, bark, growl, etc. - Enlist the help of the space companions you meet along the way \u2013 a comet and a robot \u2013 and acquire new skills like double-jump and telekinesis to move heavy objects - Solve unusual and sophisticated logic puzzles - Test your agility by overcoming the dangers lurking on alien planets - Explore the intriguing and thought-provoking story of the universe - Immerse yourself in the stirring original soundtrack - Find the way home","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0213/xi5gwuEyxr6b5mldrheVOiaQ.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7831-CUSA40607_00-0621503480157122","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":108.15,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0213/xi5gwuEyxr6b5mldrheVOiaQ.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Space Tail: Every Journey Leads Home Ultimate Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Longterm Games S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2023-03-08","Slug":"space-tail-every-journey-leads-home-ultimate-edition-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":309,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":123.6,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"How far would you go to find your daughter if she never came home?

Of course, players will have to defeat some of the most fearful foes first to bring her back to the Kingdom. But don't forget - it's dangerous to go alone! So players will be able to recruit a second Brave in the Tavern every time they embark on their new journey. The game will introduce new Braves as the adventure progresses. Explorer Evra, Lord Don Qui, Protector Sancho...and many more! Always create a duo in order to advance further. Construct strategies and find synergies, double the builds and quadruple the fun! It's Dangerous to Go Alone! Players will be able to recruit a second Brave in the Tavern every time they embark on their new journey. The game will introduce new Braves as the adventure progresses. Explorer Evra, Lord Don Qui, Protector Sancho...and many more! Always create a duo in order to advance further. Construct strategies and find synergies, double the builds and quadruple the fun! Uncover Braves' Alter-egos! As players progress through the Challenge Tiers, they will be able to unlock Braves' Alter-egos alone the way - Knight Kiki, who appears to be using gear borrowed from Lord Qui; Melisandre, Merlin's first apprentice who has gained knowledge \"directly\" from the Archmage; Evra, a mysterious girl who looks similar to Evra the Explorer but never speaks... Just clear the Challenge Tiers to unlock all of them! Bu...Bullet-Time?! Don't just sit, click and watch your cards get played! You can activate bullet-time at any time to determine the exact timing of your card play. Sometimes it just takes a carefully-timed block to turn the tide completely! Also, make sure you read the actions of your foes! You can time your move to dodge and then connect with counterattacks. Or maybe unleash a powerful MAX Move to sweep them all! A New Adventure Unfolds! For what seems like an eternity, the Braves have been stuck in the battle against the Ancient Dragon, with the ultimate goal of rescuing the Princess. However, this time things seem... different?! The Ancient Dragon is nowhere to be found, but so is our Princess... As the Braves embark on this new quest, they must be strategic in their approach. Randomized quests and events offer opportunities to grow stronger and acquire powerful items, but the Braves must choose wisely to ensure they are fully prepared for what lies ahead. Go Forth Braves! The fate of the kingdom rests in your hands. Let's bring our Princess home!","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0610/boyVCPRLjBxAL9iREvrNxr7q.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7786-PPSA10473_00-BREUSTPS50000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":"","genre":"Strategy","PlusPrice":141.75,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0610/boyVCPRLjBxAL9iREvrNxr7q.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Active DBG: Brave's Rage","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Shanghai Xingqi Network Technology Co.,Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-01","Slug":"active-dbg-braves-rage-ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":189,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":151.2,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Beveron is 3D racing game.

Set yourself up with a drone who can do the fighting for you or create an engineering build who can lay down traps and turrets as you back enemies into them.

The possibilities are endless and there is no correct way to overcome the ever-shifting procedural rooms of the mansion. The mansion itself also has a dimension-hopping twist. Each floor contains portals that lead you to alternate versions of the same location. Each dimension switches up the aesthetics and gameplay. You always start in the NeoCortex dimension, which plays out like an escape room, filled with challenges, puzzles and surprises. From there, you will receive quests that take you into the Reptilian Complex and the Limbic System Dimensions.

The first time Claeg realized something was wrong was when he went out on an errand for his wife Emma. He kissed her goodbye and mounted his horse to ride into town, but when he blinked once again, he was five miles away from home and his horse lay bleeding from its throat. He walked all the way back home covered in blood to meet the panicked tears of his wife, children, and friends. From then on, it took Claeg every fiber of his being to concentrate even on the smallest task. Doing work on the farm became insurmountable labor, and his children wept in the corners when he mixed up their names and faces. Emma took him to countless doctors who couldn\u2019t give a name to his ailment, but any person of the cloth they met all said the same thing: A demon was slowly taking over Claeg\u2019s body, and he was in dire need of salvation. \u201cThe demon is only sated after sacrifice!\u201d The good Christians would wail. \u201cStop him before it\u2019s too late.\u201d But the time to stop Claeg never came. And when he awoke one day to his friend\u2019s blood upon his throwing axe, his wails of anguish echoed through the town. It was death that brought Claeg back to life, and so Emma brought him to the man in DeSalle who they knew dealt in death. And death he dealt. Waking to become himself only when blood caked his hands, and his prey took their last breath. Countless has to die so that he, in a sense, wouldn\u2019t. So that he remembered the reason he lived this torturous existence. So that he could remember the laughs of his children and the touch of his wife. So that no demon could take his place. Claeg Grey donned the mask and robe not for himself, but for the sake of his family. So that no one would know his true self. So that his loved ones could finally find peace once more. And so that he could find clarity in freely administering death.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/2603/GQUzjouGDl0oxk0cmSu4j4Rs.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-THEHUNTGAME00046","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":107.4,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/2603/GQUzjouGDl0oxk0cmSu4j4Rs.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Hunt: Showdown \u2013 Fear The Reaper","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Crytek Gmbh","ReleaseDate":"2022-10-25","Slug":"hunt-showdown--fear-the-reaper-ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":179,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":107.4,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Pretty is a young bird learning to fly.

The Witch\u2019s House, originally released in 2012, falls within the tradition of Japanese horror RPGs with heavy emphasis on puzzle-solving and jump scares. Among other entries in the genre such as Ib and Ao Oni, The Witch\u2019s House surprised fans with pixel-art that conceals truly frightening horror. The Witch\u2019s House is deliberately designed with traps at *almost* every turn--sudden death is unpredictable and it keeps players on their toes. Anything can happen at any time. With completely remastered visuals, The Witch\u2019s House MV will feel fresh to even the most familiar old-school fans. Fans will also be greeted by a new difficulty mode that includes new events upon completion of the base game. - Completely reimagined graphics that make for a beautifully terrifying experience. - Brand new unlockable difficulty mode with new events and dialogue. - Violence and gore that are not recommended for the squeamish. Player discretion advised. - Sudden deaths that lurk around every corner and await every misstep. - Items must be used deliberately as players solve the puzzles for themselves. - Fixed save points (just keep an eye out for the talking black cat). - Convenient controls with diagonal movement.

Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they're the Freelance Police. And they're about to save the world. It's just another day at the office when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the \"spinny thing\" they do with their eyes.) Who's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds. ABOUT THIS REMASTER In 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within. Now everyone's favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell. Return to the adventure game that was once called \"gaming's first sitcom\" and is today known as \"the remaster you didn't know you were waiting for.\" With enhanced graphics, five new musical tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN's Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that you'll love to play\u2014or play again.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1517/6cR3MxF0nOi0WQxWQO4wa6FO.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5966-CUSA30837_00-8594065719104065","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIajN-DDmIk","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":139.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1517/6cR3MxF0nOi0WQxWQO4wa6FO.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Sam & Max Save the World","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SKUNKAPE GAMES","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-28","Slug":"sam--max-save-the-world-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":199,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":139.3,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Tip Top is an arcade style climbing game with procedurally generated routes that never repeat themselves!

In its warm embrace, pain helped Damien fight his remorse and shatter his memories \u2013 a blessing bestowed by the Lord himself. But as the years passed, his scars \u2013 testimonies to his imperious devotion \u2013 grew. Festering wounds stretched across his body like vast mountains, burying his nerves deep beneath thick layers of scab and scar, and one day, his body became numb, and pain, his guide to salvation, abandoned him. Each jolt of pain had been marked by sweat, blood, and his inharmonious moans that had kept his demons at bay, but that night his whip travelled in the air for nothing. A candle\u2019s light, too weak to even illuminate the wax underneath, flickered once, then twice, as the whip rose and fell, ripping off skin and flesh, but delivering no pain but disappointment. Shadows danced with the flickering light as if to celebrate their arrival, and the demons, screaming louder than ever, greeted Damien mockingly. An anguished moan echoed in his sanctum, a crypt cloistered beneath the St. Francis Seraph Church, and Damien trembled in desperation as his demons resurfaced. Possessed by a need for the scape of pain, he did what he had to do to silence them, wrapping the parts of his body untouched by the whip with barbed wire. But it wasn\u2019t enough. Desperate, he skinned his own face and hid it behind a cloth bag dipped in salt. But the ecstasy was temporary. The candle\u2019s light died, and with it, hope. He stood in the dark surrounded by his past as memories flashed before his eyes: his wife, chest cut open, face shredded, and hands tied with her own intestines \u2013 her eyes fixed on him, as if begging for mercy that is never to come. Behind her, his son, limbs severed from joints, each nailed on a big cross and crudely sewn together, forming a sculpture of flesh, and Damien holding the shotgun he later dubbed Delirium, as a reminder of his sins. And through the frenzy of images, a voice spoke of peace, the promise too tempting to resist. With The Scourge in his hand, still dripping his own blood, he took his first step into the AHA branch in Louisiana, and the voices, now harmonious, welcomed him to the Hunt.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0609/CZnmpbFHDPreLN9y6npndZFJ.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-THEHUNTGAME00045","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Action, Shooter","PlusPrice":107.4,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0609/CZnmpbFHDPreLN9y6npndZFJ.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Hunt: Showdown \u2013 The Penitent","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Crytek Gmbh","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-22","Slug":"hunt-showdown--the-penitent-ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":179,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":107.4,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"The World Knows You Exist.

In this void, your only means of escape is to cross floating platforms arranged in increasingly complex configurations. Obstacles move in patterns over and around them, forcing you to learn their movements to avoid getting knocked off a ledge or halted midair. Mannequins surround you, sometimes navigating the platforms themselves or simply observing. Perhaps they hold clues about the puzzles at hand, or perhaps they are just like you. Either way, they offer little comfort. Back Again is an eerie tale with a minimalistic narrative and unsettling atmosphere intended to test your skills, question your psyche and reward your determination, all set to a unique and ever-changing soundtrack to suit the mood. See the story to its end, retrying each sequence as many times as it takes, and once you\u2019ve built up enough confidence, choose Survival Mode to see if you can clear the entire game in a single attempt! Features: \u2022 Walk, run and jump across platforms in a harsh 3D puzzle-scape! \u2022 Navigate shifting obstacles by learning their patterns. \u2022 Witness creepy events and engage in a light narrative! \u2022 Get immersed with a unique ever-changing soundtrack. \u2022 Push your platforming skills to the limit in Survival Mode!

Whatever happened, she was driven to find order, to find a way to balance the odds. The rabbit hole she followed led deeper and deeper into a shadowy sect of the AHA that sought to keep the world\u2019s unpalatable truths covered. As she passed from success to success, the sect assigned her to straighten out one of their wayward sons, Isaac Powell. Powell, now The Night Seer, impressed Ozols with his vision of a world turned upside down. She grew jealous of his foresight and saw the way to achieve the justice she craved: a way to balance the rightness of actions by both their past and future effects. Ozols gained the Night Seer\u2019s trust, and he confided in her the ritual he had undertaken. She repeated it, and as the power coursed through her, it left her blind to the present, but with a powerful and uncanny sense of what was to come. But seeing the Night Seer\u2019s path, more vividly than he himself had ever managed, shocked Ozols. She shredded her white robes and dyed them black.

She tied the scraps around her weapons, sure reminders to keep her path true.

In turn, the Night Seer feels the threat of there being one with greater power than himself, and knows that his prophecy will not come true if another has witnessed it.

The Galactic Junkers is a comedic action-adventure space combat game that puts you in the role of a space captain on the run. Your ship might be falling apart and your crew isn\u2019t the best but with a little luck you can keep everything ship-shape. Upgrade your ship, hire new crew, steal supplies and equipment, and keep searching for the truth of why everyone wants you dead. Explore Take a journey across the solar system exploring all nine planets and their neighboring sectors. Discover mysterious asteroids, creaking space stations, abandoned shipwrecks, deadly pirates and much more. Mine, Salvage, Steal, and Trade Running a spaceship is never easy and there\u2019s always bills to pay. Keep your bank balance looking healthy by mining asteroids, salvaging derelicts, and trading with disreputable characters. Maybe you\u2019ll even partake in a little theft, but don\u2019t worry - we don\u2019t tell anyone. Battle and Board Enemy Ships Space is a deadly place so you\u2019ll have to fight for your life. Set your crew to operate the guns and show those pesky pirates what you are made of! Board enemy ships to smash and grab essential resources or hack systems from the shadows. Hire and Maintain your Crew A happy ship needs a happy crew, so look after your band of useful idiots. Nurture their skills to keep everything running smoothly, or if you don't like them, show them the airlock and hire new crew. Buy, Upgrade, and Repair Ships Maybe you need a little more juice in the engine department or your guns are falling short. Upgrade your ship to take control of the sector and make a name for yourself. Or if you prefer something a little fancier, trade in your ship for a better model. Just don\u2019t forget your maintenance routines! Protect You and Your Ship at all Costs Try not to get yourself blown up, captured, or otherwise incapacitated. We\u2019re counting on you to find the truth behind the bounty on your head and see if there\u2019s a bigger destiny for you out there.

The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game making it the definitive version on consoles of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience. Man Meets Magic & Machine In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It\u2019s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge\u2019s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the \u201cFlux State\u201d controls the city of Berlin. It\u2019s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there\u2019s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return\u2026 Key Features A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG\u2019s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters. A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique \u201cTech meets Magic\u201d dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director\u2019s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into. Command Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it\u2019s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in. Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you\u2019re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfall\u2019s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.

Experience the most impressive Shadowrun RPG yet, hailed as one of the best RPGs and strategy games of 2015, and now available on consoles! HONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. Key Features Shadows of Hong Kong Bonus Campaign: Set in the weeks following the events of the main campaign, the Shadows of Hong Kong bonus campaign will give you -- and your team -- the opportunity to turn the tables on the elite corporate police force that once hunted you. Through layers of corporate greed and urban strife, you will contend with dangerous enemies, uncover a deadly conspiracy, and cement your reputation as a Prime Runner\u2026 assuming that you survive, of course. A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Shadowrun: Hong Kong hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG\u2019s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 15+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters. A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique \u201cTech meets Magic\u201d dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting. Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into. Command Your Team: Just like Dragonfall, Shadowrun: Hong Kong features a crew of flawed, dangerous runners with backstories that could only be possible in the tech-meets-magic Shadowrun setting. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in. Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you\u2019re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Hong Kong\u2019s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.

But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they\u2019d ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she\u2019s never been before: the ghost of a young woman.

Drawn to Maddie in a way she can\u2019t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years.

This leads you straight into the middle of an exciting murder case and a murder mystery unfolds while you listen to the testimonies of witness, friends and relatives. The whole game is somewhat Christmas flavored - however, don't get yourself comfortable, the game not going to give you a nice and warm feeling but rather confront you with a cold and harsh reality as the thrilling storytelling of the game will leave you with a cold shiver down your spine. The game is a must have for any true fan of thrillers and anyone how enjoys a murder mystery that goes beyond the normal story telling. How does the gameplay work? You will play as a free-floating ghost like creature. Basically, as the soul of someone who is experiencing the story. You are very small in comparison to the surroundings and can fly freely through the area. You start by exploring the area and enjoying the feeling of flying as well as the gentle yet mysterious background music. Soon after starting to explore, you will find the first memory piece. You can collect the memory pieces to continue with the story and to advance with the overall narration. The story talks about a young boy, about his live and about how everything changes. It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. The first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become. Once you have finished a chapter by collecting all memory pieces and finishing the overall story of a level you will continue into the next chapter.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/0713/MdykcFBrVbTsRxO86dAiH7Uh.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6556-CUSA31171_00-6244328745700174","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":"","genre":"Horror, Unique, Simulation","PlusPrice":139.05,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/0713/MdykcFBrVbTsRxO86dAiH7Uh.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Murder Diaries 3 - Santa's Trail of Blood","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"EpiXR Games UG","ReleaseDate":"2021-12-16","Slug":"murder-diaries-3--santas-trail-of-blood-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":309,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":169.95,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"*** Includes online leaderboards *** Features \u2022 Over 5,000 questions split into 24 categories to really test people\u2019s knowledge of the world. \u2022 Three levels of difficulty to make it playable for the whole family. \u2022 Over 190 different countries featured.

Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny. In Evertried, the player\u2019s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don\u2019t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/98461","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3919-CUSA28219_00-EVERTRIEDPS4EU00","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImOYOo4RR4","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Strategy, Strategy, Strategy","PlusPrice":179.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Evertried","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-20","Slug":"evertried-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":359,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":179.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"RICO London is a gang-busting, name-taking, explosive co-op shooter.

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You\u2019re the only human there, after all. SURVIVAL Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game \u2013 including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™\u2019s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/80159","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0114/xvUwYjctSRFXETMYPdfkwDUc.png?w=200","MainStory":23,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4380-PPSA03754_00-3110489674172889","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9cj2mae5w","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":44,"genre":"Action, Strategy","PlusPrice":247.05,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0114/xvUwYjctSRFXETMYPdfkwDUc.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Riftbreaker","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Exor Studios","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-13","Slug":"the-riftbreaker-ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":549,"MainExtra":35,"SalePrice":301.95,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Catty & Batty: The Spirit Guide is a casual couch co-op puzzle game, inspired by Lemmings and Tower Defense!

And now, only on the HD remaster, you can customise TY's looks, and best of all there are two brand NEW never before seen boomerangs. * Explore from the beach to the desert to the billabong and beyond in a huge open world of old-school 3D platforming glory. * Arm yourself with 20 different boomerangs including the classic Ironbark, Flamerang and two NEW rangs! * Brand new photo-mode. * A wide variety of vehicles like the Fourbie, cart, and mechs, too. * 7 Levels of two-player split-screen cart racing. * Improved camera & graphics; including updated shadows, reflections and HD resolutions. * New Gamemode called \"Hardcore Mode\". * Over 25 Trophies, including a Platinum Trophy, plus Speed Run and Time Attack Leaderboards. * Character customisation with NEW skins for TY and paint jobs for the Fourbie! * Audio Director's cut. THE STORY Long ago, a great battle was fought. BOSS CASS sought out five mystic talismans, so he could banish every warm blooded creature, to THE DREAMING. But one brave soul stood up to CASS, and thwarted his quest for the talismans. He risked all, in an effort to save his family and friends. And in the end... he succeeded. CASS was banished for his crimes, and the land was made safe once again. All thanks to the true blue Aussie hero, TY the Tasmanian Tiger, and his friends at BUSH RESCUE. Now, evil stirs again - the little country town of CURRAWONG is under attack, and a hero is needed once more...","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/2806/pNyCZEaU0ikDsYEtK4mLbOvz.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5633-CUSA26866_00-7582797769000003","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":244.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/2806/pNyCZEaU0ikDsYEtK4mLbOvz.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"TY the Tasmanian Tiger™ 2: Bush Rescue™ HD","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"KROME INTERACTIVE","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-30","Slug":"ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-2-bush-rescue-hd-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":489,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":244.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"The Forgotten Relics Pack is a weapon and cosmetic pack containing the following items: 5 new weapons. 4 new paintings. 1 new portrait frame.

Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks. The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds. What\u2019s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\u2019ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production. They don\u2019t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\u2019ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\u2019t happen but marketing text is hard to write.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/68001","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/1209/bhgDakvgeEnnYx3kinsfd3cw.png?w=200","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1051-CUSA27278_00-SUPERMEATBOYFORE","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKjjyDUgGd8","PercentOff":"90%","Completionist":12,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":18.9,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/1209/bhgDakvgeEnnYx3kinsfd3cw.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Super Meat Boy Forever","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"TEAM MEAT LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-19","Slug":"super-meat-boy-forever-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":189,"MainExtra":7,"SalePrice":18.9,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Experience the most exciting and immersive beat-em-up combat system ever \u2013 become a kickass ninja and slice some demons in style!

A mix of retro graphics along with meta-narrative, stealth system and action combat with a high difficulty level. Timothy, a common child, wants to save his grandfather from certain death. The old man fell ill and he's now fighting for his life. Timothy, who loves his grandfather very much, decides to take a risky journey to the infamous Mysterious Forest. Legends speak of a magic mushroom able to cure any disease that grows into the forest. Timothy bravely begins his journey to find the magic mushroom. The game mixes elements from adventure/exploration games with puzzle and stealth: exploration, reading and keeping a slow pace is the best tactic. The high difficulty level is the base: Timothy is basically defenceless and dies with a single touch from enemies or traps. The world is full of ruins, graveyards and tombstones, caves, swamps and weird characters: every place is made to look wild, abandoned and dangerous. Except for Timothy's grandfather, most characters are often mean or clearly driven by not-so-nice feelings.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/71361","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/1621/GxSFUAnK1bbIMBkNgWWsPRVc.png?w=200","MainStory":2,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2696-CUSA25899_00-TIMOTHYPS4V10000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"82%","Completionist":4,"genre":"Adventure, Action","PlusPrice":7.11,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/1621/GxSFUAnK1bbIMBkNgWWsPRVc.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Timothy and the Mysterious Forest","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"QUBICGAMES SP.

Guide your agency through the space race and write your alternate history of space travel - any of the agencies can be the first to land on The Moon if you make the right choices. Manage the numerous challenges faced then and now: \u2022 Create your base with launch pads, research labs, astronaut training facilities, and much more \u2022 Construct your own custom vehicles from hundreds of combinations \u2022 Launch satellites and crewed spacecraft to explore the Solar System \u2022 Run mission control as you solve the various challenges of turn-based missions to earn scientific advancement and public support \u2022 Explore an extensive tech tree and compete or collaborate with other agencies to plot your roadmap to Mars \u2022 Choose from five unique space agencies, each with their own traits, base, vehicles, and spacecraft \u2022 Create your own custom space agency You\u2019re in charge of every element of the journey into space: success rides on your decisions. Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet? Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies? Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars. Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors. Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment. These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue? Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We\u2019ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.","SaleStarted":"2023-08-29","LowestPrice":"/game/85154","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png?w=200","MainStory":12,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5277-CUSA18418_00-0000000000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gqbz8C8bX0","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":92,"genre":"Strategy","PlusPrice":56.76,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Mars Horizon","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"THE IRREGULAR CORPORATION LTD.","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-17","Slug":"mars-horizon-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":172,"MainExtra":34,"SalePrice":56.76,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-09-13","description":"Create your own esports team and customize everything, from the official crest to the players\u2019 kits Hire the greatest stars in order to achieve your goals: if a player doesn't suit your need, change them out Train your players and take care of their well-being thanks to team bonding, scouting and a healthy lifestyle!

Step into the shoes of Sir Albert Wickes and The Right Honourable Clarence Baxter, two 19th century explorers who have chosen to pilot the HMS Fearful on its maiden voyage to Mars. When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park. It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece. For the solo voyager, the ship's computer-controlled cat will keep you company. Without a second pair of hands, Albert will need an extra dose of dexterity to navigate the challenges of Victorian space flight. The mix of action and thoughtful puzzles make 39 Days to Mars perfect for playing in short sessions. The entire adventure fits comfortably into an evening, or a long tea break.

In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle.
