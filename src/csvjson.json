Along the way she meets the cheerful pink-haired fairy, Ribbon, who mysteriously chooses to stay by Erina\u2019s side. These unwitting heroes embark together on their quest to restore Erina\u2019s life to normalcy, but who knows what troubles lurk, waiting for them\u2026 ●Explore! Plaform! Your own adventure! Rabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer that focuses on non-linear gameplay. There will be hints to guide the player along, but they\u2019re never required to follow them, which allows for much greater freedom to\u2014you guessed it\u2014explore. Players will play as our protagonist Erina, who focuses on close quarters combat. Ribbon the fairy is the ranged attacker who follows Erina\u2019s lead, indirectly controlled by the player.

Rife with dark humor, sarcastic quips, and the absurdity of the system. Seemingly built overnight, The Wall has divided both a country in two and a man from his family. To see them again, our ginger-haired protagonist has decided to become a contestant on \u201cThe Wall Show\u201d, a Regime-organized TV show allowing competitors the opportunity to escape to freedom on the other side. However, as he progresses through the camp, our contestant soon realizes exactly how the Regime and the show operate. The promise of freedom is not exactly what it seems. FEATURES * Cinematic platformer: Run, jump, crash, and climb your way through each Arena as the narrative unfolds around you. Much of the story is unveiled via smoothly integrated animation sequences, within the environment, or from NPCs muttering bits of dialogue as you dive and dodge around them. * Environmental HUD: Rather than having a screen cluttered with overlaid indicators, HP bars, and minimaps, any information the player will need is incorporated into the environment. Hints and clues are meshed into the game\u2019s art, subtle and specific, players will need a keen eye if they want to survive each Arena without breaking their legs. * Puzzle-solving: Use your wits, and at times a dash of ruthlessness, to advance through the Arenas.

When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park.

His works contain an affiliation with psychedelia, spirituality, alternate realities, and a blending of nature with technology.

Any one of three random murderers helps to minimize spoilers. ● Choices matter - catch the killer, save the victims, make and break relationships \u2013 or don\u2019t. ● Problem solving - can\u2019t get that vital clue yourself?

Who sent it? And why? Impossible questions, but your fate is sealed on finding out. Now, millions of miles away from home, a micrometeoroid storm damaged your spaceship and killed two vital members of your crew. The mission is no longer just discovery, but to survive the journey with those still left alive. Tharsis is built around a unique mix of a board game and video game mechanics. The outcomes of your choices are determined by rolls of the dice, but ultimately it is up to you and your decisions that will affect the mission\u2019s success. Guide your crew through onboard disasters, food shortages, and the unforgiving nature of space. Maintain what remains of their health and sanity as they are strained by a crumbling ship, lack of food and the strange and disturbing signals coming from the Red Planet. Succeeding in Tharsis requires you to make the best of what you have, even if everything indicates failure. Certain factors may be outside of your control, but that doesn't mean they can't be overcome. Be ready to plan and adapt continually. The game offers three levels of difficulty - easy for a fair learning curve, normal for those wanting a tough but fair challenge and hard for the true challenge seekers. Defy the odds, make the difficult decisions, and embark on a harrowing mission of survival and fate. Features: - Turn-based space survival strategy game.

But for what? To test their cooperation skills of course! So they tied them together to a tiny monstrous chain and let them make their way through colourfull, tricky, cooperative experimental set-ups that only scientists can think up. Anybody complained the plot is as flat as 2D? Bullseye! You are right. The unbelievable truth is: YOU are the monsters and WE are the scientists.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself! By using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DreamAlone_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/dream-alone-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"80%","genre":"Platformer,Action,Arcade,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"1.50","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_DreamAlone.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"18.00","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/6333/dream-alone-switch","RussiaPrice":"75","Title":"Dream Alone","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"No Gravity Games","ReleaseDate":"2018-06-28","Slug":"dream-alone-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"4.00","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"18.99","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"8.56","SCORE":"48","SaleEnds":"2022-01-04","LowestPrice":"6.79","SaleStarted":"2021-12-18","description":"Planar Conquest is a 4X strategy game inspired by Master of Magic.

Fresh but familiar gameplay ensures that Ekstase is easy to pick up and sink many hours into. With both classic and new game modes, there is something here for both the casual and the hardcore puzzle game player. Gameplay description In Ekstase, shapes of 3-5 blocks fall from the top, and as soon as they hit something, they fall apart. The scan line changes color every cycle and removes the squares you formed with blocks of the same color. Game modes Reach a \"state-of-flow\" in Flow mode Flow mode is the frictionless \"jump in\" game mode in which the game adapts to how you play. Are you getting better? The game will ramp up its difficulty. Are you getting worse? The game becomes easier.

Keep a beat with Beat99 Beat99 is the rhythm mode in Ekstase . The goal is to rank up your multiplier by dropping shapes to the beat.

This mobile app version of the game recreates the original game, including hidden elements. The game system has been rearranged to make it easier to play. In addition, this title has been improved with the G-MODE archives. The \"Arrange\" mode allows you to fly through the air more intensely and smoothly. The game includes two modes: \"Arrange\" mode, which is more intense and smoother, and \"Original\" mode, where you can enjoy the nostalgic graphics of the time. There are eight types of special weapons. Each weapon has its own unique characteristics, and the power of each weapon increases with successive attacks. The thrill comes from the large number of bullets that the enemy attacks with. Use the special attacks to your advantage to defeat the final boss! ■ About G-MODE Archives The G-MODE Archives is a reissue project that faithfully recreates old feature phone games as they were back then.

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia. Design: a completely new approach with amazing results Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds. Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay.

Eighties of the twentieth century. The golden age of 8-bit video games. We were leaving school, and we were going to spend our precious coins in the arcade machines. One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari's Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn't pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time.

The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles. Leveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area. Players are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far. The type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","Image":"https://images.eshop-prices.com/resize?f=jpeg&h=240&url=https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animus-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"63%","genre":"Action,Role-Playing,Arcade,Fighting","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"4.80","MexPrice":"https://cdn01.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"48.10","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"221","Title":"ANIMUS","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"TROOOZE","ReleaseDate":"2019-01-03","Slug":"animus-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"14.05","ChilePrice":"","Price":"7.99","MexicoPrice":"55.13","SalePrice":"2.95"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.49","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-01-08","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2021-12-18","description":"Archery Blast offers an ultra-realistic archery experience with stunning 3D graphics, amazing animations and simple intuitive controls.
