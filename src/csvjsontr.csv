It tells the story of a young nun who sets off on a journey of self-discovery with the most unusual, horn-headed companion by her side. On the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance—as she speaks with the devil himself. Indika’s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery. The world she discovers can only be described as a wild combination of comedy and tragedy straight out of the novels by Dostoyevski and Bulhakov. ENJOY AN INDIE GAME WHERE EVERYTHING GOES The subjects of religion and authority are prevalent throughout Indika’s journey and she’ll be faced with many questions along the way. Guide her to find the answers one by one before she can finish her life-defining odyssey. Odd Meter is a small, independent studio formerly based in Moscow and now operating out of Kazakhstan. Its members put aesthetics at the forefront and aren’t afraid to tread the fine line of ethical norms. Their game is a great testament to that, as INDIKA constitutes an open challenge to the industry's established approach to creating video games.","2024-11-07","/game/139446","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/1114/2ab11b93f3b922d21a0c77af4baf962952e4e4d4ac775641.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-PPSA16214_00-0000000000INDIKA","20%","5","Adventure","612.5","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/indika","INDIKA","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2024-05-17","indika-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","4","700.00","0","",

"82","2024-11-22","Immerse yourself in a dramatic yet charming and witty world of evidence-gathering, deduction and courtroom battles with this double-pack of the adventures of rookie lawyer Ryunosuke. Set in late 19th century Japan and London, each title features five murder-mystery episodes filled with all the drama, laughs, twists and “turnabouts” you’ve come to expect from the legally labyrinthine legacy of Ace Attorney. Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you! In the course of each case, you’ll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimony, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn’t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn’t shout “OBJECTION!” when you know you’ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution’s claims and prove your client’s innocence.

Play as the #2 best investigator as you find clues, question silly suspects, and look at things through your magnifying glass. Some nay-sayers have called the magnifying glass ""useless"", but what do they know? In Case 1, The Haunted Island, a sloth has been haunted for weeks by a mysterious ghost that nobody can seem to track down. Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective. In the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbor has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbor is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer. In the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all...

"79","2024-11-22","One of 2022’s most acclaimed indies, the Game Awards-nominated Citizen Sleeper comes to PlayStationÂ®! You are a sleeper, a digitised human consciousness in an artificial body, owned by a corporation that wants you back. Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle. COMPLETE. EXPANDED. The PlayStationÂ® version of Citizen Sleeper includes the complete post-launch three episode sequence, which expands the lore of the game, and introduces additional characters and locations to Erlin’s Eye in an exciting late game storyline. ROLL THE DICE. DO THE WORK. GET PAID. SURVIVE. Inspired by Tabletop Roleplaying games, Citizen Sleeper uses Dice, Clocks and Drives to create a player-led experience, where you choose your path in a rich and responsive world. Each cycle you use the dice you are dealt to choose what to do with your time. Make or break alliances, uncover truths and escape your hunters. Survive and ultimately thrive, one cycle at a time, and sometimes against the clock! TURN UP FOR YOUR FRIENDS The station plays host to characters from all walks of life, trying to eke out an existence among the stars. Salvagers, engineers, hackers, bartenders, street-food vendors, each has a history which brought them here. You choose which of them you wish to help, and together you will shape your future. ACCESS THEIR SECRETS Eventually, you will learn to use your dice to hack into the station’s cloud to access decades of digital data, uncover new areas and unlock secrets. This is your unique power, and with it you can change your future. Corporate secrets, rogue AIs and troves of lost data await those willing to dive into the depths of the station’s networks. YOU WERE MADE TO DIE Essen-Arp: to them you are just property, one more asset in a portfolio that stretches across the stars. You are the product of an abusive system, in a universe where humanity’s expansion is marked by exploitation and extraction. Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom.","2024-11-07","/game/94117","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1609/e3278cdeab2b05d0b0ff86c29c14f8b48ea0ada641ca1595.png?w=200","6","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5661-PPSA13629_00-CITIZENSLEEPER00","60%","12","Role-Playing","279.6","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/citizen-sleeper","Citizen Sleeper","TRD","SURPRISE ATTACK PTY LTD T/A FELLOW TRAVELLER GAMES","2023-03-31","citizen-sleeper-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","9","279.60","1","",

"76","2024-11-22","Place pieces, paint the board, make music. Chime Sharp is an sequel to 2009's Chime, a music puzzle game with an addictive, ambient heartbeat. You tessellate shapes to cover a grid, while a beatline reads those shapes as notes. As you cover the board the music builds to a beautiful crescendo of your own design. The only way to discover Chime is to play it, but if you want a glimpse, consider what it might feel like to cross Tetris, a music sequencer and a hypnotic dream about your favourite pop song. Chime Sharp takes Chime's classic dynamic and updates it for 2017. The core rules are the same but the aesthetic is clean and modern and the game's soundtrack has been completely refreshed. With sixteen new levels, experimental modes, new-era connectivity and sharper ways to play, Chime's finally back -- and it wants to be your new favourite mixtape.

"75","2024-11-22","The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. STORY MODE The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episodes 1+2 were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - “DO NOT GO GENTLE” Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - “LUMINACE FUGUE” Mackenzie’s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? EPISODE THREE - ""CROSSROADS ELEGY"" In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? EPISODE FOUR - ""FURY, THEN SILENCE"" A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. SURVIVAL MODE Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202109/2306/ChPARRL6cgDRc3GuWkLZOZIa.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2845-CUSA09690_00-TLDRKFULLGAMEPS4","50%","0","Action, Adventure, Adventure","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-long-dark","The Long Dark","TRD","Hinterland Studio Inc.","2017-08-08","the-long-dark-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","524.50","1","",

"69","2024-11-22","Ganryu 2 is the sequel to the Ganryu game made by VISCO on NEOGEO back in 1999. The universe takes place in a feudal fantasy Japan which is strongly inspired by the story of Takezo Musashi, whose adventures are unfolded in a series of books (mainly ""The Stone and the Sword""). You play as Miyamoto Musashi travelling through a 17th century fantasy Japan, from north to south to the island of Ganryu-jima where everything started between Musashi and Kojiro. Story: After his victory against Kojiro, Musashi decided to meditate and try his hand at art, in the north of Japan, in the province of Hokkaido. During one of his meditations, a spirit contacted him : ""Miyamoto Musashi, our fight is not over, I am waiting for you to finish our fight once and for all! All of Japan will pay for your insult! I'm waiting for you Miyamoto Musashi!” There is no doubt for Musashi that the voice was the Sasaki KojirÅ�’s one. His body was defeated, but his spirit remains, and his intentions are still destructive. Miyamoto Musashi then understood that he would have to travel across Japan from north to south and go to the island of GanryÃ»-jima, where he firstly defeated Sasaki KojirÅ�, to fight again and liberate the spirit of Kojiro forever. Features: - A hack'n'slash inspired by the story of Takezo Musashi “The Stone And The Sword” released in 1930’s by Eiji Yoshikawa and which is one of the most famous story and real samurai in Japan! - Explore a 17th century fantasist Japan through seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. - Defeat Kojiro in The Floating Fortress and save Japan! - Dash, double-jump, wall-jump and throw kunais to defeat various enemies! - Use your special abilities, kamis, to take advantage of your enemies. - Collect Hanafuda cards through levels. - A beautiful pixel-art game inspired by classics !","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/1610/20L2cSpR02Q2UajXyvzBxpl7.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8208-CUSA32758_00-GANRYUGAMEEURPS4","90%","0","Action, Action","52.9","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/ganryu-2-hakuma-kojiro","Ganryu 2 : Hakuma Kojiro","TRD","Just for Games SAS","2022-03-09","ganryu-2-hakuma-kojiro-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","529.00","0","52.90","1","",

"67","2024-11-22","AUTHENTIC GAMEPLAY With the dual stick controls, each stick represents one of your feet. You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. ""IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN"" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels…) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones for your style and shred the most iconic spots!","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/2412/267dcd99838eca943a1ab23184ecacde8a479ea56d9d37ad.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06510_00-SSSG000000000000","75%","0","Simulation, Sport","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/session-skate-sim","Session: Skate Sim","TRD","NACON SA","2022-09-22","session-skate-sim-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","0","437.25","1","",

Solo – Islands of the Heart explores the theme of love in an introspective way, allowing players to identify and reflect on their own experiences. The world is divided into archipelagos, with each island representing a unique puzzle. Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships. As with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island. Nature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think. 1 player 735MB minimum save size HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

MURDER HOUSE - A news crew breaks into the old abandoned home of an executed serial killer Anthony Smith, planning to shoot a salacious haunted house story. But is the notorious Easter Ripper really dead or is he waiting inside, ready to wipe them out one by one? Who will survive, and what will be left of them? The spiritual successor to Babysitter Bloodbath. NO ONE LIVES UNDER THE LIGHT HOUSE - The previous lighthouse keeper has gone missing without a trace and you are the newest keeper tasked with keeping the lighthouse lit every night.

"","2024-11-22","Road Defense: Outsiders is a game that combines elements of the 'roguelike' and 'tower defense' genres. Upgrade the towers and your own skills to be able to annihilate all the life around you! During the game, every time a driver reaches the end of the road, he pays a fee. Well, maybe this is not completely legal, but use the money received to buy new weapons for the towers or upgrade the ones already installed. This money received from the drivers is not going to solve all your problems, and if you depended on it alone, you would already be dead. For this reason, each enemy killed can release an orb that raises your experience bar. Every time this experience bar fills up, you level up and can temporarily improve your skills. In this way, the more enemies you kill during a wave, the more orbs you collect and the stronger you get. Not everything may go as planned and sooner or later you will end up being killed by these gangs. When this happens, don't despair, because the total number of enemies you have killed during the match is also converted into money! And it is at this point that you can improve your skills permanently, starting the next match stronger and with more advantages.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202408/1921/49d72097b6b4346eb582413f303f1565e82ca9d099d17515.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0546-CUSA49999_00-ROADDEFENSEPS4EU","20%","0","Shooter","140","null","null","Road Defense: Outsiders","TRD","QUBYTE","2024-09-12","road-defense-outsiders-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","175.00","0","140.00","1","",

"","2024-11-22","The story of Raji: An Ancient Epic begins with the start of a new war between the demons and the gods. Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction. Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons. Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race. Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war. Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura. Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene! Every corner of the game’s environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games. Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next. For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored. From enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202404/0813/3e8fb0793c66003c8cec1a334d627ac8ae96397898ade99c.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5176-PPSA21947_00-0115935370185432","75%","0","Action","0","null","null","Raji: An Ancient Epic","TRD","NODDING HEADS GAMES","2024-04-16","raji-an-ancient-epic-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","629.00","0","157.25","1","",

Home sweet home Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. The more the merrier… You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable. Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you. ParadiZe welcomes everyone with open arms! Well?

In this dark fantasy adventure you solve intricate cases and unveil abysmal secrets as Inquisitor Mordimer Madderdin. The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation. Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy’s weak points against them.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0813/6c0abbadb6ee8ae04ec8ba8c2b225bedacea0bd6a8733cd9.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA10961_00-0THEINQUISITORDX","30%","0","Adventure","629.3","null","null","The Inquisitor - Deluxe Edition","TRD","Kalypso Media GMBH","2024-02-08","the-inquisitor-deluxe-edition-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","899.00","0","629.30","0","",

"","2024-11-22","Euphoria is a first-person puzzle game combining elements of social fiction, detective and horror with deep philosophical insight. The players will have to crack some grim criminal cases by exploring the world around them, rediscover the mysterious identity of the protagonist, cross the borders of inherent dangers and formal logic and create their own vision of time and history. BECOME A MYSTERY HUNTER A true hunter always trusts their gut instincts. They see moments of doubt as a waste of time as the path to the truth lies clear before their mind’s eye. It’s an intricate network of barely visible strings and links between other people’s secrets, mysteries and motives… You just have to pull the right string which will lead you to the solution. Become a hunter whose primary weapons are his mind and heart. COMPOSE YOUR VISION OF THE WORLD FROM BITS OF INFORMATION The main feature of this game is the unusual mix of sci-fi, social fiction, detective and horror. Each genre presents a unique story; the players may freely combine fragments of information from them all to create their own versions of this world, its history and the causes of main events. The identity of the protagonist is a mystery itself, and you’ll have to approach the storyline like a puzzle to solve it. FOLLOW THE STORIES OF THOSE WHO GOT LOST IN THIS LABYRINTH BEFORE Each and every person who had passed through this world before the protagonist came had their own vision of what was going on. Each and every one of them left some clues. The data that you’ll eventually gather might sometimes be inconsistent and controversial, but there will also be similar or even duplicate bits of valuable information. Trying to make any sense out of all this is hard, but the process itself will definitely bring you closer to the truth. CATCH A SOUNDWAVE Your mysterious benefactor created a special mix of background sounds to set the mood for thought. All the mysteries will surely give in if you immerse yourself in the music and let it stimulate your subconscious. Clear your mind of doubts and trust your intuition.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/2214/6d4ff137524baa71fde68b42ce388f8862e2450f9674dabe.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2029-CUSA44243_00-0232807604720217","75%","0","Puzzle","52.35","null","null","Euphoria","TRD","Whale Rock Games OOO","2024-01-24","euphoria-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","87.25","1","",

"","2024-11-22","""Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined,"" wrote Albert Camus, and it is hard to disagree with this. To contemplate one's life means to knock oneself down, to stop, to begin to go over one's experiences, to discard the superfluous and unnecessary, to destroy the old in the hope of constructing the new, in other words, to be undermined. It is impossible not to note the severity of this word because this action is associated with pain, loss, the need to choose difficult routes, and sometimes taking risks so as not to make new mistakes and not to fall off the set path. But is it worth enduring the pain? What happens if we simply go with the flow? How will our lives turn out then? The French philosopher Albert Camus asked similar questions in his famous essay ""The Myth of Sisyphus. In brief, the ancient Greek myth is as follows: the gods condemned Sisyphus, because he was too arrogant and too dodgy, to roll a huge stone up the mountain, which kept falling and had to start all over again. It would seem that what could be worse than this useless work? What was Sisyphus thinking as he climbed to the top of the mountain? And what do we care about him? Maybe we should admit that our lives are a bit like this Sisyphus? Approach Albert Camus's thoughts and feelings, his philosophy. Perhaps you will find some answers to these difficult questions. • Explore the world around you and find philosophical notes. • Take the stone to the top, higher and higher, and if it falls, well, start over, that's your punishment. • Choose your path correctly. Your decisions will determine the end of the game. • Discover the philosophy of Albert Camus. Don't try to understand every word, just let it pass through you. • Enjoy the abstract game world, and find different ways of passing. • And also listen to atmospheric music and sound effects.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/1720/2ec7923b93669974f8483c69eb15b79f726c80c93b2ed5f8.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2029-CUSA44262_00-0936199158514762","75%","0","Adventure","52.35","null","null","Heavy Burden","TRD","Whale Rock Games OOO","2024-01-23","heavy-burden-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","87.25","1","",

RogueDefender Each run will be different but players will keep some of their Master's bonuses between runs. Like we've already mentioned, our game is a mix between Roguelite and Dungeon Management. How did we achieve that? By running many tests to find the perfect balance between management and dungeon phases!""""

When you think your dungeon is ready, let the crawl begin! You will then be able to watch those heroes die! It's a reversed dungeon crawler: heroes will move through your dungeon and will trigger the traps you placed. When a group of adventurers encounters a group of monsters you positioned in your dungeon, a turn-based fight will happen!

There are many ways to be evil. Choose from three overlord Archetypes - each one provides you with a different playstyle. Do you want to focus on sheer destruction or are you into a more subtle puppetmaster approach? You can experiment by combining destructive spells. The easiest way to wipe out villagers is to simply cast powerful spells like Earthquakes, Lightning and more. But what happens when you hurl a meteor at a poisonous puddle? Poisonous meteor explosions, that's what! And that's just one of the many nefarious ways that you can combine elemental interactions. You can afflict villagers with flaws. Sure, you could just destroy the world with ice and fire, but the real fun begins when you meddle with villager lives to put them into compelling and tragic situations! Afflict an annoying husband with Unfaithfulness and then watch the fireworks once you tell his wife of his misdeeds. You can spawn monsters to kidnap and harass villagers. You can snatch or seize a roaming monster and then breed it in your Kennel. This will allow you to summon them as part of your monster parties. Create monster parties to snatch Villagers or raid Villages. You can spread malicious info. Your Beholder Structure allows you to spawn Eyes all over the world to gather information.

Do you want to focus on sheer destruction or are you into a more subtle puppetmaster approach? Slowly gain new powers by upgrading the Portal. Continue to sinisterly interact with the world to produce Chaotic Energy. You gain permanent access to more heinous Powers by upgrading the Portal. Depending on map size - from small to extra large - one playthrough may be longer or shorter. But more villagers means more ways to combine your demonic skills! You can experiment by combining destructive spells. The easiest way to wipe out villagers is to simply cast powerful spells like Earthquakes, Lightning and more. But what happens when you hurl a meteor at a poisonous puddle? Poisonous meteor explosions, that's what! And that's just one of the many nefarious ways that you can combine elemental interactions. You can afflict villagers with flaws. Sure, you could just destroy the world with ice and fire, but the real fun begins when you meddle with villager lives to put them into compelling and tragic situations! Afflict an annoying husband with Unfaithfulness and then watch the fireworks once you tell his wife of his misdeeds. You can spawn monsters to kidnap and harass villagers. You can snatch or seize a roaming monster and then breed it in your Kennel. This will allow you to summon them as part of your monster parties. Create monster parties to snatch Villagers or raid Villages. You can spread malicious info. Your Beholder Structure allows you to spawn Eyes all over the world to gather information. You've seen a Knight steal a Shaman's Potion? Store it as an Intel and then tell the Shaman about it! You can spread Plague. Build the Biolab to afflict Villagers with Plague and summon Plagued Rats. Upgrade your plague with various nasty symptoms and improve its virulence. You can even make Plagued victims explode when they die! You can torture people. You can build a Prison and incarcerate villagers. If necessary, you can torture them in ridiculous ways to afflict them with random flaws. Perhaps someone will have mental anguish and become a Serial Killer when it gets back to its village? You can brainwash folks into becoming cultists. You can also try to brainwash your prisoners. If successful, it will return to its village as a secret cultist who will quietly worship and aid you. You can start a zombie apocalypse. You can also make the Plagued dead rise as zombies. Other villagers that they attack may also contract the virus. Soon, the entire village will be filled with nothing but shambling zombies. You can make Vampires and Werewolves. Afflict a Villager with Vampirism or Lycanthropy to turn them into denizens of the night. Watch as they terrorize their neighbors and spread the curse!

"","2024-11-22","A story from the legends, but in real history Winter War: over 500,000 Soviet soldiers attack Finland, a country with a population of 3,700,000, and the Finns drive them back, inflicting 5 times their own casualties. Continuation War: the Reds return with a total strength of 1,500,000 - almost half of the entire Finnish population - and the Finns stop them again. Finland’s survival in these two brutal wars against an enemy so vast was a true historical miracle. A miracle of heroism and valor. A miracle of the Finnish spirit of liberty. Experience heroic struggle and make tough choices You are the commander of the scarce Finnish troops. Your only goal - to save your homeland and your people from total annihilation. Would you risk losing your experienced troops to try and capture the enemy tanks? Would you try to save the stragglers during the retreat and risk losing everyone, or cut your losses and establish a new line of defense? Would you agree to negotiate with the Soviets that had treacherously attacked you twice before? Play two campaigns: historical and “what if” Historical campaign: Play through a number of missions throughout the 1939-1945 timeline, spanning three wars: Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War. The historical campaign will have smaller-scale but action-packed operations, covering all of the iconic historical battles. Complete numerous objectives grounded in history and narrated by a number of historical characters. Alternate history campaign: Play a shorter campaign with larger operations, centered around the “what if” events. Help the Germans take Leningrad, cut off the allied aid shipments to USSR by taking the port of Murmansk - that is only the beginning. Features: Immerse yourself into the history-driven gameplay: Thanks to cinematics before and after each operation you’ll watch history unfold through the eyes of the key historical figures of the time. Create and grow the army of your own design: Use a number of historical vehicles - all of which are available at historically accurate points in time. Train your troops and choose equipment: Choose various skills for your men as they gain combat experience. Combine units from different classes and acquire diverse equipment for them! Use historical heroes: Every unit could meet certain high requirements to generate a hero with a unique set of powerful skills. For Example the deadliest sniper in WW2 history - Simo HÃ¤yhÃ¤ Manage your Headquarters between the operations: More firepower or better intel - choose in which direction your HQ staff will improve. Use elaborate combat mechanics to overcome any foe: Lethal vs Nonlethal damage or using terrain differences to your advantage - those are just a few of the combat mechanics in-game. Utilize advanced supply and infrastructure systems: All units have limited ammo and fuel that are necessary to operate. You can use this and cut enemy supplies!","2024-11-07","/game/105469","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/0412/7be3130e648346b605f98c4c8947b69725d22aa371a8500d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-PPSA16443_00-0902122838417649","40%","0","Strategy, Strategy","999999","null","null","Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty","TRD","Klabater","2023-10-26","strategic-mind-spirit-of-liberty-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","0","629.40","1","",

Archetype Arcadia is a dark, sci-fi visual novel set in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious disease called the 'Original Sin' has wiped out most of humanity. The story revolves around Rust and his sister, roaming empty lands and searching desperately for other humans alive. All other humans have supposedly fallen victim to the disease which causes those inflicted to suffer from insanity, sensory illusions, and uncontrollable self-destructive urges. The only way to control those symptoms is by spending time inside a virtual game called Archetype Arcadia. Rust doesn't suffer from the disease, but when his sister who does mysteriously falls unresponsive one day, he must enter the virtually immersive game and navigate this unseen world to find a fix for his sister. Within the game exists a whole new world full of people and monsters. A world in which wearing a game device allows players to utilize powerful memories and corresponding avatars to fight each other. While this virtual existence supposedly delays the disease, it also carries severe consequences. As Rust battles his way through this strange world for a cure, he meets various people with unexpected identities and origins, makes unbreakable friendships, and undoubtedly some enemies along the way.

"","2024-11-22","There’s an old tradition running in your homeland: to become an adult and complete the coming of age ritual, you must go on a journey of discovery. Your adventure begins on a distant island, deep in a tropical Archipelago. What was once a prosperous tourist destination is now a shade of its former glory: and it’s your job to bring it back to life! Explore the Archipelago, meet the locals, and lend them a hand to restore the tourist paradise… while you try to uncover the mysteries of your past! SETTLING IN A NEW PLACE Your tropical life will be a busy one, so grab your tools and let’s get started! First things first: you’ll need a source of food, a place to spend the night in, and some resources to build a farm and kickstart your tropical journey. So what are you waiting for — time to explore your lands! A PLETHORA OF ACTIVITIES There’s plenty to do in Spirit of the Island! No matter how you choose to spend your time, you will gain experience and improve your skills, unlock new recipes, and become more efficient at everything you do, which will make your new life easier. Spirit of the Island features 10 unique skills, such as farming, mining, foraging, social, and even fishing, which comes as its own special mini-game. Will you become a true master of all? YOUR JOURNEY TO A TOURIST PARADISE Make your island not only a welcoming home but also a booming tourist paradise, with fancy shops and landmarks. The more tourists you get, the better your economy will be, which is a crucial step to fund your journeys to the faraway Islands. But how do you please them all, and what do you sell in your stores? That’s where your skills will come in handy! Sell local produce; open museums to display the treasure and secrets you uncover on your adventures. We bet some of your visitors could even buy a couple of quality wooden planks, so do your best to improvise! THE BEST TRIP EVER Each tourist will have a chance to love your Island so much that they’ll decide to stay, adding to the Town’s population. This part is crucial since you can hire them to do various things for you, such as tending to your shops and helping you maintain the Island. So do your best to make their trip a fantastic one! THE POWER OF TWO One of the main features of Spirit of the Island is a 2-player cooperative mode, where you can do… everything together! You will have all single-player mode features available in online play with its own unique story. Grow crops, set up a store, and sell your produce to tourists, explore the vast Archipelago, and discover the secrets of the tropical paradise together with a friend! VAST TROPICAL ARCHIPELAGO Spirit of the Island features 14 explorable islands, each with its own fauna, secrets, and dangers. Information on who - or what - inhabits these islands has been lost to history, but you will find mysterious caves guarded by ancient creatures — are you brave enough to explore them and uncover the mysteries within? Doing so will net you neat rewards and help you proceed towards your final goal: revealing the secret of your past. THE LOCAL COMMUNITY The Archipelago is bustling with life! Meet more than 14 unique characters, each with its own distinct traits and quirks. And yes, there are romance options as well! Depending on your character, you’ll be able to romance and marry different NPCs and hold a grandiose wedding in the end! AN EVENTFUL LIFE One of the unique features of Spirit of the Island is events — a series of recurring occurrences happening through each in-game year (4 months). They will come in various forms: from birthdays and traditional Holidays to your own unique events. There’s always something fun happening in Town, so make sure to check your calendar often!","2024-11-07","/game/109925","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/1615/jfTgsNhsgDDUp0kpRg2yoevL.png?w=200","31","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1302-PPSA13934_00-0584770477306422","30%","0","Adventure, Simulation, Party","568.75","null","null","Spirit of the Island","TRD","Plug In Digital","2023-10-19","spirit-of-the-island-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","38","612.50","1","",

ENDLESSâ„¢ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESSâ„¢ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her ""unusual"" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESSâ„¢ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations.

But he can still be defeated. You will start your adventure over and over again, that's how this kind of games works, right? Don't panic, even if you're defeated, you still keep some of the stuff and upgrades you earned the last time you lived... Some of them, at least.

No matter how many times you’re defeated, your progression in the skill tree will be saved, as well as the world improvements you unlocked will last forever. Random worlds Summum Aeterna includes a unique world generator system never seen before in the genre, the Seed Mechanic... Each one generates a unique world with different enemy behavior, special events, and even a larger map size, depending on the rarity and the genes contained in the germinated seed. The world modifiers, so-called “seed genes” are positive and negative attributes included in each seed you find. They will determine the dangers, encounters and rewards waiting for you once you start playing. You can generate the world that best suits your playstyle. Seeds create worlds and genes make each seed different from the last, and so will the worlds generated from them! Brutal fast-paced combat The key to surviving in Summum Aeterna is killing every single living (or undead, depending on the enemy) being you encounter. How to achieve that? Well, you play as a cursed monarch… Your weapons are crafted for a king! Show no mercy, use your swords, pistols, and scythes to make them beg for their miserable lives before they do the same to you... You will choose a starting weapon at the beginning of each world, but you can switch it for a better one, whatever its type... It’s up to you and your skills! Summum Aeterna also includes weapon customization options thanks to the gems, precious stones that increase weapon attributes and add cool upgrades. Add new offensive and passive capabilities and improve the combat performance of your weapons by embedding gems. You can also ascend your weapons to Summum level and unchained their true power by collecting specific diagrams! Custom adventures In Summum Aeterna you can define your own adventure.

"","2024-11-22","Weedcraft Inc explores the business of producing, breeding and selling weed in America, delving deep into the financial, political and cultural aspects of the country's complex relationship with this troublesome and promising plant. Would-be marijuana moguls will need to prioritize resources carefully as they manage the production and distribution of their weed. Cultivate killer plants, cross-breed them to create unique strains of the devil’s lettuce, hire and manage a growing staff, and be prepared to take on the competition. As in real life, the business of bud presents plenty of opportunity along with a plethora of problems. Decide when and where to take on extra risk to maximize profit, but be careful, the cops and politicians are all working their own angles. An important, controversial topic presented in an insightful and detailed manner, Weedcraft Inc presents a challenge to those who would rule the reefer, offering a series of diverse scenarios and unique characters to work with (or around) as your budding empire grows. Whether you choose to hobnob with politicians, pay off the police, fight for medical marijuana rights or work the legal system, it’s all in the name of the sticky icky and your cutthroat corporate profits. --- BEGIN WITH PASSION FOR MOONSHINE We love moonshin’. There ain’t nothin’ better than good booze. In Appalachia, we know it well. We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught!","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0410/3b69a8fabd03f283a64ce0ac05d6ac9ac2cd3e11aedd4138.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA29034_00-0157935667191883","40%","0","Simulation, Strategy","675.95","null","null","Weedcraft Inc + Moonshine Inc Bundle","TRD","Klabater","2023-08-24","weedcraft-inc-+-moonshine-inc-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1229.00","0","737.40","1","",

We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner. You will progress through main missions, you’ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises... If you’ll be prospering, you’ll get the chance to create and manage bases in five different regions, each with its own, more and more challenging missions. From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there’ll be a pesky agent who’ll want to work with you, and there’ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You’re a free man, after all. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught!

Based on the rider selected, playing and controlling your rider is now different. It's easier to reach maximum speed and to take certain trajectories tightly with a rider like Wout van Aert than with PrimoÅ¾ RogliÄ�. But be careful, because the lower the Downhill and Agility ratings of your cyclist, the more control you need! STAND OUT FROM OTHER RIDERS To add more immersion to the core of Tour de France 2023, we added two new bibs this year. You can now see and wear the """"super combative"""" bib and the best team bib. Prove you deserve to wear these distinctions by showing your panache! As in real life, riders can form a """"grupetto"""" to make a breakaway or if they have fallen behind. This helps to limit damage during difficult stages and conserve energy for future stages or the end of the race. SMOOTHER RACES In Tour de France 2023, trajectories and collisions have been redesigned so you can navigate within the peloton more easily. Thanks to these improvements, you can reposition yourself more easily and prepare for the end of the race as ideally as possible. All ratings have been updated based on the results of the riders' last season so that they reflect reality and the latest performances of professional cyclists. The Race of the Moment mode has also been updated with new challenges, races and optimisations that add more variety.

"0","2024-11-22","Whether you are a long-time fan of the world created by J. R. R. Tolkien or whether you are exploring The Lord of the Rings for the first time, the Precious Edition offers an even more immersive game experience. This edition includes: - The Lord of the Rings: Gollumâ„¢ base game. - The Sindarin VO DLC, which adds a touch of authenticity to dialogue with the Elves. - The Lore Compendium DLC, a treasure trove of information about the game's key characters, locations and events, taking you deep into the history of Middle-earth. - The Original Soundtrack application so you can listen to the game soundtrack whenever you want. - The Art Exhibition application that takes you behind the scenes of the game creation process with lots of sketches and development secrets. The Lord of the Rings: Gollumâ„¢ is an official adaptation based on the literary works of J.R.R Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose… How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring â„¢, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dÃ»r and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself… or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn't break; he bends, he adapts… Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It's up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1516/cec5fbb61cd4453f65ef3a79fd63af8b8b7548cb22c91c4f.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG00DELUXE00001","80%","0","Adventure","249.9","null","null","The Lord of the Rings: Gollumâ„¢ - Precious Edition","TRD","NACON SA","2023-05-25","the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-precious-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2499.00","0","499.80","1","",

You begin to sense an eerie feeling of fear in the air, but your skin crawls as you realize it's your own...What was that thing? Again and again you shoot, battling more strange beasts; all grotesque mutations of creatures you once knew. Suddenly the inexplicable becomes clear. Time channels have formed in the Earth's atmosphere, turning once normal life forms into something they were never meant to be. As part of a special commando unit, you must not only ward off and eradicate the beasts, but destroy the time channels to finally rid the Earth of these deadly mutations. GAMEPLAY Along with a heart-pounding adventure through the Corridors of Time and the satisfaction of ripping limbs from hideous monsters with the iconic BladeGun, and an innovative weather system, the player will now be able to enjoy this late 90’s FPS classic with full 4K support, improved sound design, achievements, and localized into twelve languages. - Blow off monsters' limbs even as they continue to attack with remaining appendages - Different effects including water, rain, snow, wind, smoke, dust, sparks, explosions and distant fades - Awesome array of weapons, including unique Blade Gun - Enhanced graphics - Improved sound design","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0416/59f133fd6707350df7c628ce88d02f87f1033573cf166d16.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7947-PPSA13990_00-0322394884056756","60%","0","Action, Shooter","237.66","null","null","Chasm: The Rift","TRD","SNEG Ltd","2023-05-18","chasm-the-rift-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","279.60","1","",

It features a team of skilled warriors from all over the world who have been sent on a mission to defeat the ever-growing numbers of Ink Beasts. A World Blackened By The Ink Of Ruin The story is set in Ido, city of the morning moon, which continues to fight against the disaster known as the ‘Ink of Ruin.’ The city has a very traditional culture similar to medieval Japan and is essentially a fortress, with its protection coming from a strong magical technology boundary. This boundary resonates directly below the moon shining overhead, keeping everyone safe from being tainted. Will You Take Up This Quest? Tokinokuni, the city's leader, has commissioned a quest for carefully selected individuals from all over the world, known as ‘Ink Destroyers’, to go to the most dangerous areas. They will use their unique powers to conquer the various ‘Ink Beasts’ that are so feared by the people still left wandering at large. Investigate the labyrinths surrounding Ido and use your strength and strategy to guide your team to victory and ultimately conquer this nightmarish darkness. The Enemies You Must Overcome The Ink Beasts are born from the Ink of Ruin's taint. If the living encounter it, they will go mad, become demons or perish, and if the dead encounter it then they will be resurrected to roam and increase their numbers. Their only goal is to destroy and envelop the land with darkness, so you must overcome their stain to free this world once and for all from their destruction. These Ink Beasts will take on the form of many frightening demons and yokai from Japanese folklore and also raise the dead for their dark army, so be sure to strengthen your will before facing this enemy. Key Features -Uniquely illustrated visuals with hand drawn, jet-black ink brush strokes, very reminiscent of traditional Japanese calligraphy. -6 playable heroes pre-programmed into the game, plus the option to create your own heroes with unique individual stats and abilities. -Frightening enemies based off traditional Japanese folklore and Yokai (ghosts, ghouls and demons). -Turn-based battles with various Ink Beasts in the most dangerous areas. 3 ‘front’ characters to engage and attack and 3 ‘back’ characters to defend, support and parry. -Engaging narrative and overarching story to enjoy the successes of your gameplay and reflect upon your losses too. -Immersive and atmospheric soundtrack based on traditional Japanese music, helping to create a captivating story.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/2414/6Z6MbyGsm7MZF0yxW3Q5wF9h.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4293-CUSA32780_00-LABYPS4SIEE00000","65%","0","Role-Playing","367.15","null","null","Labyrinth of Zangetsu","TRD","PQube Ltd","2023-04-19","labyrinth-of-zangetsu-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","367.15","1","",

"","2024-11-22","A puzzle-platformer set in a dystopian world where the invention of a cloning device has messed things up, big time. Armed with a clone gun and a mighty fine mustache, the chore of saving THE WHOLE OF CIVILIZATION rests on your shoulders. Don’t blow it. Step into an ethically compromised future where cloning technology has wreaked havoc on humanity – and it’s sort of all YOUR fault! As an employee of nefarious megacorp, Infinity Inc., and the inventor of its Quantic Matter Replication Device (aka the QMRD, aka the cause of the world going to hell in a handbasket), it’s up to you to sort out the mess you helped create. Grab your cloning gun and hot-foot it through a world descending into clone-induced chaos. Create clones of yourself and use them to solve puzzles and save humanity. Get to it genius! Key Features: Create clones! Make endless copies of yourself with the cloning gun and use your perfectly formed doppelgangers – up to four at once – to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles Sacrifice clones! Dystopias are very dangerous places, and many clones will suffer hilariously gruesome deaths along the way. Fried! Crushed! Mangled! Minced! RIP clones :( Explore a world of weirdness! From suspiciously friendly AI and cultish crackpots, to modified corn and cloned panda bears. This freaky future has (almost) everything! Think about ethics! Is it better that a clone should die, rather than the real you? Consider the morality of human cloning as you condemn countless versions of yourself to death Have a mustache! Play as a hero with sweet facial hair. Purely cosmetic.

"","2024-11-22","A grim new threat looms over The Central Kingdoms. The borders protected by the fierce King’s Knights are no longer secure. The fearsome orc clans, more numerous than ever, lurk on all roads. The proud nomadic peoples of the steppes are on the alert, for strange beasts prowl the darkness. Not even the stout dwarves, hidden in their underground palaces, seem safe from threat - from the unknown tunnels of its mines, a foul army of hideous creatures advances inexorably. Chaos seizes the World. Only the memory of the oldest recalls the exploits of a hero and a few warriors, who in other times fought against the forces of Chaos. Ianna, the mother of all living beings, gave the hero a powerful sword to enter the abyss and defeat evil. But that happened a long time ago. A new hero is needed, a chosen one who is worthy to wield the Sword and destroy the enemy... this time forever. FOUR PLAYABLE CHARACTERS. Pick your Champion of Ianna — Tukaram, the Barbarian; Naglfar, the Dwarf; Sargon, the Knight; or Zoe, the Amazon — each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and fighting skills, as you hack ‘n slash your way through a blood-drenched quest to save the world from the forces of Chaos. BLOODY & GORY COMBAT. Learn devastating combo attacks and use them to slice your opponents into pieces. Hack off your foes’ limbs, then use them as weapons! A DETAILED & DARK FANTASY WORLD. Battle orcs, trolls, golems, demons, skeletons, and scores of malevolent enemy creatures as you explore treacherous tombs, frozen fortresses, demon spires, deserts, temples, and palaces. INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS. Destroy in-game objects with fire or your fists as you solve puzzles and disarm traps that combine physics, hydraulic systems, and lethal traps! RE-RELEASE OF A TRUE GENRE-DEFINING GAME. We are happy to bring Blade of Darkness back to life, an enduring classic that, at the time of its release, inspired many games in the action-adventure genre through its approach to combat. With this edition, we've re-engineered the game to work on modern hardware, added widescreen support up to 4K resolution, introduced new display settings, and improved its overall stability. At the same time, the gameplay, content, and the story are untouched — featuring all the game’s quirks and charm.","2024-11-07","/game/99229","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0117/4f123e11ed38cfb43db76a43cdf63ca4ea29e21d743f0ff1.png?w=200","16","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7947-PPSA10819_00-1907741267813674","50%","27","Role Playing Games, Action","210","null","null","Blade of Darkness","TRD","SNEG Ltd","2023-03-15","blade-of-darkness-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","20","262.50","1","",

After you have played around a little and enjoyed the sensation of flying you start to discover the nearby areas and hidden secrets and find a couple of different items. For once there are energy potions which fill your energy meter to continuously fly faster until you run out of energy. Secondly there are golden flowers hidden everywhere in the levels that you can collect as a reward for exploring even the more hidden parts of the levels – collecting all of them unlocks an extra achievement in each level. Last but not least there are the bright shining knowledge shards that show you the way into the next area. Whenever you collect one the next one will spawn ahead of you and show you the right way. Once you have found a certain amount of knowledge shards you will be able to enter the next area and the story continues. Each area is another part of a world that a bee could experience and a little step further to find a new home.

But Aurora will not be alone in her journey: she will have the help of her faithful Lackey, a roboto that has been with her since she was a child, as well as friends and other people she will meet during her travels, while facing the dangerous Brainless, deformed versions without conscience or intelligence of the peaceful robotos and which, for some reason, seem to want to prevent Aurora from completing her goal. In the game we will control Aurora as we travel through different regions and collect clues about the whereabouts of her father: William. The Brainless will try to stop Aurora, however she will be able to confront them thanks to the Copernicus, a revolver custom-made from parts of an old telescope by Rachmaninoff, an old scientist who also supports her and will help her along her journey. And since traveling is not free, Aurora will have to work to earn some money, in one of the two mini-games that represent her part-time jobs. Join Aurora and the Lackey on their journey and take part in the discovery of her father's destiny, and in the process unravel the mystery of the Eureka ship. Features: - Travel through a world full of colorful scenarios and characters. - Interact with the characters to discover the whole story of Aurora. - Complete fun mini-games to save money and improve your weapons.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/2518/PVlxjEunjQDnX0MaF9TFrljG.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0811-CUSA27717_00-0661744383659331","70%","0","Shooter, Adventure","209.7","null","null","Aurora’s Journey: Lackey Edition","TRD","GAMMERA NEST SL","2023-01-12","auroras-journey-lackey-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","209.70","1","",

"","2024-11-22","In this narrative-driven, third-person survival horror game set 300 years in the future, the player will take on the role of Jacob Lee – a victim of fate thrown into Black Iron Prison, a maximum-security penitentiary located on Jupiter's moon, Callisto. When inmates begin to transform into monstrous creatures, the prison is thrown into chaos. To survive, Jacob must battle his way to safety to escape Black Iron Prison, while uncovering the dark and disturbing secrets buried beneath the surface of Callisto. Using a unique blend of shooting and close-quarters combat, Jacob will need to adapt his tactics to combat the rapidly evolving creatures while scavenging to unlock new weapons, gear, and abilities to outrun the growing threat and escape the horrors of Jupiter's Dead Moon. HORROR ENGINEERING The Callisto Protocol is a next-generation take on survival horror from the mind of Glen Schofield. Blending atmosphere, tension, and brutality with terrifying moments of helplessness and humanity, The Callisto Protocol immerses players in a pulse-pounding story where unspeakable horrors lurk around every corner. UNCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE UNITED JUPITER COMPANY Set on Jupiter’s dead moon Callisto in the year 2320, The Callisto Protocol casts players as Jacob Lee, an inmate in Black Iron Prison. When a mysterious outbreak throws the moon into chaos, Jacob must face his darkest fears to defeat the bloodthirsty creatures that stalk him as he unravels the dark mysteries at the heart of the powerful United Jupiter Company. MASTER BRUTAL, STRATEGIC COMBAT The Callisto Protocol challenges players to master a thrilling blend of hand-to-hand and ranged combat, including a unique gravity weapon once used by Black Iron guards to control the prison population. Players will be forced to get up close and personal with their grotesque opponents, hacking off limbs, blasting off legs, and getting creative with whatever is at their disposal to survive each life-or-death encounter. EXPERIENCE THE ISOLATION OF JUPITER'S DEAD MOON One of the most hostile, isolated environments in the universe, Callisto looms large over Jacob’s desperate struggle to survive. Players must not only contend with the horrors of Black Iron Prison, but also the centuries-old secrets that plague Jupiter’s long-dead moon, both above and below the surface.","2024-11-07","/game/85967","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202206/0222/pqZVlL42HwbUMdSAyNQoRnzg.png?w=200","10","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5262-PPSA03352_00-9436657797426872","70%","15","Horror","999999","null","null","The Callisto Protocolâ„¢","TRD","KRAFTON, Inc.","2022-12-02","the-callisto-protocol-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2499.00","11","749.70","1","",

"","2024-11-22","Play out a Kaiju movie as the mayor of Floatio city, tasked with holding off the overwhelming strength of a Kaiju attack with (hopelessly) outclassed military. Defend your city as five unique and devastating Kaiju grow in power with every attack. Unfortunately, they can't be killed, but can be slowed down and forced to fall back... for now. Monsters move towards the nearest building, and the scientists have mathed the exact odds of where they might go next. Build sacrificial army bases and airfields to distract the Kaiju. If standard methods aren't enough, deploy experimental weapons such as freeze rays and transforming mechas to keep them at bay. Or you can always park tanks and jets in the monsters’ path to slow them down (don't worry, we have a good insurance policy). If all your efforts fail, don't be ashamed and run away! Be prepared to evacuate the laboratory using transport trucks, boats, or planes when the Kaiju get too close. Play missions from all over the world as you progress through the fight against Kaiju in a 15+ hour story-based campaign. Throughout the campaign, you’ll have the chance to gain an advantage with upgradeable ACE units and Project Deck customization. Test your wits in tactical puzzles, command dozens of units in large-scale scenarios, and fend off repeated attacks in defense missions while developing your city economically. And if you’re hungry for more, test your command skills in weekly challenges! Features: Protect your city in a tactical battle with cannon-fodder tanks, jets, and more... unusual firepower. Face five different Kaiju - each with unique skills and potential for mutation. Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Do everything to stop the monsters, including sacrificing your units and buildings. Remember that you can’t kill Kaiju - you can only slow them down. Defend cities around the world in 15+ hours of campaign mode. Prove your command capabilities in weekly challenges.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202210/0313/kJJT6eZ2XQEGcGnoEGuKgzh6.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA33612_00-1692968410657931","60%","0","Strategy","244.65","null","null","Kaiju Wars","TRD","Klabater","2022-11-10","kaiju-wars-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","279.60","1","",

"","2024-11-22","Meet Tanuki, a rad longboarding raccoon from Sunset Island. They may just be a raccoon, but they’re a raccoon with a dream—to land on the cover of FISH, the #1 longboarding magazine in the world! Master the longboard as you drift through stunning mountain ranges, swerve through bustling city streets, and board along the sandy beaches of Sunset Island. Train Tanuki to perform epic tricks, from jumping off ramps to longboarding backwards. Sounds easy, right?

Collect Tanuki Bits along the way to keep Tanuki fed and to upgrade your gear at Bob's Skate Shop. If Tanuki’s going to be on the cover of FISH, they need some cool threads for the occasion.

"","2024-11-22","Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, in most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-GASSTATIONSIM0EU","30%","0","Simulation","454.35","null","null","Gas Station Simulator","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2022-10-19","gas-station-simulator-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","489.30","1","",

"","2024-11-22","The town of Moonbury has always been wary of the advances of the outside world, preferring to rely on their traditional methods of healing. Until one day, when the mayor's daughter falls ill, and the local witch doctor can do nothing to help her, they are forced to look outside their small community for help. The Medical Association decides to send their most accomplished chemist - you - to help cure the mayor's daughter and convince the residents of Moonbury of the wonders of modern alchemy. Gain their trust and tend to each person when they fall ill in this open-ended sim RPG. Take care of residents. Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed. Diagnose symptoms and find a cure! Hmm... a low heart rate and a bloated liver. Shoulder cramps, perhaps? No, these are sure signs of burning lungs. This patient has been consuming too much gelatin! Easily remedied; you'll just need to craft some Minty Goblet. Gather ingredients out in the world. Once you've decided on a potion, ointment, or salve, gather ingredients from the surrounding environment using your tools. Upgrade your hammer, axe, and sickle for new swings and attacks to help with your day-to-day tasks. Watch out for changing weather conditions! You may find yourself caught out in the rain, a freezing blizzard, or even the baking heat of a desert. Confront nasty monsters for their materials. Sometimes you won't be able to gather the materials you need as easily as harvesting a berry bush, and you'll need to turn your trusty tools into weapons to collect materials from the monsters prowling the nearby wilderness. Combat is in real-time and, since you're a chemist, you'll be able to brew various concoctions to buff yourself or inflict status ailments on your adversaries, as well as various tools to aid you. Brew remedies in your cauldron. The ingredients you gather can be mixed in your cauldron to brew medicine, vitamins, and more. As you become more experienced, higher-level recipes will become available, requiring more ingredients but bestowing stronger effects. Enhance your cauldron to concoct more ingredients into your recipes for these more advanced remedies. Build relationships with the townsfolk. It'll take a little while, but your patients' health will be much better thanks to your efforts. Your reputation with them will increase, and they'll open up to you a little more. You may even find yourself growing particularly close to certain bachelors or bachelorettes. Upgrade the town and surrounding areas. Building relationships with townsfolk increases your approval rating, allowing you to improve public buildings and expanding the explorable areas around the town. You can also craft and buy new furniture to give your home a personal touch! Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. In the downtime between treating the community's ailments, you'll be able to freely explore in and around Moonbury. Get to know the inhabitants a little better, take a rest in the tavern, or go fishing to catch something for dinner. Moonbury is a delightfully charming location where time seems a little slower and life is just a little more relaxed than the big city. While the lighting will change throughout the day, with the bright sun streaking across the meadows in the morning and street lamps illuminating the town in the early evening, there are no time limits for game objectives. Spend time with a faithful companion. You didn't relocate to Moonbury alone! With you every step of the way is your loyal dog companion. Your pet can help you locate hidden items and point you in the direction of residents as they go about their day.","2024-11-07","/game/85618","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1514/macP3Eb2PKvBNNY2LhFNlzFx.png?w=200","20","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4293-PPSA02687_00-POTIONPERMITSIEE","55%","33","Role-Playing","314.55","null","null","Potion Permit","TRD","PQube Ltd","2022-09-21","potion-permit-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","28","314.55","1","",

"","2024-11-22","On the eve of the gift-giving holiday White Day, new Yeondu High School student, Lee Hee-min, sneaks into school to hide a box of candies for the girl of his dreams. But when the shutters slam shut, he finds himself trapped in the building overnight, hunted by killer janitors and haunted by the troubled souls of the dead. Can Hee-min remain hidden while searching for clues to uncover the dark secrets of the building’s past? Or will the horrors that stalk the school’s eerie hallways by night claim his life before he can escape? With no weapons and limited supplies, there’s little room for error in this tense, stealth-based, Korean Horror classic, brimming with secrets, branching stories, and multiple endings. • Classic horror for a new generation – A contemporary reimagining of the notorious 2001 first-person Korean survival horror, considered by many to be one of the scariest games ever made. All-new visuals and audio effects, an additional playable character in Yoo Ji-min, reimagined ghosts, and special endings. • Suspenseful cat-and-mouse gameplay – Explore a dense network of rooms and hallways by candlelight, while evading the murderous janitors who patrol them. Stay out of sight, turn out the lights, and try not to make a sound! • Terrifying ghost encounters – Come face-to-face with 20 unique ghosts, each more horrifying than the last. Collect ghost stories to learn more about their chilling and often tragic origins. • Mind-bending puzzles – Collect key items, solve devious riddles, and race against the clock to save your friends. Beware as the solution to puzzles will change in every playthrough! • Traditional survival horror mechanics – Inventory management, resource-based save points, limited healing items, and instant game over events to keep you on the edge of your seat! • Multiple endings – Discover other students trapped in the school and interact with them by picking from branching dialogue options. Your choices and actions will significantly alter the outcome of the story, with 10 different endings possible. • Dynamic scare system – Adjust the game’s difficulty for an entirely new experience. Play on Hard and Hell modes to set a time limit, ramp up the scares and ghost activity, with hauntings ready to spring when you least expect it. • Bonus costume DLC included! – 30+ additional costumes unlocked for all characters, from alternative school uniforms to bathing suits!","2024-11-07","/game/29441","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202206/0916/XkP7359JxwP68PWFZptgw5eH.png?w=200","8","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4293-PPSA07972_00-WHITEDAY1EU00000","85%","22","Horror, Action, Adventure","157.35","null","null","White Day: A Labyrinth Named School","TRD","PQube Ltd","2022-09-07","white-day-a-labyrinth-named-school-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","14","157.35","0","",

"","2024-11-22","Before he was the world’s greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naivetÃ© of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise.

DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. Deluxe Edition Content: • Unique Weapon: Transtar Trencher (PS5 Exclusive) • Unique Weapon: Eat The Rich Tribunal • Unique Weapon: .44 Karat Fourpounder • Character Skin: ""Party Crasher"" Colt • Character Skin: ""Sharp Shooter"" Julianna • Two Trinkets (equippable buffs) • Original Game Soundtrack Selections (*FORMATTED USB STORAGE DEVICE REQUIRED TO ACCESS AND PLAY SOUNDTRACK) DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane’s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself.

"","2024-11-22","Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg is a turn-based strategy set in the period of WW2. It brings a modern look and new features to a good old wargame genre. You are to lead the German Armed forces overcoming unthinkable odds and claiming the ultimate bittersweet victory in Europe. Blitzkrieg is the way! The game is created with great care and attention to historical details. The cinematics before and after every operation add depth and immersion into the events unfolding before your eyes. Moreover, some primary and secondary objectives allow you to explore every scenario in detail. The gameplay is plot-driven and features many historical personalities such as Franz Halder, Heinz Guderian, Erich von Manstein, Erwin Rommel, Karl DÃ¶nitz, Wilhelm Canaris, Hermann GÃ¶ring, and others. Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg is the second installment in the Strategic Mind line of games. While “The Pacific” was more about naval warfare, the “Blitzkrieg” brings us all into the continental battles fought by the German troops. Key features: - You will have the opportunity to command ground, air, and naval forces with an emphasis on land battles. - Modern 3D graphics brought by UE4 engine with detailed models of all the units, day/night cycle, and weather effects. - You can upgrade and customize your troops by leveling them up and selecting skills that best suit your strategy. Moreover, you can equip your troops with additional equipment for each operation to better suit both your strategy and the war theatre. - You will gain some awards throughout the game and get access to unique HQ skills, which you can learn to increase the efficiency and synergy of your troops. - You can acquire new units of various types, or upgrade your existing ones. All new units and equipment are available at historically accurate moments of the campaign. - You can take numerous trophies and use some of the enemy`s most advanced units against him in future battles. - While we strive for historical accuracy, we also allow you to explore various “what if’s” and see what could have happened should the German Armed forces be even more successful in their struggle for dominance over the European continent. - Storytelling cinematics, as well as in-operation dialogues with a full voice-over, will help you get a better feeling of the epochal events.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/9u2srtPwzxw8Yyzib0192ZZA.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA28127_00-3331170536439274","65%","0","Strategy","314.7","null","null","Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg","TRD","Klabater","2021-08-05","strategic-mind-blitzkrieg-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","367.15","1","",
"","2024-11-22","Strategic Mind: The Pacific is a turn-based strategy set in the WW2 period depicting the war between the USA and the Empire of Japan waged in the Pacific Ocean with mindblowing historical accuracy and attention to detail. It offers an immersive experience of commanding both sides of the conflict, allowing you to gain a unique understanding of the situation through the eyes of both sides' top commanders, resulting in enjoyable and insightful gameplay. Build up, train, and equip your troops with the newest weaponry available to maximize their efficiency and set sail for victory. The core element of the game is large-scale naval battles with numerous carrier ships bringing so much more aircraft into the battle for seizing control over the ocean. Upon overtaking the sea you will have to set foot on hostile land through a series of costly landing operations. You will have to make your naval, aerial, and amphibious forces act as one flawless mechanism - a task only a truly strategic mind can achieve. Key features: - Play both sides of the conflict to gain a unique insight into the epochal events of the War in the Pacific: the United States of America defending both its global power and its ideals; and the Empire of Japan fighting for the right to take the future of our world into its hands. - You can decide which ships, submarines, and aircraft will constitute the bulk of your force. Manage your fleet between missions with all models becoming available at historically accurate moments. - The unique system of attachments allows customizing your units with additional equipment to increase their efficiency and weave them perfectly into the strategy of your division. - Oversee your units becoming more experienced combatants throughout the campaign and choose which skills they should focus on to better suit your strategy. - A detailed system of naval battles allows you to damage various ship systems, such as all sorts of armament, hull, engine, flight deck, etc. For instance, damaging an enemy ship`s engine will reduce its speed and thus all of its defenses making it easy prey for the rest of your flotilla. - Choose which of the commander’s skills will better suit your strategy and employ them at the right moments to turn the tide of battle. - Modern graphics combined with historically accurate models of all units make the playing experience much more immersive than ever before. - Employ the heroes forged by the furnace of war for the most difficult tasks to ensure the success of the operation. - Witness the events unfold through the plot-driven cutscenes. Intricate combat mechanics allow you to show the full extent of your tactical and strategic superiority.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0713/5I7pyo2bfEVZTeMOsFEVKgRd.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA28129_00-1649502881996412","65%","0","Strategy","314.7","null","null","Strategic Mind: The Pacific","TRD","Klabater","2021-08-05","strategic-mind-the-pacific-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","367.15","1","",

Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race. A new recovery mechanic Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating. The lower the rating, the more the recovery profile penalises the race-day condition.","2024-11-07","/game/109504","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/mDRlUb0UyukoAVgxgkjKZ1CF.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA03340_00-TDF2100000000000","80%","0","Sports","419.8","null","null","Tour de France 2021","TRD","NACON SA","2021-07-01","tour-de-france-2021-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","419.80","0","",

"","2024-11-22","Tannenberg brings the massive battles of the Eastern Front in WW1 to life with 40 players fighting for control of key sectors of the battlefield, each one offering a distinct strategic advantage. Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike. There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series. This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians. Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields. It’s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive – lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Just make sure you don’t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies! The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front), with a new game Isonzo coming soon with mountain warfare on the Italian Front! These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references. **Cross play supported between console platforms.**","2024-11-07","/game/53337","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202002/2812/7lTuF0Wo4f9DT4oMjxx2xks4.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1662-PPSA02756_00-9956598540657310","75%","23","Action, Shooter, Shooter","174.75","null","null","Tannenberg","TRD","BlackMill Games B.V.","2021-06-15","tannenberg-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","21","174.75","1","",
"","2024-11-22","Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man’s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn’t for the faint hearted! Looking for more WW1 action? Check out Tannenberg for Eastern Front maneuver warfare, or the upcoming Isonzo for Italian mountain warfare!","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202012/0822/DTzPcBOwcSWWl5HrVa1d8jYE.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1662-PPSA02758_00-1206800080748220","75%","0","Action, Shooter, Shooter","174.75","null","null","Verdun","TRD","BlackMill Games B.V.","2021-06-15","verdun-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","174.75","1","",

Enjoy a wide range of content The game includes the 19 World Tour teams and their jerseys as well as the teams Alpecin-Fenix, B&B Hotels P/B KTM, Team ArkÃ©a - Samsic and Total Direct Energie. There are also many official races (Paris-Roubaix, Paris-Nice, LBL, etc.) More realistic peloton We have redesigned the actions of riders in the peloton to recreate the behaviour found in real races: -Favourites ride closer to each other - The yellow jersey is better placed at the front of the peloton -Pursuit of the early breakaway is more realistic with fewer teams getting involved, which gives the leader's team the upper hand, just like in real life - Teams that want to catch the breakaway but don't attack or that reduce the peloton in the race on the flat now have consistent behaviour Revamped objectives Before the start of each stage, you can now set the objective for each rider thanks to a new ""Select Rider"" page, which includes all the information you need to make a choice (ranking, role, race-day condition). Your choice obviously influences the behaviour and decisions of riders during the race. A new recovery mechanic Our aim is to offer better visibility of change in condition and to give more importance to riders that recover well in the Grand Tours. Recovery between stages and races is crucial for the success of your riders. In Tour de France 2021 , we have developed a recovery profile based on the recovery rating. The lower the rating, the more the recovery profile penalises the race-day condition.","2024-11-07","/game/109504","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/2611/mDRlUb0UyukoAVgxgkjKZ1CF.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-CUSA27349_00-TDF2100000000000","80%","0","Sports","349.8","null","null","Tour de France 2021","TRD","NACON SA","2021-06-03","tour-de-france-2021-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1749.00","0","349.80","1","",

Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life. ã€ŠMain Featuresã€‹ â–  Exploring with new field actions! Ryza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively. â–  More action-filled real-time battles! Take on your enemies using an improved “real-time tactics” battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever.

Frequently Asked Questions Q: Wait a minute... Is this a sequel to My Name is Mayo? A: Yes. Q: Why would you do such a thing?? A: Isolation in 2020 has been interesting to say the least. Also we couldn’t resist peer pressure. Q: Well, is it a Next-Gen leap for the franchise? A: Huh? Franchise? Well, the graphics are 1080p, 60fps. 1950’s graphic-art inspired. Only the best! Q: Is it better than the original? A: ... Define “better”... Q: Good lord, what does the game even have? A: More of the stuff from the first game! 4 new stories to follow along; 10 more crazy facts to discover; some weird minigames sprinkled throughout; and one messed-up Mayo. Q: Are there at least achievements or something? A: Yup! 50 of them in fact, laid out in a nice card album for you to collect! Q: What’s the gameplay like? Is it still a clicker? A: Yup. Click the Mayo jar and the gameplay will “click” with you right away! “Tap” into the psyche of Mayo and “Mouse-y” along the quirky stories! Q: Please no more puns... A: I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave... (We hope one of you is named Dave)","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/2921/KG9oGKF1Klyo8ZlImKErp9rI.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0305-CUSA25283_00-1464952547287255","30%","0","Simulator","26.97","null","null","My Name is Mayo 2","TRD","Green Lava Studios S.A.","2020-11-16","my-name-is-mayo-2-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","41.50","0","29.05","1","",

"","2024-11-22","Going Under is a satirical dungeon crawler about exploring the cursed ruins of failed tech startups. As an unpaid intern in the dystopian city of Neo-Cascadia, you’ll wield office junk as weaponry as you make your way through the offbeat procedural dungeons beneath your company campus. [The Future is Wack] Failed businesses no longer just cease to exist--they sink beneath the earth, and their employees are cursed to wander the halls for eternity as monsters. It’s your duty to put these monsters out of their misery and repossess their assets--so that your boss can afford a new car, or something. [Not All Heroes Get Paychecks] Battle through the remains of failed startups themed off of gig workers, dating sites, and cryptocurrency. Uncover the true motives of your employer, a carbonated drink startup known as Fizzle, and their parent company, a subscription box manufacturer with an army of helpful shipping drones. Make friends with your co-workers! Hire a freelance goblin! Date a slime! Invest in crypto! Set a rideshare on fire! [Fight Flexibly] In the dungeons of Going Under, almost everything can be used as a weapon, from laptops to brooms to body pillows. Proper weapons can be found as well, but even they can break at a moment’s notice if you aren’t careful. Playing cautiously and picking the right weapon for the situation are musts if you intend on surviving your internship. [Horrible Bosses] And you thought your boss was a monster. At the bottom of the dungeons lurk the founders of the cursed startups, getting rich off of investments while their employees fight amongst themselves. Defeat them and return to the surface with their enchanted relics to empower the company you work for. [Get Paid in Experience] As you explore, you’ll encounter powerful Skills that change the way you play. Learn them at the Cafe and they’ll show up in future runs. Use a Skill often enough, and you’ll get it “endorsed” and available to start your expeditions with. Combine multiple Skills for crazy synergies, and you’ll be cleaning house in no time. [A World of Characters] Complete Tasks for your co-workers to gain Clout with them and unlock their unique bonuses. Learn more about Neo-Cascadia, the origins of Fizzle, and how the drone shipping empire known as Cubicle came to dominate the city. Can you save your company and yourself from going under for good?","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/1114/7dQYlqwdXzOaWtHhDlsh6uwV.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4064-CUSA19050_00-GOINGUNDER000000","75%","0","Action","174.75","null","null","Going Under","TRD","Team 17 Digital LTD","2020-09-23","going-under-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","174.75","1","",

An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers.

Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance. Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.

"","2024-11-22","PLAY FROSTPUNK: CONSOLE EDITION This version of the award-winning game from 11 bit studios is tailored to give console players the full Frostpunk experience: • Thanks to the special, dedicated controller scheme all important features of the game are quickly within your reach. • The Console Edition of the game already includes all the updates that have been released since its premiere on PC. THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.","2024-11-07","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000","80%","0","Strategy, Simulation, Strategy","0","null","null","Frostpunk: Console Edition","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2019-10-10","frostpunk-console-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","209.80","1","",

"","2024-11-22","Daydreamer: Awakened Edition is the story of the last human who rouses from an eternal sleep to an unfamiliar Earth. Aliens took over the planet thousands of years ago, and the nameless protagonist was kept in a stasis chamber as a twisted relic to memorialize their victory. However, the mysterious Immortal Gate Keeper liberates her and sets her on a dangerous expedition to the Earth’s core. Be warned though—the aliens will do whatever it takes to get their trophy back, and the Earth is filled with frightening creatures that hunger for human flesh. Shoot your way through the hauntingly beautiful remains of Earth. Created by Roland Studios, a one-man indie development house, Daydreamer is a homage to 16-bit era side-scrolling shooters. Coupled with strategic platforming, high intensity battles, and pets that aid in combat, you wouldn’t want to wake up from this dream.
