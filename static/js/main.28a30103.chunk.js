Ultimately it\'s a flaming saw blade grounding Goal on Deponia again. By accident, her consciousness gets split into three parts and stored to three different discs. Now it\'s on Rufus once again to convince all three parts of Goal, utilizing his remarkable charming wits, to become one again, venture to Elysium with her and save Deponia from certain doom while he\'s at it.

Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft\'s novella At the Mountains of Madness, but largely set after the original story. You, as Frank Gilman, open your eyes inside a room filled with strange, pulsating noises. Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you\u2019re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near the South Pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister... Explore the Antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues and unlock secrets, whilst avoiding macabre beings at all cost. Key features: A deep and suspense-filled Lovecraftian story with lots of secrets and Easter eggs.

Rife with dark humor, sarcastic quips, and the absurdity of the system. Seemingly built overnight, The Wall has divided both a country in two and a man from his family. To see them again, our ginger-haired protagonist has decided to become a contestant on \u201cThe Wall Show\u201d, a Regime-organized TV show allowing competitors the opportunity to escape to freedom on the other side. However, as he progresses through the camp, our contestant soon realizes exactly how the Regime and the show operate. The promise of freedom is not exactly what it seems. FEATURES * Cinematic platformer: Run, jump, crash, and climb your way through each Arena as the narrative unfolds around you. Much of the story is unveiled via smoothly integrated animation sequences, within the environment, or from NPCs muttering bits of dialogue as you dive and dodge around them. * Environmental HUD: Rather than having a screen cluttered with overlaid indicators, HP bars, and minimaps, any information the player will need is incorporated into the environment. Hints and clues are meshed into the game\u2019s art, subtle and specific, players will need a keen eye if they want to survive each Arena without breaking their legs. * Puzzle-solving: Use your wits, and at times a dash of ruthlessness, to advance through the Arenas.

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn\'t required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don\'t worry if you don\'t know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8Vlv9L9VM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"40%","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.66","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"30.75","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/110363/rogue-bit-switch","RussiaPrice":"112","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"7.22","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"49.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-02-25","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-02-04","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles. Leveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area. Players are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far. The type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animus-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"63%","genre":"Action,Role-Playing,Arcade,Fighting","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"4.80","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"48.10","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"221","Title":"ANIMUS","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"TROOOZE","ReleaseDate":"2019-01-03","Slug":"animus-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"14.05","ChilePrice":"","Price":"7.99","MexicoPrice":"55.13","SalePrice":"2.95"},{"CanadaPrice":"4.06","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-03-03","LowestPrice":"2.95","SaleStarted":"2022-02-10","description":"These are the days before Ire: Blood Memory, the days when Kerr the Breaker\u2019s evil slipped its way into Cadmeia.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself!

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5\'s hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\'s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON\'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\'ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\'ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You\'ll experience DEATHLOOP\'s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom.

The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON    <br />Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay.

There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster.<br /><br />STORY MODE<br /><br />The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episodes 1+2 were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc.<br /><br />EPISODE ONE - \u201cDO NOT GO GENTLE\u201d<br /><br />Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse.<br /><br />EPISODE TWO - \u201cLUMINACE FUGUE\u201d<br /><br />Mackenzie\'s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted?<br /><br />EPISODE THREE - \\"CROSSROADS ELEGY\\"<br /><br />In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that\'s taking them to Perseverance Mills?<br /><br />EPISODE FOUR - \\"FURY, THEN SILENCE\\"<br /><br />A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation?<br /><br />The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released.<br /><br />SURVIVAL MODE<br /><br />Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access.<br /><br />Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game.<br /><br />NO HAND HOLDING<br /><br />The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive.<br /><br />PERMADEATH<br /><br />When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath.<br /><br />CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE<br /><br />Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes.<br /><br />Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Hinterland Studio Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2017-08-01","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202109/2306/ChPARRL6cgDRc3GuWkLZOZIa.png?w=200","Slug":"the-long-dark-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2982-CUSA08624_00-TLDRKFULLGAMEPS4","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmKtKlufjwo","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"70%","Price":34.99,"genre":"Action,Adventure,Simulation,First-Person","SalePrice":10.49,"PlusPrice":10.49,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"79","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/18158/ultimate-chicken-horse-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-02-17 07:59:00","Title":"Ultimate Chicken Horse","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-02-02 09:11:33","description":"Ever wish you were a wall-jumping, arrow-dodging, trap-setting horse, besting your animal pals in a race through a peril-laden obstacle course that you all built together?<br /><br />Wish Granted!<br /><br />Ultimate Chicken Horse is a party platformer where you and your friends build the level as you play, placing deadly traps before trying to reach the end of the level.

You have 25 seconds to execute your action, be it blasting an enemy, manoeuvring your operative, or setting up your next move. After all players have taken turns, the next 25-second round begins. Now you\'ll face what has happened while setting up what will happen. Each of the five rounds is your chance to alter the timeline as past, present, and future converge.<br /><br />A TIME-BENDING TACTICAL SHOOTER<br />With a varied cast of characters to choose from, how you play is up to you. Lay damaging toxic waste in your enemy\'s path, slow time to land the perfect shot, or deploy protective orbs to assist your future self. Every operative possesses a distinctive loadout and special ability that proves decisive on the battlefield.<br /><br />TEAM UP WITH YOURSELF<br />Welcome to the team comprised entirely of one: you. With Lemnis Gate\'s innovative auto co-op feature, you command every member of your side. Auto co-op gives you total control of five deep-space operatives, effectively enabling two competitors to duke it out in bustling ten-character matches. Become a literal one-person army.<br /><br />COUNTLESS POSSIBILITIES, ENDLESS OUTCOMES<br />From the first second to the last, anything can happen in Lemnis Gate. Each round is a fresh chance to implement an unbeatable new strategy \u2013 or earn redemption from an earlier error.

Experiment both in and outside time, and get creative with causality.<br /><br />A HOST OF MODES AND MATCHTYPES<br />Create a match to your preference. Pick between a 1v1 and 2v2 contest, online or offline. Select your mode amongst three thrilling spins on established genre staples. There\'s Retrieve XM, in which you scramble to collect exotic matter and return it to your gate; Domination, which is about competing to capture zones; and Seek & Destroy, where you attempt to wreck your opponent\'s Resistors. Whether teaming up with a friend for \\"hotseat\\" local multiplayer, or pitting your operatives against online rivals, Lemnis Gate lets you set the board to suit your style.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Frontier Developments PLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-08-03","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/2109/3mpvKaCSJ51XRErifM2jD1ou.png?w=200","Slug":"lemnis-gate-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2514-PPSA02803_00-LEMNISGATE000000","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67CpGkrChFw","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"PercentOff":"40%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Strategy,Multiplayer,First-Person","SalePrice":11.99,"PlusPrice":9.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-02-17 07:59:00","Title":"Let\'s Sing 2021","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-02-02 09:10:39","description":"Let the music take control and become the star of your party or sing your heart out solo!

Getting all games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT\'s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem.

Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world. You can be truly free.<br /><br />SUPERHOT<br /><br />Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It\'s just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.<br /><br />SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE<br /><br />Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT\'s signature power fantasy.<br /><br />You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they\'re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched.<br /><br />Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air.
