The methodical combat requires that you plan your attacks, dodges, blocks, and parries while considering your opponents and the environment. Death is permanent but you can improve your stats and purchase items to aid future lives. And if things get too tough then up to four local friends can grab controllers and aid the hero as player-controlled monsters, zombies, and bandits. The World Large, procedurally generated, and interconnected lands range from plains to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons, you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area\u2019s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items. One must choose carefully though; every god has a different price and some become displeased when their rival is the subject of worship. Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians. Variety Scores of weapons, items, spells, and mementos are scattered throughout the world to find. One may acquire a powerful enchanted ballista early into one life, only for the next to yield nothing more than a couple of wooden clubs. Mementos represent objects remembered from past lives and change the rules of gameplay. You may discover a memento that summons spiders from enemy corpses, improves your stats while on fire, or reverses the effects of death. There are multiple paths to victory. One could be nimble and stealthy, charge in waving a hammer, raise an army of undead, harness a variety of spells, manipulate enemies into traps or flames, amass resources to acquire the most powerful items, or simply play it safe with a sword and a shield. The various characters simply offer different starting points, every decision is your own. Challenge No life is predetermined for success. The cheery graphics disguise a brutal and unyielding experience. Unforeseen obstacles will need to be dealt with in real time and even a regular enemy will be deadly if you\u2019re not careful. To reach the end, players will need to demonstrate that they are able to consistently overcome these obstacles. Failure can halt or even reverse progress. As you accumulate experience, discover schematics, and defeat bosses you can become permanently better prepared to tackle future challenges. The choices and advantages a player has at the beginning of a playthrough will dramatically increase as they play. New characters, items, and bonuses are unlocked in ways that are only hinted at during gameplay.","SaleStarted":"2024-04-23","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202402\/2711\/594d0e532892337960f060de798e952ff115296f67d9f613.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP6718-PPSA21627_00-0132056813808815","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":202,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP6718-PPSA21627_00-0132056813808815","PlusPrice":263.2,"Title":"In Celebration of Violence","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Dolores Entertainment S.L.","ReleaseDate":"2024-03-14","Slug":"in-celebration-of-violence-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"329.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"263.20","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-08","LowestPrice":"","description":"STOP10 is an arcade game that mixes fast reflexes with simple sums.

Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what\u2019s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment. DRIVE TO SURVIVE It\u2019s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It\u2019ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You\u2019ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows.

Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is \u2018nothing ventured, nothing gained\u2019 \u2014 some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places.

In this dark fantasy adventure you solve intricate cases and unveil abysmal secrets as Inquistor Mordimer Madderdin. The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality, inspired by the bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Konigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500\u2019s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal \u2018the truth\u2019. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it\u2019s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation. Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy\u2019s weak points against them.","SaleStarted":"2024-04-23","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202209\/2214\/ULouZNFHNgrQorotB3Zre4sC.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP4365-PPSA10961_00-000THEINQUISITOR","MainStory":9,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP4365-PPSA10961_00-000THEINQUISITOR","PlusPrice":599.2,"Title":"The Inquisitor","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Kalypso Media GMBH","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-08","Slug":"the-inquisitor-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"749.00","MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":"599.20","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-08","LowestPrice":"\/game\/71088","description":"Please note that the PS5 version solves the vast majority of issues known from the PS4 edition.

Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as mysterious dangers await. Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria\u2014known as Khazad-dûm or Dwarrowdelf\u2014in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there\u2019s clatter, there\u2019s combat. Excavate the mysteries of three legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within. Key Game Features: ● Feel the Fellowship: Experience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. ● Survive the Dark: To survive the treacherous Mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain. ● Base Building: Find solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to destroy Dwarven progress. ● Rebuild and Reshape Moria: Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dûm to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses. Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources. ● Explore: Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger, providing a unique experience each and every time. ● Co-op Multiplayer: Adventure alone or band together with friends in online cooperative multiplayer. ● Craft Dwarven Tools, Weapons and More: Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor, tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines. ● Uncover Magic Artifacts: Discover ancient magic items including swords that glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom. ● Mine Ore and Jewels: Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril. Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear. But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness. ● Comprehensive Dwarf Builder: Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator. Dwarves can be customized in a variety of ways to create a unique Dwarven identity. Then, during gameplay, players can find and craft armor and weapons to further enhance their unique style.","SaleStarted":"2024-04-23","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202306\/0520\/d7bb0cab42052c1946d6fdcf236f059ee850819f9008843c.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP7581-PPSA16618_00-0277621140622233","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP7581-PPSA16618_00-0277621140622233","PlusPrice":503.2,"OpenCriticURL":"https:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/game\/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria\/critic-reviews\/?platform=playstation-5","Title":"The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"North Beach Games","ReleaseDate":"2023-12-04","Slug":"the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"503.20","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-08","LowestPrice":"\/game\/131935","description":"In ancient times, the land of Isigwere was terrorized by monsters led by Leinad, the Demon Lord.

The great grandpappy of adventure games will test you and tickle your problem-solving skills as you unearth its plot and secrets. Through cunning trial-and-error you will crawl through tight squeezes, encounter impressive caverns, collect inventory, locate treasure, thwart dwarf attacks, all while keeping your eye on the score before your lamp goes out. Dust off your vintage Colossal Cave maps from the 70s or 80s, they'll still work like a charm. This is a faithful, unchanged tribute to the original game design. Developed in the mid-1970\u2019s by amateur cave spelunker, this classic text-adventure was originally crafted as a way for a father to entertain his two young daughters. Will Crowther based his design on detailed cave maps he\u2019d made with his wife, Patricia, of the Bedquilt section of Kentucky\u2019s Mammoth cave. Family cave exploration is at the heart of this game. Shortly thereafter, the code-prankster, Don Woods, discovered the game on the ARPANET and expanded the cave. He layered in more fun, fantasy, puzzles, and a vexing 350-point system. Years later, Don\u2019s expansion became the most accessible and the definitive version of Colossal Cave Adventure. Enter Roberta Williams. She first played the game in 1979 and was instantly hooked. She spent weeks playing the game, taking notes and mapping out the cave, as it was revealed through the textual descriptions in game. Her mind was filled with imaginary neon mushrooms, misty underground lakes, a snappy bivalve mollusk, and a noticeably absent giant. After finishing the game, and all 350 points achieved, she was ready for another adventure \u2013 a dilemma in 1979. If it was another adventure she wanted, she\u2019d have to make her own... and, indeed she did. In 1980 she designed and developed the world\u2019s first graphic computer game, Mystery House. This groundbreaking game is considered one of the most influential in history, establishing conventions that have become standard in the adventure game genre. It has been ported to just about every computer and console, played by millions, and inspired many other games, books, movies, and TV series. Relive the golden age of adventure gaming. Immerse yourself in a timeless exploration through a sprawling cave system filled with treasures, creatures, and brain-teasing puzzles. Transport back to a more innocent time and experience the retro-cool of point-and-click mechanics, accompanied by an art style that harkens back to the golden age of adventure games.

The new tracks will be unlocked as the player progresses through the game's main story, and will represent a real challenge for the most skilled ones! Welcome to Everhood, a bizarre realm located on the edges of space and time. Its inhabitants are a peculiar lot. These otherworldly entities spend their days wandering labyrinthine castles. Clubbing and board games are popular pastimes here, as well. That is, until a gnome steals an arm from Red, the wooden doll. A seemingly simple quest to reclaim it begins to pull at the fraying threads of this strange world, unraveling a mystery and reality in the process. Go on a trip through the doors of perception. Explore fantastical environments in the hunt for the pinched limb. Play hide and seek with animate mushrooms in the forest, win carnival prizes, and race go-karts against colorful characters like mages, sentient save points, robots, and vampires. Learn about Red's past and come ever-closer to finding the Absolute Truths of the Universe. But knowledge often comes at a cost. Some of Everhood's eclectic residents aren't content to let Red roam the realm freely. Face off against challengers ranging from multi-legged monsters to brothers who run a plank-selling business, and the fearsome Gold Pig, in musical battles. Avoid incoming attacks by moving, grooving, and leaping out of harm's way while jamming out to bespoke battle themes as varied as the inhabitants of this curious community. Red's journey is teeming with secrets and world-alerting revelations. As Everhood's true nature begins to appear, adventurers will make decisions that impact Red's role in the fate of everyone \u2013 and everything \u2013 the doll encounters. Experience a twisting story and overcome dance-based trials across five difficulty modes, a range of accessibility options, and an unlockable New Game Plus feature that calls into question everything that's come before it.","SaleStarted":"2024-04-23","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202308\/0912\/44b5e5fa42db6b7623f5681d2cf2a43dccda9426555c84a4.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP7652-PPSA09760_00-EVERHOOD000PS5EU","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"33%","Completionist":21,"genre":"Adventure, Music\/Rhythm","id":"EP7652-PPSA09760_00-EVERHOOD000PS5EU","PlusPrice":220.43,"Title":"Everhood: Eternity Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BlitWorks Publishing, S.L.","ReleaseDate":"2023-09-28","Slug":"everhood-eternity-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"329.00","MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":"220.43","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-08","LowestPrice":"\/game\/126279","description":"The legendary DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai manga and anime arrives as an exhilarating action RPG!

While your mind grapples with memories of your family home and the trenches on the front, you try to break the endless cycle of suffering. BETWEEN A DREAM AND REALITY You wake up in your bedroom, unchanged from your teenage years, in a run-down and deserted manor house. Suddenly and inexplicably, you are transported to the trenches where the horrors of war are overshadowed by vile and even more terrifying creatures. Unable to distinguish between reality and nightmare, you must fight to regain control of your life's narrative. NIGHTMARES THAT BECOME REAL Unspeakable nightmares come to life in the recesses of your mind. To escape the death traps and terrifying creatures, you must understand the source and motivation of each monster and solve the puzzles that stand in your way. From blind demons who can hear your softest footsteps to hideous disjointed puppets who move in the dark, horror is around every corner.

You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood.

Unlocking its power piece by piece, his curiosity soon turned to obsession. Simply studying the tome wasn't enough. Before long, he used his findings to bring the very world to life. Trees, flowers, and mushrooms sprouted legs and maws, yearning for fresh meat. Wild animals were melded with humans and thrown into his labyrinth. The dead arose from the long-forgotten ruins. And in the city corrupted by gold, his tongue poisoned the king's ear. His obsession finally led to a tear in the veil - a portal to another place where untold horrors lurk. Now, they enter our world in droves, razing villages to the ground. These unimaginable events have brought together heroes from across the realm. Heroes like you. From this camp, we will push these creatures back to the beyond and defeat this irredeemable sorcerer. The ultimate tabletop game, unlike anything you have ever seen before!

Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

It features a team of skilled warriors from all over the world who have been sent on a mission to defeat the ever-growing numbers of Ink Beasts. A World Blackened By The Ink Of Ruin The story is set in Ido, city of the morning moon, which continues to fight against the disaster known as the \u2018Ink of Ruin.\u2019 The city has a very traditional culture similar to medieval Japan and is essentially a fortress, with its protection coming from a strong magical technology boundary. This boundary resonates directly below the moon shining overhead, keeping everyone safe from being tainted. Will You Take Up This Quest? Tokinokuni, the city's leader, has commissioned a quest for carefully selected individuals from all over the world, known as \u2018Ink Destroyers\u2019, to go to the most dangerous areas. They will use their unique powers to conquer the various \u2018Ink Beasts\u2019 that are so feared by the people still left wandering at large. Investigate the labyrinths surrounding Ido and use your strength and strategy to guide your team to victory and ultimately conquer this nightmarish darkness. The Enemies You Must Overcome The Ink Beasts are born from the Ink of Ruin's taint. If the living encounter it, they will go mad, become demons or perish, and if the dead encounter it then they will be resurrected to roam and increase their numbers.

You have to perform increasingly complex tasks in prison, balancing the administration's assessment and inmates' satisfaction. In the game, you play the role of a prison guard and it is only up to you whether you decide to obey the law or let this place and people corrupt you completely. After all, who said you had to be an exemplary ranger? Maybe you prefer to trade with prisoners, help them smuggle, and bet on the outcome of fights in prison instead? After all, everyone likes to have fun sometimes. Especially in a sad place like this, where you are also the boss. Or at least you think so. So how? Will you choose to follow the rules, intercept contraband, count prisoners, send them to work, take care of their basic needs and keep prison gangs under control? Will you go to the dark side? Whatever you decide, remember that your actions will affect both the facility itself and the inmates, and above all, the further course of your career. Unique features of the game: - try to balance between following the orders of your superiors and doing small favors for the inmates. In doing so, you will maintain a fragile balance between both and benefit from the gratitude of both parties, - become the exemplary prison guard in campaign mode. Receive new prisoners, search cells for contraband for confiscation, view surveillance footage, maintain peace and order, react to inmates' acts of disobedience, and complete many other tasks assigned by your superiors, - or ignore all rules in Free Play mode. Do what you want, discover the farthest corners of the prison, explore the surroundings and interact with prisoners. Just remember that your every action will have an impact not only on other prison guards but also on the inmates themselves. Especially if you choose to punish the latter frequently and for no apparent reason.","SaleStarted":"2024-04-23","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202301\/2414\/RtjAgzTaTOQtewsEl4fj9MTG.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP1549-CUSA37735_00-CLABS1PS20221231","MainStory":10,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Role Playing Games, Simulator","id":"EP1549-CUSA37735_00-CLABS1PS20221231","PlusPrice":249.5,"Title":"Prison Simulator","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PlayWay plc","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-03","Slug":"prison-simulator-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"499.00","MainExtra":15,"SalePrice":"249.50","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-05-08","LowestPrice":"\/game\/24010","description":"In Raiden IV x MIKADO remix, you'll continue the fight against the extraterrestrial race known as the Crystals in their attempt to take over the world.

Until one day, when the mayor's daughter falls ill, and the local witch doctor can do nothing to help her, they are forced to look outside their small community for help. The Medical Association decides to send their most accomplished chemist - you - to help cure the mayor's daughter and convince the residents of Moonbury of the wonders of modern alchemy. Gain their trust and tend to each person when they fall ill in this open-ended sim RPG. Take care of residents. Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed. Diagnose symptoms and find a cure! Hmm... a low heart rate and a bloated liver. Shoulder cramps, perhaps? No, these are sure signs of burning lungs. This patient has been consuming too much gelatin! Easily remedied; you'll just need to craft some Minty Goblet. Gather ingredients out in the world. Once you've decided on a potion, ointment, or salve, gather ingredients from the surrounding environment using your tools. Upgrade your hammer, axe, and sickle for new swings and attacks to help with your day-to-day tasks. Watch out for changing weather conditions! You may find yourself caught out in the rain, a freezing blizzard, or even the baking heat of a desert. Confront nasty monsters for their materials. Sometimes you won't be able to gather the materials you need as easily as harvesting a berry bush, and you'll need to turn your trusty tools into weapons to collect materials from the monsters prowling the nearby wilderness. Combat is in real-time and, since you're a chemist, you'll be able to brew various concoctions to buff yourself or inflict status ailments on your adversaries, as well as various tools to aid you. Brew remedies in your cauldron. The ingredients you gather can be mixed in your cauldron to brew medicine, vitamins, and more. As you become more experienced, higher-level recipes will become available, requiring more ingredients but bestowing stronger effects. Enhance your cauldron to concoct more ingredients into your recipes for these more advanced remedies. Build relationships with the townsfolk. It'll take a little while, but your patients' health will be much better thanks to your efforts. Your reputation with them will increase, and they'll open up to you a little more. You may even find yourself growing particularly close to certain bachelors or bachelorettes. Upgrade the town and surrounding areas. Building relationships with townsfolk increases your approval rating, allowing you to improve public buildings and expanding the explorable areas around the town. You can also craft and buy new furniture to give your home a personal touch! Enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside. In the downtime between treating the community's ailments, you'll be able to freely explore in and around Moonbury. Get to know the inhabitants a little better, take a rest in the tavern, or go fishing to catch something for dinner. Moonbury is a delightfully charming location where time seems a little slower and life is just a little more relaxed than the big city. While the lighting will change throughout the day, with the bright sun streaking across the meadows in the morning and street lamps illuminating the town in the early evening, there are no time limits for game objectives. Spend time with a faithful companion. You didn't relocate to Moonbury alone! With you every step of the way is your loyal dog companion. Your pet can help you locate hidden items and point you in the direction of residents as they go about their day.","SaleStarted":"2024-04-23","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202208\/1514\/macP3Eb2PKvBNNY2LhFNlzFx.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP4293-PPSA02687_00-POTIONPERMITSIEE","MainStory":20,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":34,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP4293-PPSA02687_00-POTIONPERMITSIEE","PlusPrice":299.4,"Title":"Potion Permit","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PQube Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-21","Slug":"potion-permit-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"499.00","MainExtra":28,"SalePrice":"299.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-05-08","LowestPrice":"","description":"Customise your room with: Potion Permit Small Fairy Spring Excalibur Wooden Bear Statue Capital Chemist Equipment White Cat Aquarium Pirate Ship Model Miniature Blimp Vending Machine Capital Antique Clock Giant Noxe Plush Doll Animal Plushies","SaleStarted":"2024-04-23","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202208\/1116\/W0gQYj3jl9zzp2mnpJYqCmaO.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP4293-PPSA02687_00-POTIDELUXPS5SIEE","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role Playing Games, Puzzle, Simulation","id":"EP4293-PPSA02687_00-POTIDELUXPS5SIEE","PlusPrice":377.4,"Title":"Potion Permit: Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"PQube Ltd","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-21","Slug":"potion-permit-deluxe-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"629.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"377.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-05-08","LowestPrice":"","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game.

MEET THE CHICKEN POLICE Sonny Featherland and Marty MacChicken were once a legendary detective-duo, called the Chicken Police.

You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue! Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor.

Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You\u2019ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\u2019ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows? Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\u2019ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You\u2019ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it. Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you'll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.","SaleStarted":"2024-04-23","Image":"https:\/\/image.api.playstation.com\/vulcan\/ap\/rnd\/202010\/1322\/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png?w=200","URL":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/en-tr\/product\/EP3236-PPSA04698_00-5793122806301854","MainStory":9,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":14,"genre":"Horror","id":"EP3236-PPSA04698_00-5793122806301854","PlusPrice":527.4,"OpenCriticURL":"https:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/game\/visage\/critic-reviews\/?platform=playstation-4","Title":"VISAGE","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SadSquare Studio Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-10","Slug":"visage-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https:\/\/shope.ee\/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"879.00","MainExtra":12,"SalePrice":"527.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"77","SaleEnds":"2024-05-08","LowestPrice":"\/game\/98557","description":"\"As the last summer day fades, all is illuminated.\" With gorgeous translucent designs by Mel Kishida, as well as a story that depicts the youth of lifelike girls, based on a theme of human identity and bonding, a new title in the BLUE REFLECTION series is here! Story Under a piercing blue sky, surrounded by crystal clear water, the sun scorched Ao Hoshizaki's skin. Gazing at the summer scenery, it seemed as if the girl was left behind in a world that she had wandered into. At a school adrift in the distance, there lived three girls who had lost their memories. The only thing they could remember was their names. Ao, shrouded in confusion, begins to lead a strange communal life with the girls as they seek clues about a way to return to their original world. One day, in this world where the school was surrounded by nothing but water, a path that led to new scenery suddenly appeared. At the end of the path was a mysterious location, where familiar things existed inexplicably. In order to grasp the situation, the girls decided to venture forward, but as soon as they took their first steps, they encountered a monster they had never seen before. But just when they thought things had become hopeless, the girls obtain a mysterious power. In a world that seemed to be trapped in summer, young girls have lost their memories. If the girls solve the mystery, what will they obtain? Features ■Make your very own school with \"School Development\"! The girls are the only ones at the school surrounded by water.

The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won\u2019t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King\u2019s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter\u2019s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King\u2019s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose. \u2022 The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty.

Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies.
