Make your time on the island your own and experience the adventure at your own pace. No rush<br />- A place you want to stay. We based this on our childhood summers and, well, we wish we could go back. This island is the next best thing<br />- Honestly, a feel-good game about running around and doing good deeds<br /><br />Features:<br />- Handcrafted visuals. Every little corner of the island has been looked after with great detail. Trust me, it took us a while to make it<br />- Join Alba and Ines to found the AIWRL (really rolls off the tongue doesn't it?), an organisation that can save the island<br />- You will need to gather a bunch of volunteers and the town is full of good people. Help them out and inspire them to join you<br />- There are animals everywhere, can you find all the species?",

Then everyone - even an audience of potentially thousands – tries to guess the REAL answer.<br /><br />Drawful 2 includes new features like the ability to add your own user generated prompts to make even crazier custom games with your friends, as well as expanded tools for streaming including censoring players.<br /><br />Drawful 2 is a go-to party game that everyone can play and enjoy!<br /><br />NOTE: Drawful 2 is in English only.<br />NOTE: This game is local multiplayer, but can be enjoyed over streams with remote players.",

The only way to discover Chime is to play it, but if you want a glimpse, consider what it might feel like to cross Tetris, a music sequencer and a hypnotic dream about your favourite pop song.<br /><br />Chime Sharp takes Chime's classic dynamic and updates it for 2017. The core rules are the same but the aesthetic is clean and modern and the game's soundtrack has been completely refreshed. With sixteen new levels, experimental modes, new-era connectivity and sharper ways to play, Chime's finally back -- and it wants to be your new favourite mixtape.",

Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?<br /><br />The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat.<br /><br />Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world.<br /><br />- Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries.<br />- Permadeath. All characters that die in combat will stay dead – unless they return as the undead.<br />- All characters come with their own background stories and traits. Want a stuttering ratcatcher, a greedy witch hunter or a drunkard disowned noble?<br />- Character development without a restrictive class-system. Each Character gains experience through combat, can level up and acquire powerful perks.<br />- Equipment that matters. Different weapons grant unique skills – split shields with axes, stun enemies with maces, form a spearwall with spears or crush armor with a warhammer.<br />- Diverse enemy roster. All enemies have unique equipment, skills and AI behavior.<br />- A dynamic event system with atmospheric encounters and tough decisions outside of combat.<br />- Three late game crises – a war between noble houses, a Greenskin invasion and an undead scourge – add a looming threat.<br />- Two full hours of orchestral soundtrack.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet.<br /><br />There is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective.<br /><br />ABOUT<br /><br />Backbone is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation.<br /><br />Backbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY<br /><br />Backbone's gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you.<br /><br />As Howard, you will:<br /><br />• Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth <br />• Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be <br />• Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver <br />• Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss <br />• Be a raccoon<br /><br />FEATURES<br /><br />Post-noir dystopia<br /><br />Backbone's Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It's a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better.<br /><br />Stunning visuals<br /><br />The breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic animals.<br /><br />Evocative and unforgettable soundtrack<br /><br />Original doom jazz soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab features an innovative combination of classic jazz and electronic music. Backbone's OST is expertly crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape that serves and enhances storytelling.",

Use it to try and solve our meticulously designed test chambers. The basic principle is as easy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. But be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. They're not exactly what you and I would call “human friendly”.<br /><br />Use the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the chambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using that mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors are more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using door triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.<br /><br />If all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! You're the perfect candidate for our test chambers!<br /><br />That being said, welcome and good luck!",

It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece.<br /><br />For the solo voyager, the ship's computer-controlled cat will keep you company. Without a second pair of hands, Albert will need an extra dose of dexterity to navigate the challenges of Victorian space flight.<br /><br />The mix of action and thoughtful puzzles make 39 Days to Mars perfect for playing in short sessions. The entire adventure fits comfortably into an evening, or a long tea break.<br /><br />The HMS Fearful is ready to embark for Mars!<br /><br />1-2 players<br />380MB minimum save size",

Playing with quantum reality and altering the path of history can have the most unforeseen consequences…<br /><br />Classic Essence / VR Technology<br />Sit in front of the huge 3D Quantum Simulator screen, fasten your seatbelt and relive the magic of legendary vertical scrolling titles.<br />Alternate the “classic” point of view with the first-person perspective while performing impossible maneuvers to dodge enemy fire. Be amazed by the dynamic scenario elements that will pop off at you. Never has a simulation seemed so real and fast-paced.<br /><br />Air Combat / Immersion Zones<br />As Ivanovich Games already did in the successful “Operation Warcade”, all the scenarios in “1976: Back to Midway” include several Immersion Zones, which allow the player to move inside the aircraft cabin, offering new and thrilling challenges. An experience that only Virtual Reality can provide. <br />Take control of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the B-17G Flying Fortress exact replicas, test your pilot skills, become a flying ace, and change history forever.<br /><br />Features:<br />- 16 story-mode levels filled with humor.<br />- 24 immersion zones.<br />- 64 missions.<br />- More than 200 aircraft upgrades.<br />- Tons of action without tutorials or inserting coins; enjoy infinite retries.<br /><br />In addition, on PS5 consoles: PlayStation Camera adaptor for PS Camera is required (no purchase necessary) go to www.playstation.com/camera-adaptor; for the best PlayStationVR experience on PS5 we recommend using a DUALSHOCK4 wireless controller.<br /><br />PlayStation Camera required<br />Enhanced play with 2 PlayStation Move motion controllers<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console",

Actually I have a list of great things to do instead, but today I would love you to join us and play Alexio. This game is a blast among the fans of really hard and challenging titles. You're gonna love it!<br /><br />The premise is simple: this is the game about the little duckling Alex. The day when he turned 6 he learned the hard truth from his father — to become a true drake he had to complete the journey on his own and find his monobrow during his travels. Alex had a hard time trying to get some sleep, because he knew that this journey would be the most exciting thing for him ever. You will have to travel with Alex, overcome a set of obstacles and get through the meadows, lakes, mountains, woods, caves and ancient ruins on your way to the temple that keeps your hard-earned reward.

Get a babysitter for the kids, this game is a madcap, mile-a-minute spree of spies, dives, and gun-toting bad guys that will have you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />You take on the role of Jack, a handsome, jaded former intelligence officer pulled out of his retired life as a strip club regular for one last mission to stop the villainous virologist Krueger, who plans to unleash a mind-controlling virus on the unsuspecting citizens of L.A. Everyone is out to kill Jack now that he's hot on Krueger's trail, and he'll need to use his mind, muscles, and mojo to stay alive long enough to stop Kruger's plot. Your spur-of-the-moment decisions will help or hinder Jack as he tries to find and protect the only scientist who has the cure to counter Krueger's deadly bioweapon.<br /><br />A restoration and remaster of a game lost to time for over 25 years, American Hero was originally designed for the Atari Jaguar CD as a “playable movie” with a groundbreaking, more fluid presentation than the FMV games of its time. The game features the talents of professional actors, including Timothy Bottoms (The Last Picture Show, Johnny Got His Gun), Daniel Roebuck (The Fugitive, Final Destination), and Musetta Vander (O Brother, Where Art Thou, Wild Wild West). For this restoration, Timothy Bottoms reprises his role in newly recorded voiceovers of Jack's inner thoughts heard throughout the game.<br /><br />This restoration was rebuilt from the ground up with new game logic that delivers on the ambitious promise of the original game. This edition of the game includes new voicework from star Timothy Bottoms to accompany the original footage, completing the American Hero experience for the first time.<br /><br />American Hero features:<br /><br />• An explosive and adult-oriented Hollywood production with intense action, spicy encounters, and gut-busting laughs<br /><br />• A winding player-directed plot with multiple paths and endings<br /><br />• A unique FMV format that plays smoothly like watching a film<br /><br />• The return of Hollywood actor Timothy Bottoms as Jack with newly recorded voiceover",

        "description": "Inspired by the award-winning board game franchise, Arkham Horror: Mother's Embrace is an investigation game served with turn-based combat, set in the  haunted worlds of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos. Plunge into an original story written by Fantasy Flight Interactive's official writers and explore the American Roaring Twenties.<br /><br />The year is 1926: a professor of astronomy is found dead in her mansion and everything indicates that she has been the victim of a heinous murder. Choose from 12 intrepid investigators from the Arkham Horror games, each with a unique set of skills, and assemble your team to shed the light over this mysterious death.<br /><br />Find clues, perform interrogations and progress through nine chapters as the story unfolds. Your investigation will take you to visit shadowed institutions and mysterious locales, ranging from Miskatonic University, the Arkham Asylum, and the bayous of Louisiana. <br /><br />As the investigators get closer to their goal, your squad will have to face curious science, living nightmares, and a sinister cult, whose mad scheme is to bring about the end of everything. Use a large variety of melee and ranged weapons, as well as powerful items and devastating magic spells to defeat your opponents in turn-based combat; while you attempt to retain your sanity.<br /><br />As you face off against Lovecraftian horrors, your investigators will descend deeper into the depths of madness, affecting their level of sanity and causing traumas that will impact the course of your investigation. Care about your sanity and make the right choices… the Ancient Ones are preparing their return.",

Each choice you make in the crucial few moments we all know may change our lives for good in a split of a second, influence what kind of person Mitch turns out to be and what values shall guide him once he becomes his own man.<br /><br />Why Are You Who You Are?<br /><br />Find clues as to why Louise's life is what it is today, take crucial decisions no other person would be strong enough to stomach and show Mitch what he needs to see in order for him to become independent, suave and brave enough to conquer the day.<br /><br />Everything Has Consequences<br /><br />Your decisions REALLY matter! To keep track of Mitch's growth as a person, each choice you make adds positive or negative points to three key statistics: Righteousness, Confidence, and Relations. These influence which type of ending Mitch will reach at the end of the game - there are 9 unique endings in total!<br /><br />Everybody Has Their Story<br /><br />The 1960s were tumultuous in more ways than one - the Summer of Love, the Vietnam War, the survivors and the losers of the great upheaval in history.<br />Canned Heat was “Going Up the Country” while Bob Dylan asked “How does it feel” to have no home and live on the street.<br />Travel across the country and meet a plethora of characters that may help or may dissuade Louise from her goals - including the most controversial groups many thought long gone.<br /><br />Best Month Ever! Official Soundtrack included!<br />It'll Be The Best Month Ever! is a complete collection of 29 beautiful, expressive, folk, country and jazz-inspired melodies prepared by the composer Jędrzej Bączyk (Pan Jędras). The stunning, nearly 80-minute original soundtrack is an excellent addition to the narrative adventure game, creating the musical soundscape of the main characters' journey across the 1960s USA.<br /><br />CONTENT WARNING<br />The game includes scenes and storyline elements that some people may find disturbing and emotionally heavy. It contains offensive language, sexual themes, and allusions to them, a fictional depiction of racism and violence against various groups of people. Player discretion is advised. <br />We have introduced a profanity filter to the game. Due to it being in place, some controversial scenes in the game will be skipped entirely or partially, and vulgar language will be hidden behind the *** wall.<br />The profanity filter can be switched on or off in the Options tab within the Menu.",

        "description": "You find yourself in a room with no exits. Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?<br /><br />If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode!<br /><br />Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play.<br /><br />You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type.<br /><br />The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it. Get your name up there and challenge your friends!<br /><br />The only question that remains is: what's outside the room?<br /><br />PlayStation VR headset compatible<br />PlayStation Camera compatible<br />Enhanced play with 2 PlayStation Move motion controllers<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled",

I love creating simple, fun and well designed games. My biggest inspirations are games from the 8-bit and 16-bit era. I like every aspect in the process of making video games: pixel art, coding, game design and drawing. I've worked on several indie games in the past - Castle Of Pixel Skulls is one of my last solo developed games and it was in development for about one year.<br /><br />Key features:<br /><br />- 4 different chapters with 10 levels each: a total of 40 levels full of madness and challenges!<br /><br />- Dangerous traps and enemies: spikes, fireballs, lava, timed platforms, skeletons, and more!<br /><br />- Timed levels: replay the levels as many times as you want and try to beat your previous score.<br /><br />- Classic arcade platformer playstyle: old school difficulty of classic NES platform titles.<br /><br />- Simple and accessible controls<br /><br />- Easy to play, hard to master",

In the co-op mode, he can use help from his squirrel friend called Swirlz.<br /><br />Thanks to cooperation mode, even the youngest gamers will be able to enjoy George's adventures, playing together with their friends or their sitters. Besides all the arcade fun, Castle on the Coast offers a more serious, moral angle.

George has symbolized the love and care found at Valley Children's there for nearly seven decades. “Adopted” as the hospital's mascot by its five founding mothers, a giraffe was chosen because they have the largest heart of any land mammal. And that heart is present in the care provided at Valley Children's every single day. Now, thanks to the cooperation between Valley Children's, Big Heart Productions, and Klabater, the beloved giraffe will debut in a video game!<br /><br />A magic castle entrenched in conflict. <br />Help George explore the magical Castle on the Coast, home to crystal caverns, stone-laden halls, and trippy alternate dimensions. Seamlessly wander from level to level with no loading screens in a large, interconnected world. All is not well in this land, however. Two powerful wizards bear a grudge against their fellow orphans. Can George bring this family back together again, or will he just get in the way?<br /><br />A cute giraffe with XTREME PARKOUR POWERS!? <br />This giraffe can get anywhere, anytime! String together wall runs, wall jumps, spins, dives, rolls, and more with responsive controls. Carve new paths through levels in a quest to frustrate level designers.

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before!<br /><br />NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY<br />Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games. The game has more than 30 characters to talk to, with some having to be seriously interrogated. Collect tons of clues, evidence, and highly sensitive personal information from the shady characters of Clawville to use ruthlessly against them!<br /><br />EXPLORE THE CITY OF CLAWVILLE (again, and again...)<br />There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants.<br /><br />A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE<br />Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!<br />Chicken Police is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir movies, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor.<br /><br />KEY FEATURES<br />- A thrilling, rich storyline with a classic film-noir twist<br />- Professional voiceover with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!<br />- A carefully crafted, \"\"colorful\"\" world<br />- A complex interrogation system<br />- More than 30 unique, fully voiced characters<br />- A cinematic film-noir-like experience with more than 20 cutscenes!<br />- Lots of clues, information, and collectibles to find<br />- A beautiful original soundtrack<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Everything from the visuals to the audio to the gameplay was designed and tweaked and polished to create the most intense and satisfying twin-stick shooter experience possible.<br /><br />SYSTEM initializing...<br />Multiple virus infections detected...<br />Launching DEVASTATOR program...<br /><br />You are the Devastator! Your objective is to eradicate 15 types of viruses in 3 unique modes: Quadrants, Sectors, and Cycles. In Quadrants, the wave layout is constantly changing as you battle increasingly intense waves of random viruses for 5 minutes. In Sectors, there are 55 unique waves of viruses across 5 sectors. And in Cycles, you'll battle semi-randomized spawning viruses across 5 variations of 11 waves. Complete your objective as the Devastator and take back control of the System!<br /><br />In addition to the main game modes, wave layouts, and various enemy virus types providing gameplay variety, Devastator's moment-to-moment gameplay contains surprising depth and subtlety. From the way you balance speed vs. firepower to the utilization of resources to knowing when to pick up powerups, Devastator rewards both fast reflexes and good strategy.<br /><br />Devastator features vector-inspired visuals mixed with HDR colors, five customizable full-screen filters and mesmerizing particle effects, all while running at insanely high framerates on high-resolution monitors. With modern graphics hardware, the game runs with ease on current high-end gaming monitors (such as 360hz at 1080p, 240hz at 1440p, or 120hz at 4k), and it can theoretically run faster at higher resolutions when better monitors and higher-throughput video cables exist in the future.<br /><br />Devastator was designed and developed by Luke Schneider (aka the Radiangames guy). Luke has been a huge twin-stick shooter fan since the 1980s, and has been developing twin-stick shooters since 2005. With Devastator, Luke decided it was time to make his ultimate and final 2D arcade-style twin-stick shooter.<br /><br />Devastator features include:<br /><br />* Ultra-high resolution and ultra-high framerates support - 4k 120hz, 1440p 240hz, 1080p 360hz, etc. <br />* 3 different game modes - Quadrants, Sectors and Cycles, each with their own unique pacing and feel<br />* 15 unique virus types to battle against <br />* 55 unique waves across 5 sectors<br />* Powerful power-up drops<br />* Ever-changing wave layouts<br />* Ultra-satisfying twin-stick shooting gameplay - that rewards you for your mastery and variety of tactics<br />* Beautiful HDR, particle-laden graphics - with 5 unique filters and tons of customization options<br />* Heart-pounding soundtrack and intense retro-styled sounds that enhance your experience",

        "description": "Dieselpunk Wars is a vehicle-building game set in an open, vast world. Not only will you construct a war machine of your dreams, but also take it for a spin on the deserts, in the mountains or the swamp. The game offers over 300 unique elements, many different materials and paintable armors that will enable you to build a remarkable machine. Different types of armor, cannons, motors, wheels and drives will allow you to construct driving, floating and flying machines. Build fighters, transporters, tanks, destroyers, airships, and many more. Enjoy the freedom of creation!<br />What's important is that each element affects the behavior and combat capabilities of your vehicles. Because of that, you will have to take into consideration things such as air drag. You can either upgrade your vehicle for a mission or build it again and start over. And be careful, exploiting your engines too much may to their destruction – you don't want them to catch fire, do you? Every destroyed element impacts the rest of your vehicle, its efficiency, and its endurance.<br />Take part in massive battles, unleash the full potential of your vehicle and launch an invasion to conquer entire Islands in a single-player campaign. Discover the weaknesses of your enemies' vessels and figure out their battle plans. You'll have many different weapons to choose from, including missile launchers, machine guns, flamethrowers, torpedo launchers, bombs, depth charges, and crazy close combat weapons. <br />Create the war machine of your dreams, make sure that it is made well enough to take a hit and start wiping out your enemies!",

Hatred and darkness filled the heart of that boy, and he became evil because all seagulls are evil!<br /><br />Though he's not our hero. Our hero today is a slice of butter named Doctor Oil. Dr. Oil is a bit evil as well, but not as evil as any seagull! This brave and tiny dairy product just hates the sounds of seagulls, and so he decides to kill Captain Seagull by his own hand. This desire becomes the possible future that will last for the 75 stages from 5 different worlds!

Find items, characters, minigames, and hidden jokes.<br />* Roughly the length of a comedy movie (~90 minutes); includes one ending to choose from.<br />* Sometimes emotionally impactful dialogue & cinematics, sometimes jokes about pants.<br /><br />== Story ==<br /><br />In a world teeming with magic and danger, a city of accountants exists which has sequestered itself behind high walls and generally unacceptable accounting principles. A battle accountant there, George, is assigned the unenviable task of leaving the safety of the city in order to storm a nearby castle, slay the dragon, rescue the princess, and (most importantly) rescue the unpaid tax revenue. Meanwhile, Ayraw (the dragon), is tired of knights showing up to slay her, and is a bit jealous no one ever wants to rescue her. So she concocts a plan to trick George into rescuing her instead of rescuing the princess. Hijinks ensue as the two team up, the unlikely duo slowly growing closer through their shared adventure.",

A battle accountant there, George, is assigned the unenviable task of leaving the safety of the city in order to storm a nearby castle, slay the dragon, rescue the princess, and (most importantly) rescue the unpaid tax revenue. Meanwhile, Ayraw (the dragon), is tired of knights showing up to slay her, and is a bit jealous no one ever wants to rescue her. So she concocts a plan to trick George into rescuing her instead of rescuing the princess. Hijinks ensue as the two team up, the unlikely duo slowly growing closer through their shared adventure.<br /><br />===== Hoard of Bonus Content =====<br /><br />Every dragon needs a hoard!

Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.<br /><br />•\tBold New Beginning — His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. <br />•\tA Second Chance — Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.<br />•\tA Darker, More Elemental World — From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore God of War's breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise.<br />•\tVicious, Physical Combat — With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.",

Made by The Chinese Room – the studio responsible for the hauntingly beautiful Dear Esther – this tale of how people respond in the face of grave adversity is a non-linear, open-world experience that pushes innovative interactive storytelling to the next level.<br /><br />Over the course of the game, the player slowly pieces together the fate of the valley from the fragmentary memories of the people who made it their home. By finding and interacting with the traces of these lost lives, the player gradually learns about the stories and relationships of the inhabitants – how they lived, and how they died. All this is accomplished through revolutionary environmental storytelling – what you see and hear in Rapture is just as important as what you do.",

The Mascherines have perpetuated a culture of inequality between the power-hungry guildsmen known as the Masquerada and the impoverished lower classes, the Contadani.<br /><br />One of Ombre's finest sleuths, Cicero Gavar, was exiled for a crime against the state five years ago, but he is now summoned back to Ombre to solve the mysterious kidnapping of the diplomat Razitof Azrus. As other members of the Masquerada join his investigation, all having their doubts about one another within this culture of deception, their faith will be pushed to the limit as a deeper conspiracy lurks in the shadows of Ombre.",

Say goodbye to the complicated command input. The intuitive command called \"Progressive\" will make you play the exact way you want. Players used to traditional style are able to play by using \"Classic\" command input (but we recommend Progressive Mode!). Needless to say, there is Online play. Equipped Ranking system and Leader Board. Training Mode is also substantial. Also, there is \"Casual Match\" where you can fight with your friend 1 on 1 via the network!<br /><br />The original characters from our EX series have powered up and come back for the first time in about 20 years!! You get to see the NEW \"Skullo Dream\"! Lovely Hokuto changed to Beauty Shirase! The original characters: Kairi, Shirase, Hokuto, Garuda, Skullomania, Darun Mister, Allen Snider, Doctrine Dark, Blair Dame, Jack, Shadowgeist, Sanane, Hayate...and maybe more!?<br /><br />The new system called \"GOUGI\" is the key to play this game! By meeting certain requirements, the GOUGI will activate, and your character will gain new powers that last until the end of the match. 5 GOUGI make up 1 Deck, and each Deck is different. For example, in the case of using \"Infinity\" Deck; after activating Super Combos 10 times, you will be able to use Super Combos anytime you want! 5 types of GOUGI Decks are included by default, and other 10 types of Decks can be purchased by additional contents. The way you play will be changed by the GOUGI even with the same character. Find one that suits your playstyle and win!!",

        "description": "This original adventure game explores a love story between two beautiful souls through ingenious humour and a bizarre, hand-drawn, frame-by-frame animation style. Our hero's beloved has been abducted by evil spirits, and the only way to reunite them is to reincarnate himself as a dragon to defeat Evil. But something has gone wrong, and his soul is reborn as a worm named Pip. Now Pip must overcome the challenges of a surreal world, solve mind bending puzzles, and save his love. Choosing between good and evil, Pip learns the laws of Karma, and his choices define the outcome of the game.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />— Play as Pip and explore a rich, bizarre world.<br />— Use Astral sight, a power that allows you to peek into the world of spirits at any point of the game.<br />— Learn Karma laws through choice and action. Each evil deed spoils Pip's karma and changes his appearance. Good deeds purify karma. Key characters respond differently to Pip's karma, opening additional storyline.<br />— Hand-drawn animations of the varied interactions of Pip with his strange environment. The environment and other characters of the quests are drawn individually for each situation.<br />— Live magical award winning music and sound by ZMEIRADUGA.",

It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky's the limit!<br /><br />Disclaimer<br />Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.<br /><br />Key Features<br /><br />• You can be a goat<br />• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat<br />• In-game physics that bug out all the time<br />• Seriously look at that goat's neck",

The invaders seek to use their advanced technology to annihilate humanity, but they weren't expecting the people of Earth to counter with sophisticated technology of our own. Enter Project ExZeus, humanity's last and best defense to repel the otherworldly menace and restore peace to our little blue planet using ultra high tech fighting robots! Take control of four different robots and blast those aliens back to where they came from in these action-focused high-flying 3D arcade style rail shooters!<br /><br />ExZeus<br /><br />In the year 2102 C.E. a massive, previously unknown asteroid entered Earth's orbit and began unleashing waves of attacks on the planet, killing thousands of people every day and devastating human civilization. The lucky few who survived the initial onslaught managed to escape deep underground, narrowly preventing humanity's extinction. The Governing Council ordered an immediate counter-attack using three experimental robots: Calista, Sophia, and Dynamis. With that, Operation ExZeus was born. Now, you must choose one of the three giant flying robots to take into battle against the invading forces of Diadora. Soar through the skies, blast away enemies, and reclaim Earth for its people!<br /><br />ExZeus 2<br /><br />After a century of peace, Operation ExZeus and the defeat of Diadora are but a distant memory for the people of Earth. However, the peace was not to last. A new menace has emerged from deep space in the form of five mysterious pods, each one a weapon of mass destruction, which have landed in densely populated areas around the globe. To combat these new threats, Operation ExZeus has been reopened with the legendary robots Calista, Sophia, and Dynamis being fused together to create the ultimate fighting robot, Minos. Dominate the land and skies as you take control of Minos to repel the alien threat, destroy the five pods, and defeat the invaders once and for all!<br /><br />• Give your trigger finger a workout and unleash your full arsenal of weaponry and super attacks against waves of invading alien forces.<br /><br />• Battle through urban cityscapes, dense forests, snow-covered mountains, desert wastelands, and even under the sea to eradicate the threat to mankind.<br /><br />• Take on giant bosses that will test your skills to their limit while you dodge a hail of attacks and take aim for their weak points.<br /><br />• Collect gold during your missions to spend on energy, shields, mega bombs, and more.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers.<br /><br />Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these \"flying soldiers\" can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these \"characters\", they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance.<br /><br />Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.<br /><br />It's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

I'm waiting for you Miyamoto Musashi!” <br />There is no doubt for Musashi that the voice was the Sasaki Kojirō's one. His body was defeated, but his spirit remains, and his intentions are still destructive. Miyamoto Musashi then understood that he would have to travel across Japan from north to south and go to the island of Ganryû-jima, where he firstly defeated Sasaki Kojirō, to fight again and liberate the spirit of Kojiro forever.<br /><br />Features:<br />- A hack'n'slash inspired by the story of Takezo Musashi “The Stone And The Sword” released in 1930's by Eiji Yoshikawa and which is one of the most famous story and real samurai in Japan!<br />- Explore a 17th century fantasist Japan through seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter.<br />- Defeat Kojiro in The Floating Fortress and save Japan! <br />- Dash, double-jump, wall-jump and throw kunais to defeat various enemies!<br />- Use your special abilities, kamis, to take advantage of your enemies.<br />- Collect Hanafuda cards through levels.<br />- A beautiful pixel-art game inspired by classics !",

And thus Glittering Sword is not that kind of game that some may think judging by screenshots or trailer. On the first glance it looks like typical action-adventure, like many other classic titles from the 90's. Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it's shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: «fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher. We hope that players who are addicted to adventure games will fall in love with this small but very entertaining game.",

For example, the knight is thrilling the land, stunning all the enemies on the line, while the huntress is charging a bow with energy, simultaneously firing arrows at all the enemies.",

After years of serving as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with her own life. But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they'd ever seen before.<br /><br />However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she's never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can't explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years.<br /><br />While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she's felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail's death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Discover the power of morality in each journey where choices and actions have meaningful consequences.<br /><br />Hindsight 20/20 is founded on five pillars:<br /><br />1. Choice in Combat: <br />Decide the fate of two kingdoms as one-armed warrior Jehan. Will he choose to respect the values of his former home by respecting life in all forms? Or will he choose the path of conflict and violence? Before every battle, make the conscious decision to wield a non-lethal stun rod to pacify enemies or a ruthless sword to put them down for good.<br /><br />2. A Malleable World: <br />Champaner and its inhabitants switch between several states of disdain or acceptance for Jehan. Each playthrough shows only one version of the world as both the town and its inhabitants experience the effects of Jehan's choices and actions.<br /><br />3. Interesting AI and Bosses: <br />All NPCs react to the world Jehan shapes. Dialogue options and weapon choice are only two factors in how the AI behaves. Hindsight 20/20's bosses exhibit emotion, making them more relatable. Nuances in their personality come to light as Jehan continues on his journey. The line between good and evil blurs as they react to Jehan.<br /><br />4. The Experience Engine: <br />The Experience Engine is a hand-crafted, in-house gameplay engine driven by player choice. This engine is solely responsible for creating the dynamic gameplay and story experiences Jehan witnesses. Every action and choice made is observed and recorded by the Experience Engine leading to a high level of replayability. This feedback loop of choices, actions, and reactions affect the flow of the story and drives the gameplay of Hindsight 20/20.<br /><br />5. Ten different endings:<br />Hindsight 20/20 has 10 different endings and four of those endings have absolutely no overlap. Each ending is carefully tailored to the choices and actions made in that journey. And unlocking each ending grants specific trophies as well.",

In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle. This way, heroes will be an extension of each player's style, creating an unique gameplay with hundreds of combinations.<br /><br />1-4 players",

        "description": "HIVE is a futuristic multiplayer hero shooter with a frenetic 2.5D side-scrolling gameplay. Up to 10 players can simultaneously fight in the Hexadiums, scenarios that are divided into 6 zones, each with its own gravity, different platforms, hideouts and open spaces, that turn them into a frenetic battlefield. In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle. This way, heroes will be an extension of each player's style, creating an unique gameplay with hundreds of combinations.<br /><br />HIVE: Altenum Wars full game + HIVE: Altenum Wars Space Theme + 14 Avatars",

        "description": "Fast & fluid arcade-style SHMUP meets hardcore roguelike! Take flight on a pimped-up jetboard and face off against massive, multi-stage bosses. A classic for the next generation!<br /><br />An intense, arcade-style, 'bullet hell' SHMUP/STG in which you must master a vast array of ridiculous weaponry in order to defeat a race of evil aliens who are intent on abducting innocent civilians and turning them into mutants. Jetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern roguelikes. Don't expect a story. Do expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced 60fps action, big guns, and explosions!<br /><br />The Jetboard: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock.<br /><br />The Enemies: Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game's weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too…<br /><br />The Weapons: From the conventional to the ridiculous! Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission! and leave a path of total destruction in your wake. Get up close and dish out massive damage with the shotgun, wreak havoc with the cluster bomb, fry enemies to a crisp with the flame tornado or shock them into submission with the lightning bolt. You'll get a different selection of weapons with each playthrough and you'll need to master them all!<br /><br />The Bosses: Defeat huge bosses in a series of grueling multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use. Rendered in exquisite pixel-art detail, these guys will test your weapon-handling and evasive maneuvering to their limits.<br /><br />The Planets: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons. Adapt your route based on your playstyle, the weapons you unlock and the treasure you discover. Plunder cash from fallen enemies and use it to pimp up your jetboard, jetsuit and max out your weapons for a formidable arsenal. Are you up to the challenge?",

His new adventure, Leisure Suit Larry - Wet Dreams Don't Dry, takes him – whatever the route or twist of fate – from the end of the '80s directly into the 21st century and wow, how the world has changed! While his view of the world and women from way back in the 1980s collides with modern reality harder than the breasts of a lusciously stacked blonde jogging along a beach, he's all set to date his way across the modern world!<br /><br />And if this wasn't enough, it's time to get wet again with his newest adventure, Leisure Suit Larry - Wet Dreams Dry Twice. Because, Larry's not done yet and he's still dreaming of you. He left New Lost Wages, stranded in Cancum, and had prepared to marry his only true love, Faith. But, unforeseen events interrupted them and they've become separated again! She is somewhere in the famous, sunny and huge Kalau'a archipelago and he has to find her. Help him — if he doesn't find her soon, he may burst!",

But as more victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, will the scales of justice tip in favor of defending the law or enacting vengeance?<br /><br />From the studio that brought you the Yakuza series, Lost Judgment weaves elements of investigative sleuthing, noir narrative and action combat into one mystery thriller. Take your detective expertise to the streets of Japan and defend those that the law fails to protect.<br /><br />INVESTIGATIVE ACTION  <br />Tap into Yagami's arsenal of private eye tricks to gather clues. From hi-tech gadgets including drones and social media listening devices to hardboiled gumshoe methods like scaling buildings and tracking suspects in the city. No stronger evidence than catching a suspect in the act.<br /><br />FREEFORM COMBAT  <br />Master Yagami's three unique, combo-heavy martial arts styles to overcome any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Further weaponize street fights with traffic cones, street signs, bicycles and beyond, plus customize each style with skill trees.<br /><br />DEEP UNDERCOVER<br />Go undercover at a local high school as a club advisor to get to the root of a mysterious rise in delinquency as it relates to the case. Join the Dance Club, where you'll be grooving to the rhythm; the Robotics Club, tasking your ingenuity to build the ultimate Yagami-bot; a boxing gym, to stick and move against fierce opponents; and a bike gang, where underground racing is the only way to earn respect.<br /><br />HIT THE STREETS  <br />As you comb the open cities of Kamurocho and Ijincho in pursuit of the case, take a break and get to know the unique culture of each through bars and other nightlife hotspots. It may be worth taking on a Side Case to lend your detective skills to residents in need – you never know who holds what cards.",

        "description": "December 2021, Tokyo district court. Akihiro Ehara stands accused of groping a woman on a crowded train. A bystander's video footage of his attempt to flee the scene and subsequent apprehension is all over the news, and public outcry demands a maximum sentence.<br /><br />“Three days ago, a dead body was found in an abandoned building in Yokohama. Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room.<br /><br />His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further.<br /><br />How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice?<br /><br />From just a single stumble, one can become a monster…<br /><br />LAW AND DISORDER - Lost Judgment once again puts players in the sneakers of lawyer turned street-fighting detective Takayuki Yagami. Joined by his partner, ex-yazuka Masaharu Kaito, the crime-fighting duo is called on to investigate a seemingly perfect crime whose lead suspect has an airtight alibi. What starts out as a tale of revenge reveals a tangled web of conspiracy involving several unlikely factions taking advantage of a broken law system. But as victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, he must choose between defending the law or exacting justice.<br /><br />FREEFORM COMBAT - Yagami's distinct martial arts forms grant him mastery of any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Harness Crane, Tiger, and the new Snake stance, a graceful style that can deflect and return an opponent's strikes, using their energy against them.<br /><br />INVESTIGATIVE ACTION - Yagami's arsenal of detective tricks grows with new gadgets, stealthily tracking suspects, and crafty methods of infiltration. Leave no stone unturned in pursuit of the truth.<br /><br />NO PLACE FINER – Immerse yourself in the bustling downtowns of Tokyo and Yokohama at your own pace within an authentic setting that only the RGG Studio can deliver. Game at Club SEGA, find your next favorite hangout, take on cases from locals need, and beyond.",

Travel through alien planets, forgotten caves, old castles, and its dark corridors, and collect powerful, toxic drinks that will grant you some special abilities and thus help you with your quest. <br />It's a solo campaign, but you'll never be alone - beware of the demons, they are everywhere and they want to see you dead. <br />You'll have the chance to visit many unique locations, fight powerful monsters, avoid traps and fight bosses! <br />Investigate the source of the radio signal in an old castle on Neo Valkyria, discover the secrets of a suspicious-looking laboratory, explore Alien World with its intriguing wildlife and try not to die in flames while on a mission in Lava Cave. <br />There are all sorts of beverages for you to acquire and every single one of them has its own unique power. Protect yourself, slow your enemies, become incredibly powerful and even visit other dimensions, but be careful... the drinks may be a little toxic! Some of them can make you feel a little fuzzy. <br />Do you often feel nostalgic? Check out the \"old-school\" mode, which will take you on a journey through the pixelated version of the game! Get a taste of the good, old days!<br />Spend hours tearing up any demon who stands in your way! Watch the blood spurt everywhere and leave the pile of corpses in your wake!",

A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened by the “research and charity” branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation, the asylum has been operating in strict secrecy… until now. Acting on a tip from an anonymous source, independent journalist Miles Upshur breaks into the facility, and what he discovers walks a terrifying line between science and religion, nature and something else entirely.<br /><br />Whistleblower:<br />Whistleblower will let you play as Waylon Park, a software engineer under contract with Murkoff and the man who emailed journalists around the world - including Miles - at the beginning of Outlast. <br />Although Whistleblower tells the story that led to Outlast, it will actually stretch past the events of the first game to show the final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story.",

These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />- Flow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black - upward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being carried by a flow.<br /><br />- Fascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions.<br /><br />- Design without words. There is almost no text in the game and the story is told through gameplay and visuals.<br /><br />- Meditative ambient soundtrack by Brokenkites.",

        "description": "Tucked away from the outside world by the impenetrable haze of the Misty Woods, the village of Adam has mostly lived in peace since the days of the Wraith War. The dark power that fueled that war has vanished, but darkness is descending once more and Adam's legendary hero, Orazio, is no more.<br /><br />10 years ago he left without explanation and never returned, leaving his son and adopted daughter to wrestle with the dark secret he left behind—a secret that must now be revealed if the children hope to save both Adam and their departed father, though its revelation could unhinge the world.<br /><br />Shadows of Adam is a creative, humorous and exciting take on the 16-bit JRPG era, but with its own twists and style for the modern day gamer. Fast-paced battles, gorgeous graphics, an awesome soundtrack and the convenience to save anywhere you like make it tough to resist! Whether playing on the TV or in handheld mode, the game's glorious pixels will immerse you in the adventure and its memorable scenes.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Compelling Character Driven Story: Shadows of Adam's story is one with a deep narrative and an interesting plot. The story revolves around 4 main characters: Asrael, Kellan, Curtis and Talon.<br />• A Strategic AP Management Battle System: AP is restored between each round of battle automatically and through defeating enemies. This allows a unique attrition system that encourages skill use and fast combat.<br />• Beautiful Visuals: Shadows of Adam features beautifully modernized visuals inspired by classic JRPGs of the '90s.<br />• Original Soundtrack With Over 44 Tracks: An original soundtrack by Tyler Mire that's inspired by music from the genre's greatest games. This soundtrack includes unique themes for each area and character and has an emphasis on strong melodies and an emotional connection.",

        "description": "Before he was the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock's quest for truth.<br /><br />As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.<br /><br />Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It's time to confront your past so you can become the legend you're destined to be.<br /><br />KEY PILLARS<br /><br />The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you'll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We've never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you're living it.<br /><br />Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace.<br /><br />And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there's something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean.<br /><br />A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really?<br /><br />A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult.<br /><br />Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It's up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you'll become.",

        "description": "Do you like stories? If so, then I'll tell you one. But it won't be just any old story. It's going to be different, because it's about real people, about events that are touching and horrifying even now. Let's go back in time. It all began with a meeting between a boy and a girl who came from two different worlds. For a short time they had good laughs together, taking joy simply from each other's company. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. War broke out – the Evil King plundered the city and his robot-soldiers appeared everywhere. Citizens were separated and some of them were marked and forced to move out of their homes and live in a place that was sealed off from the rest of the city by a huge wall. Fortunately the children were not alone – they had each other. Their friendship allowed them to stay together, even though fate seemed to try to tear them apart. That's the story behind My Memory of Us, a game dedicated to those that were separated, but managed to find the strength to meet each other again.<br /><br />What makes My Memory of Us stand out is that the story is told from the perspective of two friends who complete each other. Each of them has their own abilities – she can run fast, he can sneak – but only when they work together as a team can they overcome all adversities. You just want to have fun with your friend. Go on then! Grab her hand and find out what adventures are waiting for you outside. Together, there's nothing in the world that can stop you.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />A moving story about friendship and love in dangerous times<br /><br />Beautiful, sketch-like graphics inspired by naïve art<br /><br />Pair mechanics: take control of two characters with different skills and abilities, or control them as a pair<br /><br />A grotesque tale mixed with bittersweet humor<br /><br />The events shown in the game are based on actual stories from war<br /><br />A dialogue system built around the language of symbolic pictures<br /><br />Various logical puzzles in 2.5D<br /><br />A story that offers deeper meaning, set in historical realities",

        "description": "A 3rd person, fixed-camera survival horror adventure. Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages.<br /><br />The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him – but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible.<br /><br />Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.<br /><br />As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them – and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain.<br /><br />A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's atmosphere.",

        "description": "The story of Raji: An Ancient Epic begins with the start of a new war between the demons and the gods. Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction.<br />Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons.<br />Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race.<br /><br />Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war.<br />Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.<br /><br />Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene!<br />Every corner of the game's environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games.<br /><br />Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next.<br /><br />For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored.<br />From enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Like any other perfectly normal school, its students and faculty are going missing and the classrooms have been locked down for weeks. Yes, there's nothing remarkable happening at WFHS whatsoever - just ask the new principal.<br /><br />Things are bound to get stirred up when an enthusiastic, bizarrely dressed new kid wanders into town. This go-getter's name is Daryl, and he just wants to make friends. What starts out as an innocent effort to help jump-start a young contraband textbook business turns into a harrowing quest through the school and its enormous, monster-filled classrooms in the hope of becoming the most popular kid in town. Oh - and saving everyone's lives is top priority, of course.<br /><br />No need to worry. There's nothing to see here at Water Falls High School.",

Traction, angle, braking, torque, trajectory, speed… every factor must be considered before heading to the workshop to change certain components and configuring the optimal set-up.<br /><br />A DREAM GARAGE<br />Your adventure starts by choosing your dream bike. In RiMS Racing, you can ride the world's 8 most powerful European and Japanese motorcycles: Ducati Panigale V4 R, MV Agusta F4 RC, Aprilia RSV4, BMW M 1000 RR, Suzuki GSX-R1000R, Honda CBR1000RR, Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10RR, Yamaha YZF-R1. Recreated with an unmatched level of detail thanks to close collaboration with each manufacturer, these bikes also provide a highly accurate and realistic riding experience. They are true rough diamonds that only need a few cuts to shine their brightest!<br /><br />OPTIMISE YOUR BIKE<br />With a mechanics management system never before seen in a motorcycle simulation, you can dismantle all your bike's parts to maintain them after each race or to upgrade them and boost your performance. You will become familiar with every last screw in your bike. Browse a catalogue of over 500 official spare parts from the biggest names in the industry along with over 200 official equipment items to personalise your rider!<br /><br />ANALYSE YOUR PERFORMANCE<br />RiMS Racing thrusts you straight into the heart of the action with the Motorbike Status Check (MSC), which helps you analyse your bike's behaviour in real time and understand how to optimise your performance. Brake disc temperature, tyre pressure and wear, suspension behaviour affecting stability, electronic settings… Just like for a real rider, your bike's configuration can be adapted to your riding style!<br /><br />ACCURATE AND REALISTIC PHYSICS<br />The level of accuracy and details provided by the mechanics management and MSC is matched by realistic motorcycle physics that will thrill the most demanding of track racers. But thanks to the various ride assist technologies, less experienced players can still learn the techniques that will take them to the top.<br /><br />THE MOST ICONIC CIRCUITS<br />Silverstone, Laguna Seca, Suzuka, Nürburgring, Paul Ricard… Travel the world and enjoy thrilling races on 10 faithfully recreated official circuits. For those who prefer roads, five routes in the stunning landscapes of the United States, Norway, Australia, Spain and Italy have been recreated for a different racing experience on two wheels!<br /><br />MANAGE YOUR CAREER AND TEAM<br />Career mode in RiMS Racing gives you control of a team.

The main difficulty is to understand what you have to do in order to get asylum. You've come from an foreign land in the south and find yourself lost and confused - a confusion you convey through letters to your sister back home. An important part of the gameplay, these letters help you understand your tasks while at the same time moving the narrative of the game forward.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Don't rely on brute force solely! Sometimes you need to outsmart your enemy, not just outgun them with bullets.<br /><br />In the end of 2020 the worst thing in history of mankind has happened — gates of Hell has opened and let the hellish hordes of demons run wildly on Earth. For the hellspawns the human weapons was not much of a threat, just like peashooter versus elephant. It looked like the human race has no hope left for survival. But in the darkest hour the glimpse of hope, the ray of light appeared, and so it happened: the group of american scientists with Dr. Gusev as their lead scientist invented the special photon cannons, that can easily tear demon flesh apart. New photon weapons were installed on advanced tank models, created by Greenrunner Industries corporation. But there was a problem with tanks — they can be operated only by those who created it. These people were genius engineers of their time, but when they opposed the government they were imprisoned as war criminals. But facing the total destruction of all life on Earth the government decided to make a compromise. Now there is only one way for Travis Greenrunner and his people to get their freedom back — to drive away the demon scum to the place they crawled out from!",

There's more to discover in the world besides murderous hordes of the undead – find the journals scattered about to learn more about the outbreak and ultimately where to find refuge! Don't think death can save you – every time you die, you'll awake trapped in this nexus.<br /><br />Outbreak: Endless Nightmares focuses on extreme replayability by offering multiple character options – each with their own abilities, upgrade paths and more! Each time you venture into the anomaly, it'll change and become increasingly difficult as you grow in power. You'll need to think carefully about what weapons, healing items, and other supplies you'll bring along. If you're lucky, you may find storage caches that give you access to your expanded inventory, and offer an opportunity to restock. But it's all on you to search your environment for supplies. If you run out ... your fate is sealed!<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled",

To restore balance to multiple dimensions, our videogame hero Dot recruits the help of the best gamer from 1995, an unassuming 9-year-old boy named David. Join this unlikely duo through challenging throwbacks to all your favorite classics from the late 16-bit and early 32-bit era of games inside a virtual reality world.<br /><br />The game evokes a genuine nostalgic feeling, such as the adrenaline of playing games without getting caught after your mom told you to go to bed, or the thrill of finding that brand new game at the store. You have to do all that and more through multiple environments - including your living room, bedroom, the local video rental store, the arcade at the pier, and more. With 6 fully original and highly differentiated levels, where each one feels like an entire new game, Pixel Ripped 1995 is an incredible journey for both VR and retro gamers.",

Dialogue options let you choose how Princess Farmer interacts with her friends, affecting your relationships with them. Make them your BFF and they may reward you with gifts!<br /><br />Princess Farmer was just an ordinary farmer when one day she woke up under the Gaia Tree. Now through the magic of Mother Gaia, she can hoist up whole rows of veggies with ease to make matches and smash obstacles by herself, in co-op, or even with an AI companion!

I'm sure that every one of you saved the world from them for so many times he can't even count and brought peace to one or another planet. All these pesky alien invaders love to attack and capture anything they can reach their hands to. This was earlier, this happens now and believe me it'll happen again in the future.<br /><br />In Rusty Gun the aliens are confronted not by some over-muscled macho, fan of bubblegum, not some secret organzation dressed in black, and not even chickenpox. This time the defender of Earth and his own private peace appears to be some casual grouchy old Earthling, who was hurt by aliens that spoiled his favorite fishing leisure by scaring all the fish away. Without any hesitation old man picked up his old and rusty rifle with only one goal — to show the alien invaders that there idea of having Earth destroyed while he has fishing full on his hands — the worst possible idea.<br /><br />Explore the locations infested by alien dirtbags, keep finding secrets and new types of bullets for your rifle. Remember that the whole destiny of mankind is in your hands, and don't forget that you're just old, grumpy and love to kill.",

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity's last line of defense.<br /><br />Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF.

As Luna, travel to 5 exotic planets to track down your mutinous mates, and face them in Bullet Hell dogfights to the death!<br /><br />- Stop! Bullet Time<br />Outnumbered and outgunned, it's a good thing Luna has an ace up her sleeve: a space fighter craft that can alter the flow of time itself! Power up the Bullet Time gauge by destroying enemies or catching their attacks in a bomb blast, then enter Bullet Time! Enemies and their projectiles will move in slow motion, while you can still fly and shoot at normal speed.<br /><br />- Galactic Gold Rush<br />Why eat lead when you could turn lead into gold? During Bullet Time, the bullets from any enemies you destroy will be converted into gold cubes to collect! Will you play it safe and quickly cash in bullets for survival, or take a risk and allow bad guys to flood the screen with fire for a massive score boost?<br /><br />- Eye of the Tiger<br />Star Hunter DX is old school hard, but wants you to succeed: the extensive practice mode will help beginners to survive, and allow pros to perfect their runs. Push it to the limit and rise to the top of the leaderboards!<br /><br />- Super Streaming<br />Why stop at the top of the leaderboards, when you could show off your skills (or practice runs) live? Star Hunter DX plays nicely with popular streaming software so that you can broadcast on your favourite site easily.",

The worse the terrors of war became, the more the artist obsessively painted beautiful landscapes as a contrast to the evil he had witnessed. One night, a mysterious figure appeared in the house seemingly out of nowhere. The stranger walked slowly around the room, inspecting the paintings. He then sat down in front of the artist; to offer him a deal.<br />The chance to enter one of his own creations, far away and free of war. But he would have to find his way back out before midnight, or else his soul would become trapped in the canvas forever. Feeling alone, on the edge of madness, terrorized by the scent of death creeping in from the streets, the artist shook the mysterious man's hand, accepting the deal.<br />A few moments later, the house was empty.<br /><br />KEY FEATURES<br />- Unique artstyle and a surreal environment to explore<br />- A collection of clever puzzles that will challenge your creativity<br />- An ever-changing world that develops as you progress<br />- Hidden secrets to find<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled",

Getting both games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT's tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem. Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world. You can be truly free.<br /><br />SUPERHOT<br /><br />Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.<br /><br />SUPERHOT's features:<br /><br />Endless Mode : how long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies?<br /><br />Challenge Mode: take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more.<br /><br />Replay Editor: edit and upload your best runs for all to see on killterest.com.<br /><br />Extras: delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted].<br /><br />Thirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and design. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and nominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by its independent, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the globe.<br /><br />SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE<br /><br />Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT's signature power fantasy.<br /><br />You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow-motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they're stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched.<br /><br />Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel.<br /><br />You take a moment to consider. You've been here before. So many times. <br />Maybe this time it will actually mean something.<br /><br />MCD's features<br /><br />The third game in the SUPERHOT franchise - MIND CONTROL DELETE gives you more insight into the world of SUPERHOT, more story, more signature gameplay. Keep dancing the slow motion ballet of destruction for so much longer than ever before.<br /><br />Much bigger than its predecessors. MCD immerses you in its world for days of increasingly explosive slow motion combat.<br /><br />More mechanics at your disposal than ever before. Experiment with different play styles, different character builds, different ways to outsmart and dominate your enemies.<br /><br />More power to accumulate as you progress through the game. Amass skills, hacks, special techniques to conquer waves of ever more dangerous enemies.<br /><br />More characters for you to control and for your enemies to throw at you. Test your arsenal of tricks and weapons against increasingly deadlier, smarter foes.<br /><br />More polish applied over nearly four years of Early Access development. MCD offers a more refined, sharper, flashier experience than any SUPERHOT so far.<br /><br />More meaning?",

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers.<br /><br />History: <br />In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk.  In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood.<br /><br />Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.<br /><br />Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!<br /><br />TD features: <br />- Shop system for buying and improving towers and for purchasing special weapons <br />- 9 defense towers, capable of improvement (2 improvements each within a battle)<br />- Support towers, special attacks and elements that can be placed along the path <br />- Unique opponents - 54 unlockable maps  + 9 bonus maps <br />- Tower control (control of direction and aim of a tower) <br />- Power-up for each tower: damage, rate of fire, range <br />- can be placed along the path: mine, adhesive cream fence, block wall <br />- Supporters: fire power expansion, range expansion <br />- Global help: area bomb, atomic bomb, air support",

        "description": "Immerse yourself in a dramatic yet charming and witty world of evidence-gathering, deduction and courtroom battles with this double-pack of the adventures of rookie lawyer Ryunosuke.<br /><br />Set in late 19th century Japan and England, each title features five murder-mystery episodes filled with all the drama, laughs, twists, and “turnabouts” you've come to expect from the legally labyrinthine legacy of Ace Attorney. Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you!<br /><br />In the course of each case, you'll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimonies, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn't be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn't shout “OBJECTION!” when you know you've got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution's claims and prove your client's innocence.<br /><br />The game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease! Will you be able to crack these clever cases? The game is afoot!<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

As Redgi, heir to the Rat Throne, you must restore your broken Kingdom by banishing the merciless Frog Clan and their ferocious leader, Greenwart. As you explore the deceivingly charming world, you'll encounter a cast of unique companions, ready to aid you in your adventure. And you'll need all the help you can get, whether that's new meal recipes, blueprints to forge deadly weapons and armour, or even a land-chugging, armour-plated mole mobile! Overcome your fears. Rescue your brothers. Restore Your Kingdom. Your tail has begun…<br /><br />Master Brutal Combat<br />From frog zombies to gargantuan grubs - and everything in-between - the Kingdom is awash with danger. To overcome each perilous encounter, you'll need to study your opponent's attacks and react accordingly! Thankfully, there's a range of deadly abilities at your disposal, including parry bashes and fatal executions, not to mention ranged attacks with your nifty bow and arrow.<br /><br />Explore a Treacherous Kingdom<br />Fully accompanied by the deep, raspy narrations of Doug Cockle, prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the mediaeval-fantasy Rat Kingdom. Complete side quests and faction hunts for some additional gold-on-the-side, or join forces with a sharp-eyed companion to help even the playing field.<br /><br />Customise your Attack<br />Adapt Redgi's combat style to the task at hand. Heavy armour may provide better protection but can you really afford to slow down your dodge-roll? And then there's the question of weapon; axes pack a punch, while spears are quick and nimble. Perhaps you'd prefer the all-round performance of a trusty broadsword?<br /><br />Overcome Savage Boss Fights<br />While danger lurks around every toadstool, you'll need to keep your wits sharp and your blade sharper when it comes to the devastating boss fights. Cold-blooded in every sense of the word, these oversized amphibians each present their own unique combat challenge, and you'll need more than a good set of armour to come out on top.<br /><br />Brew Recipes, Craft Weapons, Forge Armour<br />Redgi's keep is also home to his brothers, Rem-Rem, Bam-Bam and Dug. Rem can cook up a health-boosting feast with ingredients found throughout the world, while Bam can craft new weapons and armors from special blueprints you'll uncover… if you look hard enough. And then there's Dug, who'll update you about new quests available throughout the Kingdom.<br /><br />Features:<br />- Master brutal combat, inspired by the souls-like genre, featuring dodge-rolls, parry bashes, and fatal executions!<br />- Explore a vast and treacherous Kingdom, comprising six distinct biomes, each with its own hidden paths and secrets.<br />- Immerse yourself in the compelling story, narrated by the deep, raspy Doug Cockle. <br />- Customise your attack style with a vast array of distinct weapons and armour.<br />- Assemble a band of brave companions, ready to aid you on select missions.<br />- Complete side quests to earn additional gold-on-the-side.<br />- Unearth special blueprints to forge new and powerful weapons.<br />- Collect rare ingredients to cook up health-boosting feasts.<br />- Overcome savage boss fights against the Frog Clan's deadly, oversized generals.<br />- Lose yourself in the gorgeous and lovingly-crafted 2D hand-drawn art style.<br /><br />This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.",

        "description": "The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante is a narrative-driven RPG that comes to life on the pages of the protagonist's journal. Set in a ruthless world where any form of dissent is mercilessly crushed, the story follows a man who has dared to challenge the existing order. Set out on a lifelong journey and become an individual able to carve out their own destiny... But remember that freedom never comes cheap.<br /><br />Life in the Great Arknian Empire is harsh and its hardest Lot is yours by the circumstance of birth. You are a commoner, holding no rights and no title. To seize your fate and become the rightful heir to the legacy of the Brante family you will have to come to grips with ossified tradition and prejudice. Embarking on a life-long journey from one's birth until true death, you will have to endure great upheavals, face adversity, and make many difficult choices. Every decision will affect not only the protagonist, his family, and loved ones, but may even topple the foundation of the Empire itself.<br /><br />Key features<br /><br />At the turn of time<br />Every imperial citizen's life is predetermined by their estate. The deities known as the Twin Gods have bestowed this truth to the world, dividing mortals into Lots. The nobles lead and rule over others, while the clergy guides people on the one true path, and the lowborn suffer, toiling away for the glory of the Empire. You may accept your fate without question, but it is also in your power to change the cosmic order that governs all.<br /><br />Your choice is not an illusion<br />Divided into chapters, the game keeps track of the player's deeds, the skills they acquired, as well as other overlapping circumstances that shape a unique plotline for each playthrough. Every decision has its consequences and you will be held accountable throughout the entire journey. To protect your family and loved ones, to impose the rule of the Emperor and make a fortune, or to try and change the world as you see fit... Make your choice, but beware of the follies of pride and ambition.<br /><br />Fight for your life<br />One man is anything but omnipotent in this realm yet under your guidance, Sir Brante may become a person who can endure every trial fate throws at him and rewrite the very laws that govern his world! Develop and train your character, leveling up such traits as determination, sensitivity, and endurance. All of the hero's skills, starting with those acquired in infancy, will affect his personality, worldview, and relationships, ultimately unlocking new talents and possible storylines.<br /><br />Find your own path<br />The first complete walkthrough can take you upwards of 15 hours! Numerous branching paths that affect the unfolding story will make every playthrough a unique experience: become a noble judge, learn the ways of the inquisition, plot a revolution as a member of a secret society, or embrace an entirely different purpose. Be brave and fate itself shall bend to your will!<br /><br />There and hereafter<br />Resurrection system allows the character to keep his experience upon death, letting the player reevaluate past steps and make adjustments to their strategy going forward. Take control not only of your life but also your demise, then put everything at stake in this cycle of death and rebirth!",

Grow your repair service business and start your own tank museum.<br /><br />Start the engine of a newly renovated tank, and feel its former power!<br />Use different tools to work on tanks:<br />- Rust Removal Tool<br />- Sand Blaster<br />- Paint Gun<br />- Hammer<br />- Grinder - to cut and grind<br />- Wrench pistol - to quickly disassemble rusted screws/bolts<br /><br />Experience the full process of renovation:<br />- Clean the tank from mud<br />- De-rust the tank<br />- Sandblast the tank<br />- Apply primer paint to the tank<br />- Apply final paint to the tank (factory paint)<br />- Add custom paint, camouflage, color, decal in the paint room<br />- Sell the tank or put it in your museum to gain money and reputation<br /><br />Take a tank apart<br />Use tools and take each tank apart. You can disassemble tank exterior parts, from the bottom (wheels and tracks) up to the turret (gun, barrel, gun cradle etc.). Additionally, the interior of the tank is also available to be renovated, the crew space, tank engine and tank drive system.<br /><br />Take a seat inside the tank, as any of its crew. From here you can have better and easier access to the interior parts of the tank. Repair hatches, viewers, ammo holders, drive control components and gearbox parts.<br /><br />To start the tank, you need to repair its engine, gearbox and fuel system. Take the engine out and move it to a special engine stand, to be able to interact with it. Make sure the fuel, coolant and oil systems are assembled and the fluids are filled, so the tank engine can be put to test.<br /><br />High focus on details<br />Our tanks and vehicles are based on construction documents, expert opinions and insights from top II World War museums. Our goal is to give a fun and realistic simulation experience of building and repairing these legendary machines.<br /><br />Customize the tank as you wish, use different camouflages, paint colors, decals etc.<br />Find and extract tanks<br />One of the ways to obtain a tank is to get it during the extraction mission. After finding the spot where the tank is underground, call for the excavation team. Prepare the tank for extraction, by pumping the mud out of the tank and then cleaning the tank from whatever's left. Finally, order the lifting of the tank onto the truck trailer, to finish the mission, and move the tank into the workshop.<br /><br />Test your renovated tanks<br />Go on the training ground, check how your tank is dealing with special obstacles. Get inside the tank, start the engine and drive around to see if everything is working correctly.<br /><br />You can also take the tank to the proving grounds, where you are able to shoot the tank's armament on a special shooting range. You can use two different camera modes for better control of the tank.",

Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies.<br /><br />On board derelict spaceships you'll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage...<br /><br />Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship's defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard.<br /><br />Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak.<br /><br />Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive.<br /><br />Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don't worry though, as any crafting progress you've made is retained from one to another.",

Enter your clan into the league and fight together to make your mark on the leaderboards. Nobody wants an empty trophy cabinet!<br /><br />Story Mode' adds a ton of variety by introducing physics based contraptions for the first time ever. A plethora of interesting machinery spices up the gameplay, and makes solo Worms much more fun! The single‐player game isn't only about dealing death and destruction, it's also about negotiating tricky swinging rope bridges and rescuing friendlies from death defying traps! The player spends much more time playing, and much less time waiting for their A.I. opponent to take a shot.<br /><br />PS4 game can be controlled via PS Vita",

The answer is: all of these elements formed Tetsumo Party!<br /><br />Tetsumo Party is a game where sumo warriors gather to join an unconventional contest, inspired by Japanese TV shows. They need to fit into the funny-shaped holes in an approaching bamboo wall, otherwise… well, let's say that it will result in rather ridiculous manner.<br /><br />But what's better than winning alone? Fighting your friends, of course! In Tetsumo Party you can gather up to 4 people in a hilarious face-off confrontation.<br />What is the challenge? You need to control every limb separately. And remember - incoming bamboo walls aren't that forgiving.<br /><br />- Little distractions will happen, such as a waiter bringing you food and refreshments. You can stretch out your hand for them, but watch out for the incoming wall!<br />- The game features single player as well as cooperative and versus local multiplayer modes.<br />- New characters to unlock!<br /><br />PS4 game can be controlled via PS Vita",

Enemies will dynamically take cover, charge or attack independently.<br /><br />The player is encouraged to continually move from cover to cover whilst laying down as much fire as possible, giving the game a real Wild West shoot-out atmosphere. Each path leads to an open arena where the player must face a final boss which will present different challenges depending on the chosen level and must be defeated in stages.<br /><br />PlayStationVR Required<br /><br />2 PSMove controllers required<br /><br />The Copper Canyon Shoot Out, the Copper Canyon franchise, and representative logos are owned by, and copyright of, Black Dragon Studios Ltd.

Immerse yourself in the visual artwork of internationally acclaimed media artist Bill Viola and the interactive designs of the award winning team at the USC Game Innovation Lab. Discover the secrets of this seminal experimental art game, re-mastered with new Bill Viola footage for PlayStation4.<br /><br />The Night Journey (2007-2018) was one of the earliest experimental art games conceived. It uses both game and video techniques to tell the universal story of an individual's journey towards enlightenment. The game design explores a challenging question: what is the game mechanic of enlightenment? How can we model such an intensely personal yet archetypal experience?<br /><br />The game has been exhibited in galleries worldwide and was awarded IndieCade's “Most Sublime Experience” award. The project stands as a milestone in the search to expand the boundaries of what game experiences may communicate through their game mechanics and world design.",

        "description": "Twin Breaker: A Sacred Symbols Adventure is a story-driven brick breaking game molded in the style of ‘80s arcade classics like Arkanoid and Breakout, but with a plot, characters, and meaning! In the early 2300s, Earth is still recovering from a decades-long World War that engulfed most of the planet, except for an isolationist United States that used its power and prestige not to fight, but to reach for the stars. But when NASA's generation ships disappear in interstellar space, only two pilots are capable of figuring out why. Featuring 40 stages, four boss fights, New Game+, multiple extra features, plenty of story and dialogue, collectibles, a rocking soundtrack, and a fun Platinum Trophy, Twin Breaker is an ode to both the past and the future. The game is developed by Lillymo (Perils of Baking, Habroxia) and written by long-time PlayStation media personality and podcast host Colin Moriarty.<br /><br />1-2 players<br />86MB minimum save size",

Most people live in megacities that rely on the labor of poor masses to sustain a modern standard of living for the few at the top. With the Earth scorched, water is liquid gold, and control of it is the truest form of power. Forced to cope with a permanent water shortage, ordinary people persist and toil in the hope that if they work hard enough, they too can someday swim every morning in the refreshing pools of the Gardens.<br /><br />We follow the story of Josephine Lace, a young hydraulic engineer eager to climb the corporate ladder and claim a spot at the top. Until the day when that promising future is ripped away from her, leaving her half-dead and homeless, she becomes hellbent on taking down the system that ruined her and left her without a heart. Along the way she meets a diverse group of people sympathetic to her cause, every one with secrets of their own. With their help, perhaps she will find redemption, love, and most of all - vengeance.<br /><br />VENGEFUL HEART FEATURES:<br />-Story rich in social commentary with both grim and humoristic undertones<br />-Synthwave soundtrack that makes you nostalgic for the time that never was<br />-Gorgeous art reminiscent of PC-98 with a personal touch<br />-Story branches with wildly different outcomes<br /><br />This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.",

At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay varies.<br /><br />It's a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you.<br /><br />Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life.<br /><br />Playable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede. The gameplay varies considerably between seasons, vignettes, and moments.<br /><br />Where the Bees Make Honey is the property of Wakefield Interactive LLC, used with permission.",

This game serves as a prequel to Whiskey Mafia: Frank's Story and tells a story of Leo's criminal group who takes part in different illegal activities. A humble guy named Christopher, the son of a port worker, finds himself as the newest mafia member. Can he make his American dream come true?<br /><br />This is not just another mafia game — it's a huge story inspired by the popular cult movies and mafia dramas. You'll get the feeling of what it is to be a gangster in the 1920s who was to do different criminal stuff: from carjacking to bootlegging. There's also some nostalgic feeling of the 20's to be found within the game — great mafia setting guaranteed!",

Across your journey you'll find a few more difficult ones as well, but every single puzzle in Will You Snail is completely optional and can be skipped if you want to.<br /><br />UNCOVER THE TRUTH! Find secrets, collect clues and try to piece together where you are and what happened. Will You Snail tells a rather crazy story about artificial intelligence, simulation theory and the future of humanity - and it's up to you to discover it.<br /><br />Explore, jump, die, repeat - and master all of the action-packed levels in this challenging platformer. Puzzles, secret hunting, a non-linear story about mysteries of the Universe, silly voice-acting and beautifully designed levels - all of this packed into this short but condesed, fourth wall breaking game!

Forced to play children's games in a world of never-ending dusk, Ai is hunted by otherworldly entities as her life hangs in the balance. When these horrors begin to bleed into the real world, Ai must accept that she has only three choices: hide, run, or die.<br /><br />◆Evolving gameplay<br />Test your courage in a dangerous game of hide and seek before initiating a terrifyingly twisted version of tag with abominations not of this world. Use the items you've gathered to flee your sunset hell, but be sure to remember the paths you've taken or risk being trapped there forever.<br /><br />◆Japanese locations ablaze with a haunting, beautiful sunset<br />Experience an unnerving mix of beauty, fear and nostalgia in a mysterious world where a Japanese house, school and hospital are all inexplicably connected. Explore corridors dyed twilight crimson, witness the ethereal glow of -amber through paper walls of a traditional Japanese house and escape creeping black shadows in hospital rooms where the power is somehow always out.<br /><br />◆Hide or die<br />10-year-old Ai has no defensive measures to defeat the enemies you face; instead, you must take advantage of each spirit's weaknesses to survive. Hold your breath to sneak past blind foes or dash past deaf ones as quick as your little legs can carry you. And if you can't get away in time, prepare to suffer a dire fate at the hands of unimaginable forces.<br /><br />◆A tragic tale of friendship, betrayal and facing your demons<br />Mute and anxious, Ai is grateful when she makes a group of friends to play with. But it turns out that the ghostly apparitions trapped in the world of dusk aren't the only things she has to contend with; ghosts can be cruel, but children even more so. Your classmates harbour dark thoughts and harrowing secrets that you must uncover to progress. Throughout the game, Ai will learn more about her new friends than perhaps she'd care to know...<br /><br />◆If only there were another way…<br />Upon clearing the game, another ending will become available to you. What story will this new path unveil? Slipping back into the terrifying world of Yuoni will see you face considerably more challenging foes for an even greater reward.",
