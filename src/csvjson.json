In Radio Commander situation reports are given to you in form of dramatic radio statements sent by troops fighting on the ground. And your only accessory is a strategic map, on which you can place tokens and notes. Radio Commander offers an unique experience very different from classic real time strategy games. It\u2019s a bold try to redefine the genre, as the player will be involved in a decision making process much more realistic than those pictured by casual RTS titles. Ask for situation reports. Listen what your men have to tell you. Send evac choppers and nape drops. Defeat the invisible enemy. Decide the fate of your soldiers. The choices you face will have a direct impact on the course of the game. They will also define views of your hero. Or maybe those are your views? Playing Radio Commander you must be prepared to answer tough questions about the righteousness of your actions, the price of a human life, and the toxic power of propaganda and stereotypes. Radio Commander includes: - 9 main campaign missions (every mission is possible to complete in several different ways), - 9 animated briefings, - 15 unit types, including: infantry, evac choppers, gunships, field artillery, aerial reconnaissance, M113 armored personnel carriers, and napalm-carrying F4 Phantom jets (every unit is described by a unique set of statistics and communicates with commander using a different voice), - full voice over, - over 200 dialogue\u2026","ESRBRating":"Mature","Publisher":"Console Labs","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-11","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/radio-commander-switch/hero","Slug":"radio-commander-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/radio-commander-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"65%","Price":"14.99","genre":"Simulation,Puzzle,Action,Strategy","SalePrice":"5.24","MexPrice":"116.20"},{"SCORE":"65","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/1790/skyhill-switch","SaleEnds":"2021-12-01","Title":"SKYHILL","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2021-11-10","description":"World War III was an unexpected and cruel tragedy\u2026 You seemed to have a nice time, hidden in your fancy penthouse in Skyhill Hotel...

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/r/rogue-bit-switch/hero","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"60%","Price":"4.99","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","SalePrice":"1.99","MexPrice":"39.99"},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2021-12-03","Title":"Rock 'N Racing Bundle Off Road & Grand Prix","LowestPrice":"3.99","SaleStarted":"2021-11-14","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

It's like a human's essence that can\u2019t be measured by a staged photo. And thus Glittering Sword is not that kind of game that some may think judging by screenshots or trailer. On the first glance it looks like typical action-adventure, like many other classic titles from the 90's. Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it\u2019s shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: «fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher. We hope that players who are addicted to adventure games will fall in love with this small but very entertaining game.","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"ChiliDog Interactive","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-05","Image":"https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_pad,f_auto,q_auto,w_300/ncom/en_US/games/switch/g/glittering-sword-switch/hero","Slug":"glittering-sword-switch","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/glittering-sword-switch/","platform":"Switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PercentOff":"45%","Price":"4.99","genre":"Puzzle,Action","SalePrice":"2.74","MexPrice":"60.92"},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2021-11-28","Title":"Hammer 2 Reloaded","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2021-11-07","description":"Enjoy intense action in this third-person shooter action game.
