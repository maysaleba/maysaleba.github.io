All inventor and free spirit Rufus wanted to do was to get off the junkyard planet of Deponia and move to Elysium, the paradise orbiting Deponia as a spaceship reserved for the highest echelons of society. Goal, the ex-Elysian girl that Rufus has fallen head over heels for, still seems to be the key to his endeavor...and to the elevator that will get him to space. Finally, Rufus has come up with a seemingly perfect plan. And yet, everything that could possibly go wrong suddenly does go wrong. Rufus finds himself (initially in disguise) on a highway cruiser amongst stern-faced officials of the Organon, while Goal goes missing. When Rufus stumbles upon a cloning machine, he believes to have found his way out. A clone copy is supposed to help him out of his predicament. But an \"\"inexplicable\"\" error causes complications and Goal slips from our hero's reach once again. Now, he has to solve three major problems: He needs to find Goal again, reach Elysium and prevent the destruction of the entire planet of Deponia by the hand of the Organon. Three problems that only three Rufuses could solve \u2013 and thus, the luckless inventor decides to clone himself!

Negotiate your passage with local leaders, healers and warriors, or find yourself embroiled in a battle against nanite swarms, enormous scorpions and rocket-equipped robots. From thriving villages to crumbling cities, petrified forests and bone-dry ocean beds, this strange new world holds a multitude of terrains to uncover, beautifully rendered in 2D isometric art. Explore, solve puzzles and be prepared to face many tough choices that will shape this land long after you complete your journey. UNFORGETTABLE FACES Humanity as you know it has been totally reforged, and that is most evident by the characters in BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION. Technology and mortality have become blurred. Sentient religious robots run rife. Trans-humanistic tribes and leaders have emerged to claim power, and ruthless hunter mercenaries roam the plains. All have adapted to this powerful unknown, and are often at odds with each other. Meet and interact with over forty unique characters, each fully voiced by African voice actors, with thousands of lines of dialogue and multiple conversation paths. Additionally, full CGI cutscenes are scattered throughout the story to bring you even closer to the enthralling sci-fi world and its characters,\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_BeautifulDesolation_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/beautiful-desolation-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"9.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IkbdiJCrwo","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"85%","Completionist":"17","genre":"Role-Playing,Adventure,Strategy","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"30","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_BeautifulDesolation.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"360","BrazilPrice":"15.29","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/beautiful-desolation","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION","ESRBRating":"Mature","Publisher":"Untold Tales","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-28","Slug":"beautiful-desolation-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"79.99","ChilePrice":"","Price":"19.99","MexicoPrice":"66.56","MainExtra":"13","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"4.79","SCORE":"66","SaleEnds":"2022-05-16","LowestPrice":"3.74","SaleStarted":"2022-04-29","description":"Peaky Blinders: Mastermind is a puzzle-adventure game, based on the multi-award-winning BBC and Netflix TV show.

Together you can solve puzzles and fight over precious coins. Coordination and communication are key to a successful journey. We recommend using gamepads for maximum enjoyability.

Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack machine code and CPU registers to set it free. The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game. How does it play? You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features various types of puzzles: 1. Explore With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle. 2. Decipher programs Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those locations to get the program to do what you want. 3.\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"1.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I8Vlv9L9VM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"3","genre":"Puzzle,Education,Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.80","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_RogueBit.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"32.40","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Rogue Bit","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Bigosaur","ReleaseDate":"2019-03-21","Slug":"rogue-bit-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"7.60","ChilePrice":"","Price":"4.99","MexicoPrice":"19.99","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.98","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-16","LowestPrice":"2.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-25","description":"Enjoy 2 games in 1 with this irresistible speed games pack!

Everything changes, when they meet the mysterious Mama Dola, who seems to know more about Robert's destiny than Robert would like.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TheInnerWorldTheLastWindMonk_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-inner-world-the-last-wind-monk-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"6.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mP9kB5hAuM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":"11","genre":"Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"3.37","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TheInnerWorldTheLastWindMonk.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"29.55","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"The Inner World - The Last Wind Monk","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Headup Games","ReleaseDate":"2018-08-03","Slug":"the-inner-world-the-last-wind-monk-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"9","ChilePrice":"","Price":"14.99","MexicoPrice":"58.16","MainExtra":"8.5","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"4.02","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-31","LowestPrice":"3.19","SaleStarted":"2022-05-10","description":"While visiting a well renowned doctor, you notice something is amiss at his office.

The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles. Leveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area. Players are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far. The type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animus-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"4.5","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"65%","Completionist":"0","genre":"Action,Role-Playing,Arcade,Fighting","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"4.54","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"45.50","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"ANIMUS","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"TROOOZE","ReleaseDate":"2019-01-03","Slug":"animus-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"13.29","ChilePrice":"","Price":"7.99","MexicoPrice":"52.15","MainExtra":"5","SalePrice":"2.79"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.84","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-12","LowestPrice":"2.79","SaleStarted":"2022-04-21","description":"These are the days before Ire: Blood Memory, the days when Kerr the Breaker\u2019s evil slipped its way into Cadmeia.

A young man is dazing off while working the night shift at a convenience store, when a girl stops in to ask for a meat bun. The one next to her appears to be her boyfriend, and after doing their shopping, the two of them link arms affectionately and take off. Just when the young man is thinking how nice it would be to have a girlfriend, a pair of girls in ninja cosplay show up. The girls just stare at the shop goods without buying anything in particular. Even worse, they're even chatting about ninja techniques or something along those lines. When he calls out to them to prevent theft, it becomes apparent that they have no money. Despite suspecting that they might try to steal something, he gives in and buys a bento for the two desperately pleading girls.

On a late-night highway drive, a quiet train car in the early hours, a walk through a moonlight park, or the endless wait in a deserted airport, we listen to weird music amid the ambient announcements of delays and question our place in the universe. Inspired by long travel and the stream of consciousness it fosters, Glitchhikers asks you to look inward. Find the answers to your questions and question the answers you receive. Ruminate on life, the universe, our place and purpose in it. Voyage through a freeform narrative experience, converse with the endless inevitability, and explore the cosmic, hopeful world you find yourself in. A follow up to the critically praised short game released in 2014, Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between is an expanded experience, reborn and reimagined.
