The story takes place in the land of Rin during the height of the Age of Sail, following the events that would lead to the greatest war in human history. STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin. POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history. CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle. PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total. This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for.","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"game?id=103890","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png?w=200","MainStory":"26½","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4127-CUSA28517_00-R3PUS00000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8e4bk3jh0U","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"36½","genre":"Adventure, Role Playing Games","PlusPrice":13.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/rise-of-the-third-power","sgPlusPrice":"","Title":"Rise of the Third Power","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2022-02-10","Slug":"rise-of-the-third-power-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"MainExtra":"31","SalePrice":13.99,"IsPS4":1},{"HongKongPrice":"","hkPlusPrice":"","SCORE":"79","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","SingaporePrice":"","description":"Experience a dreamlike odyssey in virtual reality.

Enter a labyrinth that moves as you move, where mastering the elements is key to defeating enemies and uncovering the mysteries of this underground world. With a new experience awaiting every time you enter the dungeon, let the power bestowed by the crown guide you in this challenging adventure! Procedurally Generated Maze The procedurally-generated maze ensures you have a different experience every time you enter the dungeon. But unlike traditional open maps, Crown Trick locks you inside a small dungeon room to do battle with monsters. Without access to the entire map, you have no choice but to strategically decide how you will mount an attack on the enemy. Synchronous Turn-Based Strategy The game moves as you move, and your enemies will stand still until you decide what\u2019s the best way to attack. Take however long you need to map out your route, decide the best way to avoid traps, or how to use the elements to your advantage. A carefully thought out strategy is the key to escaping this dungeon alive. Use the Environment As you go deeper into the dungeon you will come across terrains mirroring a variety of elements that can be combined with your skills to deal heavy damage to the enemy. Throw fire on top of oil to burn monsters and mix lightning with water to electrocute your foes. There are a lot of lethal combinations to explore and use to slay monsters you encounter. Learn Skills from your Enemy Throughout your quest, you will encounter elite monsters, equipped with elite skills, known as Familiars. By defeating them you will gain access to their abilities, increasing your arsenal of skills you can unleash as you continue on to the next levels.

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike. There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series. This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians. Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields. It\u2019s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive \u2013 lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Just make sure you don\u2019t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies! The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front), with a new game Isonzo coming soon with mountain warfare on the Italian Front! These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references. **Cross play supported between console platforms.**","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"game?id=53337","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202002/2812/7lTuF0Wo4f9DT4oMjxx2xks4.png?w=200","MainStory":"8½","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1676-PPSA02757_00-8251469094096997","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE32n9kUddU","PercentOff":"70%","genre":"Action, Shooter, Shooter","PlusPrice":5.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202002/2812/7lTuF0Wo4f9DT4oMjxx2xks4.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/tannenberg","sgPlusPrice":"","Title":"Tannenberg","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"M2H","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-15","Slug":"tannenberg-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":19.99,"SalePrice":5.99,"IsPS4":1},{"HongKongPrice":"","hkPlusPrice":"","SCORE":"61","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","SingaporePrice":"","description":"Take a trip down memory lane and relive the magical times of the 8-Bit era with a collection of Namco\u2019s hits and long-lost treasures in Namco Museum Archives Volume 2. ■Includes 11 titles!

The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man\u2019s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn\u2019t for the faint hearted! Looking for more WW1 action?

By completing missions you will unlock Cards and Tokens to upgrade your fighter's Hull, Shields, Energy Weapons and Missiles until you are able to go up against massive Capital Ships and single-handedly shift the tide of the war. In an interplanetary struggle where nobody is good or bad, you will experience Leon rising through the ranks, the meaning of \u201cnecessary evil\u201d, the cost of integrity and ultimately, what it means to take a stand. FEATURES Career mode - learn every skill you need to survive and triumph in the Redout Universe. Many Thriving Worlds - exotic locations, grandiose events and epic battles beyond every frontier. Deep Gameplay - manifest your tactical superiority by putting your dexterity, quick thinking and adaptability to the test. Bigger, Badder Weapons - From Plasma Cannons to Shock Rays, Railguns, Scattershot, Air-To-Air Missiles, and Loadup Gatlings, a vast array of weapons is at your disposal. Choose, upgrade, and even install multiple instances on your ship. Pimp my Ride - upgrade your spaceship to scale it up: let them come by the dozens, or single-handedly take on a Destroyer Warship! Drop and swap Cards to improve single aspects of your ship and better fit your style. Music for your ears - An entirely dynamic soundtrack that will drop sicker and sicker beats the tougher the experience gets! LOTS TO DO IN SPACE Fight enemy Drones, Fighters and all sorts of enemy ships in rail shooter sections: avoid missiles and buckets of bullets while you take them down one by one. Explore Iridium mines and abandoned space structures in search of hideouts, resources, and Rebels: enjoy the freedom of movement, cut your engine power to squeeze through narrow passages, but be careful not to scratch your paintwork. Race through enemy installations, behind enemy lines, through gigantic space battles, or against space pirates for a quick buck. Assault Capital Ships in specially designed missions that pit you against gigantic vessels: each with unique strengths, weaknesses and special attacks, each a turning point in the narrative of the game! FAST-PACED SPACE ACTION Redout: Space Assault comes with the Redout Adrenaline seal-of-quality. Every ship movement, from rolling to avoid missiles to pushing the limits of your ship via the enhanced boost, will make you feel like you are actually driving a space-capable fighter jet, on the brink of control. You will not need to instantly become a top gun in order to enjoy the game, but you will definitely need some skill if you want to achieve all bonus objectives and max out your fighter stats!","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"game?id=67843","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202008/0608/Vg5biFANenqWUMucIgSptym5.png?w=200","MainStory":"9","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3800-CUSA14283_00-SPACEASSAULT0000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLYs4yBlBkQ","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Shooter, Arcade","PlusPrice":4.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202008/0608/Vg5biFANenqWUMucIgSptym5.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/redout-space-assault","sgPlusPrice":"","Title":"Redout: Space Assault","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"34BigThings srl","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-22","Slug":"redout-space-assault-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":9.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":4.99,"IsPS4":1},{"HongKongPrice":"","hkPlusPrice":"","SCORE":"51","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","SingaporePrice":"","description":"Eurian is a world at war.

Everything from the visuals to the audio to the gameplay was designed and tweaked and polished to create the most intense and satisfying twin-stick shooter experience possible. SYSTEM initializing... Multiple virus infections detected... Launching DEVASTATOR program... You are the Devastator! Your objective is to eradicate 15 types of viruses in 3 unique modes: Quadrants, Sectors, and Cycles. In Quadrants, the wave layout is constantly changing as you battle increasingly intense waves of random viruses for 5 minutes. In Sectors, there are 55 unique waves of viruses across 5 sectors. And in Cycles, you'll battle semi-randomized spawning viruses across 5 variations of 11 waves. Complete your objective as the Devastator and take back control of the System! In addition to the main game modes, wave layouts, and various enemy virus types providing gameplay variety, Devastator's moment-to-moment gameplay contains surprising depth and subtlety. From the way you balance speed vs. firepower to the utilization of resources to knowing when to pick up powerups, Devastator rewards both fast reflexes and good strategy. Devastator features vector-inspired visuals mixed with HDR colors, five customizable full-screen filters and mesmerizing particle effects, all while running at insanely high framerates on high-resolution monitors. With modern graphics hardware, the game runs with ease on current high-end gaming monitors (such as 360hz at 1080p, 240hz at 1440p, or 120hz at 4k), and it can theoretically run faster at higher resolutions when better monitors and higher-throughput video cables exist in the future. Devastator was designed and developed by Luke Schneider (aka the Radiangames guy). Luke has been a huge twin-stick shooter fan since the 1980s, and has been developing twin-stick shooters since 2005. With Devastator, Luke decided it was time to make his ultimate and final 2D arcade-style twin-stick shooter. Devastator features include: * Ultra-high resolution and ultra-high framerates support - 4k 120hz, 1440p 240hz, 1080p 360hz, etc. * 3 different game modes - Quadrants, Sectors and Cycles, each with their own unique pacing and feel * 15 unique virus types to battle against * 55 unique waves across 5 sectors * Powerful power-up drops * Ever-changing wave layouts * Ultra-satisfying twin-stick shooting gameplay - that rewards you for your mastery and variety of tactics * Beautiful HDR, particle-laden graphics - with 5 unique filters and tons of customization options * Heart-pounding soundtrack and intense retro-styled sounds that enhance your experience","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"game?id=106158","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/1710/1gqL4Ug4yGbYpWNldzG2WD1a.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1249-PPSA03002_00-7506945076104177","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":2.79,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/1710/1gqL4Ug4yGbYpWNldzG2WD1a.png","OpenCriticURL":"","sgPlusPrice":"","Title":"Devastator","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"2AWESOME STUDIO VOF","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-25","Slug":"devastator-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":6.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":3.49,"IsPS4":1},{"HongKongPrice":367.16,"hkPlusPrice":999999,"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","SingaporePrice":66.33,"description":"Embark on an epic adventure full of whimsy, wonder, and high-powered weaponry!

Blood-red eyes, charcoal-black scales, prominent spikes, and jagged, uneven teeth characterise this impressive species. Known for its aggressive nature, it was originally deemed unfit for display\u2026until now. MONOLOPHOSAURUS Named for the single crest adorning its skull, the Monolophosaurus is a medium-sized carnivore from the mid-Jurassic period. Its distinguished crest helps intensify roars and aids communication between Monolophosauruses. OURANOSAURUS (Variant) The Ouranosaurus is a peaceful herbivore that lives in large herds. Keeping a single Ouranosaurus is not advised, as lone individuals have been known to break out of their enclosures and panic guests. The Ouranosaurus has a broad snout and tall spines on its back supporting a camel-like hump. KENTROSAURUS (Variant) Despite being covered in lethal-looking spikes, the Kentrosaurus is actually a docile herbivore that uses its beak to bite off plant material. One of the smallest species of stegosaur, the Kentrosaurus defends itself when threatened using long spikes on each shoulder and smaller spikes protruding from its hips and tail. 8 NEW DINOSAUR SKINS Bring the Baryonyx trio Grim, Limbo and Chaos, plus Toro the Carnotaurus, Bumpy the Ankylosaurus, and Big Eatie the Tyrannosaurus Rex to life in your parks, and entrance your guests with two glow-in-the-dark skins inspired by the Parasaurolophus Lux. · 1 Ankylosaurus skin - Bumpy · 3 Baryonyx skins - Grim, Limbo, Chaos · 1 Carnotaurus skin - Toro · 2 Parasaurolophus Lux skins - Lux 1 (glow in the dark), Lux 2 (glow in the dark) · 1 Tyrannosaurus rex skin - Big Eatie","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2115/VlZzWssgw9IYJNxeFk6f82rW.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2514-PPSA03287_00-CAMPCRETACEOUSPK","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":"","genre":"Simulation, Strategy","PlusPrice":7.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2115/VlZzWssgw9IYJNxeFk6f82rW.png","OpenCriticURL":"","sgPlusPrice":"","Title":"Jurassic World Evolution 2: Camp Cretaceous Dinosaur Pack","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"Frontier Developments PLC","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-08","Slug":"jurassic-world-evolution-2-camp-cretaceous-dinosaur-pack-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":9.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":7.49,"IsPS4":1},{"HongKongPrice":609.7,"hkPlusPrice":609.7,"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","SingaporePrice":107.18,"description":"THIS ROSTER OF LEGENDS IS JUST TOO SWEET Take over with the WWE 2K22 nWo 4-Life Edition, which includes playable nWo Superstars & more.

Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny. In Evertried, the player\u2019s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don\u2019t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"game?id=98461","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4127-CUSA28069_00-EVERTRIEDPS4US00","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImOYOo4RR4","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"","genre":"Strategy, Strategy, Strategy","PlusPrice":11.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202109/0802/NhLhojI3575elpiQO334zezs.png","OpenCriticURL":"","sgPlusPrice":"","Title":"Evertried","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-21","Slug":"evertried-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":19.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":11.99,"IsPS4":1},{"HongKongPrice":"","hkPlusPrice":"","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","SingaporePrice":"","description":"This little addition for ATOM RPG is mainly aimed at those, who already own the game, but wish to support our indie studio a bit more nonetheless.

Fight countless enemies with a huge selection of gun turrets (in the form of comic heroes) and additional helpers (mines, air support, block wall) on more than 60 maps. Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

Forget everything you know about first-person shooters: Void Bastards asks you to take charge, not just point your gun and fire. Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you\u2019ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage... Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship\u2019s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don\u2019t worry though, as any crafting progress you\u2019ve made is retained from one to another.

Following the arrest of a prominent community leader, New York stands in disarray. Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as \u2018Shard\u2019 spreads throughout the underworld. With the city\u2019s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city\u2019s fate. Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to die\u2026 unless you decide they must. Key Features: Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it\u2019s sneaking through levels or attacking head-on Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle A reactive story where the player\u2019s choices have real consequences Stylized pixel art environments and characters Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley Gameplay: Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them. Tackle encounters in lethal, high-octane combat, or use your wits to stick to the shadows, utilizing distraction techniques and non-lethal attacks to reach your objective. Augmentation: Unlock cybernetic upgrades to augment your abilities via upgrade trees, and build upon your playstyle to improve your stealth or increase the lethality of attacks through talent trees. Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground. Reactive Story: Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld. Crush entire factions or convince them to aid your cause. Your destiny is yours to write. The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America\u2019s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2660-CUSA23291_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":8.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png","OpenCriticURL":"","sgPlusPrice":"","Title":"Disjunction - Digital Deluxe Edition","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-28","Slug":"disjunction--digital-deluxe-edition-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":17.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":8.99,"IsPS4":1},{"HongKongPrice":"","hkPlusPrice":"","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","SingaporePrice":"","description":"The year is 50 B.C.

People often speak of the tears of a clown, of the sadness that lies beneath the greasepaint smile. What if that wasn\u2019t sadness, but a deep malevolence, born of a life spent in the pursuit of drink and gluttony? A mind that sees others only as vessels for torture, and reduces their bodies down to a single finger, a trophy to be added to a collection? For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on. Kate Denson\u2019s smile is genuine, friendly and warm. She sings of love and life, family and hope. She holds those values dear, and will fight anyone who tries to destroy them.

However, she was kicked out by Yoshimitsu, the head of the Manji Clan, since she repeatedly stole for her own benefit. Later on, she tried to steal the sword called \u201cYoshimitsu\u201d from Yoshimitsu for her grandfather, who was a swordsmith. In the end, she was unable to steal the sword, and her grandfather passed away. She lost all desire to steal the sword, and vanished from Yoshimitsu\u2019s sight. Later on, she married a shinobi, and was blessed with a daughter. As time went on, her daughter grew to be a better ninja than her parents.

One day, Kunimitsu got a call that her mother\u2019s condition had worsened. She rushed to see her bedridden mother and heard the story of the only thing that her mother could not obtain in the past.

Like the games that inspired it, Petal Crash features a variety of single player challenges in addition to an intense head-to-head versus mode. The rules are simple - push a block in any direction, and it'll keep going until it hits a wall or another block. If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage! Enter the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire. Eons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia. Each of them has their own wish, and their own story to tell. Challenge the Story Mode to take your chosen character through their tale, challenging all the others in fierce puzzle battles to assemble all seven Sacred Blossoms!

An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers. Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these \"flying soldiers\" can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these \"characters\", they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance. Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help. It's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0306/XAwIPNpQTUn2Orp1uzkGd0WY.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4035-CUSA20600_00-FLYINGBASEGAME00","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":"","genre":"Family, Puzzle, Unique","PlusPrice":3.95,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0306/XAwIPNpQTUn2Orp1uzkGd0WY.png","OpenCriticURL":"","sgPlusPrice":"","Title":"Flying Soldiers","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"Wild Sphere S.L.","ReleaseDate":"2020-09-17","Slug":"flying-soldiers-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":17.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":4.49,"IsPS4":1},{"HongKongPrice":"","hkPlusPrice":"","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","SingaporePrice":"","description":"Ride off the beaten track!

Join TY on a RIPPER of an adventure to free his family from the DREAMING and stop the nefarious evil genius BOSS CASS from removing mammals from the top of the food chain. To help you on your quest, you've got a BEAUT arsenal of boomerangs, sharp teeth, and the help of a few friends! So don\u2019t be a galah - let's head down under, and have a CORKER of a time! BEAUTY, BOTTLER, BONZA! * Explore 17 levels of the Australian Outback in their old-school 3D platforming glory * 13 different boomerangs including the Frostyrang, Flamerang and powerful Doomerang * Improved camera & graphics; including updated shadows, reflections, HD resolutions and 60fps * New Gamemode called \"Hardcore Mode\" * New TY character skins * Audio Director's cut * Over 35 Trophies, including a Platinum Trophy, plus Speed Run and Time Attack Leaderboards. * * * * * G'day mate! Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open! Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie. Now let's get down to brass tacks, find those Talismans, and rescue your family!","SaleStarted":"2022-08-31","LowestPrice":"game?id=10738","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1404/yxKq7R9s7eOf0aAyJvubLHnS.png?w=200","MainStory":"8½","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5452-CUSA20268_00-7582797769000002","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVgrtF9Tx2E","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"15","genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":14.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/1404/yxKq7R9s7eOf0aAyJvubLHnS.png","OpenCriticURL":"","sgPlusPrice":"","Title":"TY the Tasmanian Tiger HD","ESRBRating":"","Publisher":"KROME INTERACTIVE","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-25","Slug":"ty-the-tasmanian-tiger-hd-playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":"12½","SalePrice":14.99,"IsPS4":1},{"HongKongPrice":"","hkPlusPrice":"","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-15","SingaporePrice":"","description":"\u201cNeed a packet?\u201d is a horror-simulator about supermarket cashier, who is gradually losing her mind from routine work.

You must grab, pull and drop objects to get to the goal bottle. On the way you will find different kinds of obstacles that need to be dealt with. The story of the game begins in the 50s, somewhere in rural America, where one particularly strong minded baby is taking his first steps and discovers that anything is possible. Especially as he seems to have an infinitely stretchy arm. Grab the Bottle follows the life of this boy, from cradle to grave, solving many levels of puzzles inspired by \u201creal life problems\u201d on the way.
