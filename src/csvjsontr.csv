"85","2024-10-23","Return to Monkey Island is an unexpected, thrilling return of series creator Ron Gilbert that continues the story of the legendary adventure games The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’. Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory. Return to Point & Click Swashbuckling Bringing classic point-and-click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze. Embark on Archipelago Adventures Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike. Created by a Legendary Crew The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights & Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).","2024-10-08","/game/109863","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/1822/9EgpieO87hFjIvMIxiUtLPnr.png?w=200","10","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3643-PPSA10123_00-RTMIPS5SIEE00000","50%","16","Adventure","999999","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/return-to-monkey-island","Return to Monkey Island","TRD","Devolver Digital","2022-11-08","return-to-monkey-island-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","879.00","11","439.50","0","",

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity’s last line of defense. Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF. As their different experiences interweave with each other, it is only then that you will reveal the full story and unlock all the mysteries of a Brain Punk future caught between technology and psychic abilities in SCARLET NEXUS.

STORY DRIVEN - Join a party of eight, each with their own unique ambitions, perspectives and personalities as they embark upon a suicide mission to topple the Arkadyan emperor, Dimitri Noraskov. A blend of humor, drama and tragedy await players as they navigate the treacherous world of Rin. POLITICAL INTRIGUE - As the world of Rin recovers from the Great War, the balance of power remains badly skewed, with vacuums of power still waiting to be filled. The player's party will be both beset and aided by schemers, liars and betrayers, all while the clock ticks down to a reprise of the greatest war in human history. CUSTOM BATTLE SYSTEM - Rise of the Third Power offers eight playable characters in a battle system built from scratch, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, all of whom are meant to participate in battle simultaneously without the need for tedious party management. Combine each character's unique powers and disadvantages, analyze the abilities of your foes, set your formation and charge into battle. PERSISTENT EQUIPMENT - Each piece of equipment found, purchased or stolen is a permanent, unique upgrade for each character. Instead of purchasing replacements, the player purchases upgrades. No more buying that awesome helmet back in town only to stumble over a better one as treasure in a dungeon. Each character has 3 equipment slots with 8 upgrades each, with 192 to find in total. This system avoids the tedium of inventory management, while also giving the completionist something useful to hunt for.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/2006/gbnic2cD5weAmNidgsezFlOp.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3919-CUSA28518_00-R3PEU00000000000","40%","0","Adventure, Role Playing Games","349.5","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/rise-of-the-third-power","Rise of the Third Power","TRD","DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","2022-02-09","rise-of-the-third-power-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","419.40","1","",

"77","2024-10-23","Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment. DRIVE TO SURVIVE It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows. INVESTIGATE THE ZONE The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you. REPEAT Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.","2024-10-08","/game/113597","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0710/516003921755aa5cb8873cb08c22b172141e997a0d5cd075.png?w=200","20","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6847-PPSA17476_00-00000000000PS5EU","40%","46","Driving/Racing, Action","629.4","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/pacific-drive","Pacific Drive","TRD","Kepler Interactive Limited","2024-02-21","pacific-drive-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","30","629.40","0","",

Venture forth as Sister Semilla to burn down the pillars of heresy in Minoria, an action-platformer by the creators of Momodora. The story takes place during the fourth Witch War. It is a time of fanatical religious fervor. The Sacred Office, a powerful organization leading an Inquisition against heresy, purges the sinners who threaten humanity. Those responsible for conducting a mysterious ceremony that contradicts the rules of the Church are labeled “witches.” Now, Sisters Semilla and Fran, missionaries in the Church’s service, set out to thwart the witches’ ceremony and protect the common-folk from heresy that endangers the status quo. Minoria is the latest and most ambitious game from Bombservice and a spiritual sequel to the Momodora series. Fans of Momodora will find familiar aspects in the design and gameplay elements, as they master the ins-and-outs of parries, dodges, and a variety of different spells. Now in HD format, with aesthetics mixing 2D hand-painted backgrounds and cel-shaded characters, Minoria continues Bombservice’s legacy on consoles. ・A powerful fantasy story inspired by the history of medieval Europe ・A unique visual aesthetic combining hand-painted 2D art with cel-shading ・Fluid controls encouraging careful engagement and patient play ・Combat enabling players to crush enemies with a mix of swordplay and spells ・Defensive options including dodge-rolls and parries ・A leveling system that helps players adjust to their desired difficulty","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202008/1116/y8xu61l5tRszPlYGZBJSS8GG.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3919-CUSA19047_00-MINORIAEU0000000","50%","0","Role Playing Games, Action","294","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/minoria","Minoria","TRD","DANGEN ENTERTAINMENT","2020-09-09","minoria-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","735.00","0","367.50","1","",

"73","2024-10-23","ENDLESS™ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESS™ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her ""unusual"" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESS™ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again. Japanese voice audio will become available as a free add-on as of 18th January 2024.","2024-10-08","/game/94132","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0605/dB3y1OVqMzjjFtPcJtTpX5D4.png?w=200","13","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0177-PPSA02665_00-ENDLESSDUNGEON00","25%","0","Strategy, Action","524.25","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/endless-dungeon","ENDLESS™ Dungeon","TRD","SEGA EUROPE LTD","2023-10-19","endless-dungeon-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","21","524.25","1","",

"72","2024-10-23","Get together with a loved one, a group of friends or even the whole family and guide teams of two or four robots through increasingly-complex levels to their color-coded goals. But beware! The path through each level is littered with cunning death traps that quickly send the automatons to the big scrapyard in the sky. One false step can trigger a hidden spike, lethal laser beam or other dangers which will send the entire squad back to square one. To progress, players must work together to learn each stage through trial and error, putting newly-gained knowledge into action to survive and succeed. In addition to the two-player story mode, Death Squared includes insane 'party chaos' challenges specifically designed for groups of four. A single-player can also enjoy the traditionally two-player story mode, and two-players can tackle 'party chaos', by controlling two robots with one controller.

Do you do favours for other inmates earning money and boosting their opinion of you along the way? Or workout and become stronger? Read to increase your skills or spend your time crafting items into homemade weapons and tools. What about working diligently in your prison job, to gain promotions to new jobs with better benefits?

Blending the viciously over-the-top gunplay of its predecessor with the elegant precision of the powerful katana, Shadow Warrior is an imaginative take on the classic arcade-style shooter. Shadow Warrior tells the offbeat tale of Zilla Enterprise’s corporate shogun Lo Wang as he is ordered to acquire a legendary blade of limitless power by his deceitful employer. Betrayed and left for dead, Lo Wang learns of the blade’s connection to ancient gods from another realm preparing to push our world to the brink of destruction. Now the reluctant hero must become legend through a masterful combination of gun, blade, magic and wit to uncover the truth behind the demonic invasion and banish evil back into the darkness. 1 player 8GB minimum save size DUALSHOCK®4 Vibration Function HD Video Output 720p,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Excavate the bedrock, reap the rewards of Mother Earth, and trade the mined valuables for new gadgets, travels, funky wild fashion, and more. Cave Digger 2: Dig Harder is a 1-4-player VR action-adventure game set in wildland valleys, where you discover old mines, nautical caves, and ruins of ancient civilizations inspired by Western, Dieselpunk and Lovecraftian themes. Explore the ""pristine"" lands, loot its riches, and unravel the mystery linked to a great explorer. As you go, it's best to keep a six-shooter nearby just in case.

Your goal is simply to mine and carry loot back to the surface the best you can for your mission assigners. With the surplus reward that you get, you can buy new things like upgrading your dependable pickaxe with a shinier look! (And faster digging rate.) Or buy dynamites that work on pretty much anything that needs to be worked on. Maybe you fancy a shovel that works for both digging and moving through the caves like a spider-miner. Whatever your preferred loadout, you will be ready to go deeper into the ever-shifting caves than any miner before or after you! Story The valleys have their mysteries and they hide them well. Step by step the player follows the same path where a great explorer has once wandered. Who is this hardy explorer? Why did he come to these valleys? And where is he now? The answers to these and more lie in the depths of the valleys. The story has multiple endings, each revealing a different side of it. Find the scattered comic pages to a tale of greed, eldritch power, and secrets beyond space and time. Who the wanderer is and why he did what he did in the valleys become clear in the end. But is it really the end? Co-op Multiplayer Gather a party of up to 4 players. Your role in the mining team is totally up to you! As long as at least somebody is carrying their weight in gold back to the surface, you all get paid in official Merchant Dollars equally. Co-op crossplay supports public matchmaking and private groups, and you are very free to show your wildlands drip by combining from a generous selection of clothes, hats and faces once you've bought them first! So, take a pickaxe (and your friends) with you and head to the wildlands for the riches it holds, find out the secrets it contains, and dig deeper into the valleys than any adventurer before or after you!

Play as Gaia, the Spirit of Life, and navigate stunning platforming environments in an abstract world to salvage the souls of extinct animals. Revive these creatures after learning their final fate: the last whale harpooned, the final eagle caged, the last deer hunted down, and more, while you survive encounters with dangerous, oil-covered Devourers that roam the wasteland in search of remaining life. In this emotional journey from the creators of the critically acclaimed Arise: A Simple Story, you alone can restore life to the planet. Key Features: • Gaia’s journey: the last animals have died, and Mother has used all of her Life Force to save their souls, now trapped in their vessels. Gaia’s quest is to rescue each of their souls and bring them back to Mother’s Ark. Gaia’s traversal abilities will allow you to glide, jump, and dash to explore new areas and evade deadly traps, while her special gifts will grant you the power to clear the oil that consumes the world, face hungry Devourers, and break souls free. • A vast, surrealistic world: see through Gaia’s eyes the desolated landscapes that depict the destructive relationships between humans and nature in a beautiful demonstration of abstract artistry. From dying forests to the heart of crumbling cities, through the dry seabed and polluted skies, each environment will offer new challenges for Gaia to face and will present her different versions of the Devourers’ wake of destruction as she spreads life and beauty on her path. • A story of contrasts: After Us offers a somber look at a world decimated by human impact. As you guide Gaia’s light through it and discover the causes behind the destruction, you will learn the fate of the Devourers as agents of extinction, but also agents of progress, love, and hope.","2024-10-08","/game/118233","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202304/0312/293739904a7a7ce07856d5e3324f6e3dcd1e3602fb442425.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4829-PPSA07949_00-AFUS00000000SIEE","50%","11","Adventure","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/after-us","After Us","TRD","TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE UK","2023-05-23","after-us-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1925.00","11","962.50","0","",

"63","2024-10-23","Alone in the Dark weaves a chilling tapestry of psychological horror and Southern Gothic charm, reimagining the iconic game that set the benchmark for the genre. We invite you to join us on a journey into madness, where each encounter could be your last. With each step you take closer to unravelling Derceto's mystery, the eyes that watch from the darkness grow hungrier. Every bullet means the difference between survival and an unthinkable end. The next door you unlock could lead to a nightmarish realm offering nothing but slashing claws, grasping tentacles, and frayed sanity. Journey to interbellum Louisiana, where an era of decadence hides a darker tale - of escape from past traumas and an intolerant society, into the waiting grasp of something darker, something that has patiently lurked for impossible eons. This is Alone in the Dark as you've never seen it - a skillfully-woven narrative of Southern Gothic elegance and eldritch madness that pays homage to its legendary origins while taking the next step forward in survival horror storytelling. A Haunting Tale of Mystery and Madness Step inside Derceto Manor, an asylum shrouded in intrigue, guarding a terrible secret. Client Emily Hartwood and private investigator Edward Carnby embark on a harrowing quest for answers; Emily to the mystery of her missing uncle, Edward to the toughest case he will ever face, and both to questions they dare not ask themselves. This re-envisioned classic invites you to explore an unforgettable single player adventure rich with suspense, frights, and revelations that will test the limits of your imagination. Featuring Hollywood Talent Experience some of the greatest acting survival horror has ever seen through the performances of award-winning actors Jodie Comer (Killing Eve, Free Guy) and David Harbour (Stranger Things, Black Widow) in their first videogame roles. Jodie and David’s immaculately captured likenesses breathe life into Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby, lending a deeply personal aspect to Alone in the Dark’s story that demands it be played twice to get the full experience. A Tribute to Horror Pioneers Rediscover the essence of psychological horror in a game that respectfully nods to its 1992 origin, the game that established the survival horror genre. Alone in the Dark is your gateway to an experience steeped in the atmospheric dread of classic horror, with next-generation storytelling and gameplay. A must-play for fans of twisted tales, nerve-wracking exploration, and desperate combat. A Story That Challenges Reality Envisioned by Mikael Hedberg, acclaimed writer behind modern horror classics “SOMA” and “Amnesia”, Alone in the Dark’s intricate web of mystery delves into themes of trauma, faith, evil, and abandonment. Whether you choose to brave the nightmare as Emily or Edward, you will uncover secrets that defy everything you thought about videogame storytelling.","2024-10-08","/game/112498","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/1015/b3a91fa43661ced3d57a908c26f5bfab057584343be6f618.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4389-PPSA08135_00-ALONEINTHEDARKEU","30%","18","Horror, Adventure, Puzzle","1364.35","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/alone-in-the-dark","Alone in the Dark","TRD","THQ NORDIC GMBH","2024-03-20","alone-in-the-dark-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","10","1469.30","0","",

IMPORTANT HEALTH WARNING ABOUT PLAYING VIDEO GAMES Photosensitive seizures A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these “photosensitive epileptic seizures” while watching video games. These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eyes or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects. Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms – children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures. The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions: sit farther from the screen, use a smaller screen, play in a well-lit room, do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued. If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1202/z5tGmstkqZ5YZ8U4DvKNcpbZ.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0700-CUSA11932_00-LOA0000000000001","75%","0","Unique","209.8","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/twin-mirror","Twin Mirror","TRD","DON'T NOD ENTERTAINMENT SARL","2020-11-30","twin-mirror-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","262.25","1","",

"51","2024-10-23","The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™ follows the Dwarves as they embark on a new adventure to reclaim their legendary home of Moria beneath the Misty Mountains. Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as mysterious dangers await. Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria—known as Khazad-dûm or Dwarrowdelf—in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there’s clatter, there’s combat. Excavate the mysteries of three legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within. Key Game Features: ● Feel the Fellowship: Experience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. ● Survive the Dark: To survive the treacherous Mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain. ● Base Building: Find solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to destroy Dwarven progress. ● Rebuild and Reshape Moria: Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dûm to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses. Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources. ● Explore: Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger, providing a unique experience each and every time. ● Co-op Multiplayer: Adventure alone or band together with friends in online cooperative multiplayer. ● Craft Dwarven Tools, Weapons and More: Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor, tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines. ● Uncover Magic Artifacts: Discover ancient magic items including swords that glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom. ● Mine Ore and Jewels: Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril. Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear. But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness. ● Comprehensive Dwarf Builder: Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator. Dwarves can be customized in a variety of ways to create a unique Dwarven identity. Then, during gameplay, players can find and craft armor and weapons to further enhance their unique style.","2024-10-08","/game/109177","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0520/d7bb0cab42052c1946d6fdcf236f059ee850819f9008843c.png?w=200","35","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7581-PPSA16618_00-0277621140622233","30%","83","Adventure","612.5","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria","The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™","TRD","North Beach Games","2023-12-04","the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","48","612.50","0","",

Set in a sprawling urban environment, the game challenges you to navigate the complexities of street life with limited resources and constant dangers. Your journey begins with nothing but the clothes on your back. Beg for money from strangers to gather enough resources to survive another day. But begging isn’t your only option—you’ll need to think on your feet and make tough decisions. Whether it's starting a fire to keep warm on cold nights or stealing from others when times are desperate, every action has consequences. As you progress through the levels, the stakes get higher. You’ll encounter law enforcement officers who see you as a nuisance and other street dwellers who are just as desperate as you are. Engage in intense street fights where only the strongest survive, and learn to outwit the cops who are always on the lookout for troublemakers. But it’s not just about survival—it's about making a life. Use your wits and skills to navigate through various challenges, from scavenging for food to finding safe spots to sleep. The city is your playground, and every alley, park, and street corner holds potential opportunities and dangers. The game’s realistic 3D graphics bring the gritty urban landscape to life, immersing you in the harsh realities of homelessness. From the cold, hard pavement to the towering skyscrapers, every detail is meticulously crafted to enhance the sense of realism. Street Survival: Homeless Simulator is not just a game; it’s a raw, unflinching look at the struggles faced by the homeless.

Eden Genesis is a platform game focused on fast-paced trials, quick reflexes, and a rich story in a cyberpunk world dominated by neon lights and corporations. Take control of Leah, a young cyborg lady, and overcome challenging trials to liberate her corrupted mind! A cyberpunk adventure In the not-so-distant future, corporations rule the world providing ways of increasing the physical and intellectual capabilities of the common folk, at a high price... Those who wear cybernetic implants are doomed. Their lifetime is coming to an end in a matter of time, but luckily for them, there may still be hope. The biggest tech conglomerate just announced a promising solution for this terrible disease!

Overcome the trials to unlock your full mind potential and eliminate the corruption born from the implants that are destroying your neurons. Game mechanics Fast-paced gameplay - Eden Genesis offers a wide world full of trials that require anticipation, quick reflexes, and nerves of steel. These sections contain both environmental and enemy hazards, besides frantic platforming puzzles. Players must overcome them to cure the illness suffered by the protagonist. Responsive controls - The game features an intuitive level design for the players to enjoy precise movement controls. As you become more skilled and Leah liberates more neuron links, Eden Genesis allows you to get even faster completion times every time you enter a trial. In a game with such scale and platforming, responsive controls are a must-have, allowing precise movement and combat. A balanced platformer - While any player will be able to reach the end of the game and complete the main story and numerous secondary phases, it is true that Eden Genesis offers some extra content for demanding players.

However, the main playable and exploration core is designed to be accessible to all players. Deep story - Eden Genesis features a stunning plot including philosophic themes and debates about what makes us humans and the limits of science and technology. As every good cyberpunk story does, Eden Genesis makes the player question reality, and have uncertainty about the future.

Deadlink is a guns-blazing cyberpunk FPS with roguelite elements. You're the first operative to be recruited to the experimental Deadlink project. Pilot an autonomous combat shell, fighting your way through cramped slums, twisted labs, grimy warehouses, and sleek office buildings on a mission to thwart the schemes of the most powerful corporations in the world. Wield a deadly arsenal, upgrade your skills and tech, devastate destructible environments, and slash corporate profit margins — all at the same time. You are the Corporate Security Agency’s greatest weapon, and it's your job to make sure the corporations and their shady deals are anything but secure. With the team at HQ backing you up, you're tossed headfirst into the fray, where a military operation with plausible deniability can fix things for a fraction of the cost of a hopeless court case. Every randomized run will be different, but one thing never changes: you will be outnumbered. Get ready to think on your feet as you dash, jump, and use the environment to your advantage. You can't still, not even for a second. Equip your shell with powerful weapon loadouts. Try out various combinations as you blaze a path of destruction. Want to snipe your foes from a distance, debilitate them with status effects, or just go in guns blazing? Whatever your playstyle, you can find the right kit for the job. Your enemies have no shortage of bullets and bodies to throw at you. But you're no slouch either. Sure, you might lose a combat shell here and there, but your next one will be even tougher. Start each new run with amped-up skills and deadlier firepower!","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202406/1811/00a3dc838510f9d462ddfde9d782b2bcda16623f8202ad5a.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2627-PPSA22668_00-DEADLINKPS5BUNDL","20%","0","Shooter, Action","546.75","null","null","Deadlink - OST Bundle","TRD","Crunching Koalas Sp. z o.o.

"","2024-10-23","Block Tower TD is a roguelike tower defense strategy game with interesting innovations. Build a world out of blocks, choose random upgrades to make every run unique. CREATING THE WORLD The world consists of blocks that you can place anywhere. Thanks to this, you will be able to think over a defense plan. BUILD TOWERS Tower locations are the most important aspect in tower defense games. This aspect becomes even more valuable in Block Tower: you can build towers on high ground, leave free blocks for resource extraction or later strong towers. In addition, all towers have an experience bar, the earlier you build it, the stronger it will be in the late game. CHOOSE UPGRADES The order in which upgrades are chosen in each game is very important. You can choose resource-based upgrades, magic tower upgrades, or upgrades for strong early defense, which will allow you to safely move into the late game. Combined with randomly generated blocks, this gives infinite replay value. RESOURCE MINING Think over your economic strategy. Early construction of economic buildings is risky, but gives a big boost in the late game. The random location of resources in each game sets new strategic questions that you will have to answer each time.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202407/0912/c15bc2c51fabaa19796a0edfbebf59c23f924e1c77823200.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6138-CUSA48092_00-0303083378814996","20%","0","Strategy","153.6","null","null","Block Tower TD","TRD","Samustai LTD","2024-07-18","block-tower-td-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","192.00","0","153.60","1","",

A windsock wouldn’t probably hurt and some lights might turn out to be useful, since you will on occasion also need to help him land. Let’s see how things develop and what Joe is up to... The Plane Joe’s plane is like its pilot: old. It’s also simple. The most advanced technology on this thing is the LED reading light Joe uses to find his way on the chart. How hard can it be to fix some simple things on a small plane? And it’s not like you are doing it for free. The Gameplay The Airstrip DLC brings new game mechanics and content to Gas Station Simulator based on events. Unlike the content we introduced in the past, it does not require your constant attention, it is more something that happens every now and then.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202407/0116/5ebeaac5a35dc3cad39336686d17b2fad189756bb3b0b9de.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-0858195884524076","20%","0","Simulation","656.25","null","null","Gas Station Simulator, Airstrip DLC and Can Touch This DLC Bundle","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2024-07-11","gas-station-simulator-airstrip-dlc-and-can-touch-this-dlc-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","875.00","0","700.00","1","",

"","2024-10-23","Hand In Hand is a 2D split screen puzzle platformer, where the player can control two characters at once, or two players can play in co-op mode on one device. A TOUCHING STORY Two soulmates live in a fairytale world. But when evil came to their world, they lost each other. Now both of them need to head towards each other, facing many difficulties and dangers along the way. And only by finding a fragile connection between one another and going hand in hand will they be able to defeat evil and meet again. It's a story about how we can help one another even when you're apart, and be far from one another even when you're nearby. It's a story about the importance of relationships and mutual support. But every story has an even deeper meaning... SPLIT SCREEN The game works in splitscreen mode, with one character on each screen in their respective locations. The game has two modes. The first is single-player mode, where one player simultaneously controls both characters with one joystick. In this mode, the player must demonstrate sophisticated controller skills. The second is local co-op mode, where two players control the characters using two joysticks. Here, both players control their respective characters. Each mode has its advantages. Single-player mode requires you to show great dexterity and reaction speed, and co-op mode allows you to feel the joy of playing the game with your family or friend. Try both game modes, we hope you'll like it and enjoy completing it. THE CHARACTERS INTERACT WITH AND HELP EACH OTHER Each character has their own part of the level in a common location. However, some parts of the level are interconnected. This means that the characters can interact and help each other complete the level. Characters can move keys and objects from one part of the screen to another, and most puzzles are need to be solved by both characters working together, connecting parts of the screen and solving puzzles together. EPIC BOSSES The game has epic boss battles. Each boss represents the world of shadows that has invaded this fairytale forest and wants to plunge all the inhabitants of this fairytale world into the horror of eternal darkness. Our brave heroes, Lina and Minho, must defeat each of the bosses so that peace and prosperity will once again reign in the fairy forest.

Now, the food truck belongs to you. Will you walk in your father's footsteps and live up to his name? Only one way to find out. You can't take the 'truck' out of 'food truck'.

"","2024-10-23","Goons: Legends & Mayhem is a frantic blend of arcade hockey, beat 'em up, and sports action that will trigger couch co-op nostalgia. Players are thrown into an epic adventure to save Zambonia - a once quaint and prosperous kingdom where hockey is at the center of everything. Choose from one of eight unique characters divided into three classes - the attack-focused Sharpshooter, the defense-oriented Enforcer, and the Wingman who can focus on either supporting their team or harassing their opponents. 1-6 PLAYER ACTION Team up with another player in 2v2 hockey encounters against a single goaltender, or in a classic 3v3 mode to unleash full chaos. Communication is key, and your skills will make the difference between victory and defeat! 3 UNIQUE CLASSES, A BUNCH OF CHARACTERS Pick the right character to craft a team strategy that will allow you to shoot and (hopefully) score! Choose characters from the Sharpshooter (attack), Enforcer (defense), or Wingman (support) classes. Each character features their own abilities and unique traits allowing for long-lasting replayability. VERSUS MODE Pure PVP arcade hockey action with a twist. Matches that will take you back to the couch co-op era, while providing a more modern sports experience, with character classes and a goalkeeper that feels like a constant boss fight. Choose from local co-op, online with friends, or even multiplayer with complete randos! RELENTLESS GOALTENDERS Other players are not your only worry here, goalies will also do their best to ruin your best plays whenever possible. Be it long-range attacks, vicious mortar attacks, or melee charges, no expense is spared protecting the net. In Goons: Legends & Mayhem's story mode, goaltenders become literal boss fights, each of them teaching you how to master different hockey techniques, preparing you for your PVP skirmishes! EXCITING REALMS Goons offers a variety of environments to wreck your friends in, from the chilled coasts of a once-booming fish market, to the mythical realm of wizardry and legends. Each environment has its own special mechanics, environmental hazards, and goaltender to defeat. STORY MODE Embark on a journey to save the Hockeyverse! Play solo and defeat mascots while trying to save the world from the Great Mascoteer, who's trying to ruin hockey for everyone. Progress through the stages, unlock new characters, and investigate the turmoil that's wreaking havoc on this unique hockey universe! UNLOCKABLES, HUH?

Dragged from the glitz and glamor of 1940s New York City and thrust into a dilapidated farmhouse in the rural south, both are unsuccessful, struggling with their finances, and straining in their relationship. But when Loretta learns of her husband’s infidelity and a lucrative life insurance policy filed in his name, a grisly plan takes root. It is up to you to decide how far she should take it.

"","2024-10-23","INTRODUCING A CREATIVE SANDBOX BUILDING GAME: Bulwark is about designing your fortress and expanding it into an empire. I hope you enjoy my attempts to experiment and evolve this game into something enjoyable and fresh. Bulwark also continues to evolve with each passing update, based on your feedback. So positive or negative comments are welcome. If it’s intended to help then it’s all appreciated in the friendly discord. Story: You are in charge of the last remnants of free people on the Ursee, tasked with building a new home. Carve your path onto a world, tower by tower, wall by wall, sculpting from the daunting cliffs and perilous waters of an unforgiving landscape that refuses to be tamed. Game goals: Design fantastic ocean fortress settlements. Progress is simple, grow the populations of various factions and you will progress on their Soultrees. Unlocking commanders and captains that may work for you, unlocking new ships, units and abilities. Play Your Way: Bulwark - Explore the Great Ursee as you build your grand civilisation. Scavenge for resources,create trade routes and strike alliances with other factions scattered across the waves as you balance negotiation and conflict to grow your settlement. Freebuild - Enjoy a cosy ‘Freebuild Mode’, devoid of the conflict and challenges present in standard play, you can sketch and experiment without the need for resources, building without limits. Total Conquest - War has come to the Great Ursee. You start at war with every faction, diplomacy is disabled and the frequency and scale of raids is ramped up. It is no longer enough to just build - now you must survive. Building Resources: Wood, stone and Iron aren’t stored or tallied up, the only thing that counts is distance, not cost. You transport resources along your network of towers as well as trading routes over the sea. Towers and walls within range of the resource can be upgraded and built for free, those out of range cannot. Splinters : The currency that powers diplomacy, army building, buying new locations and unique buildings is separate from resources, it runs on a currency called, Splinters. You gain these through population growth, trade with other factions or as rewards from combat. Challenge: The game challenges you to design and grow grand fortresses, often at little cost other than setting up trade routes for resources. As you grow you may invite in populations from other factions which unlock faction unique content from their “soultree”. But everybody hates everybody on the Ursee and doing so might lead to war or to loyal allies that merge with your empire. This sandbox builder has consequences!","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202410/0816/96c7712151968f9ded120c7be411de8ab8bfbd1b13fbbdb0.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4382-PPSA16848_00-FALCONEERBULWARK","45%","0","Strategy","384.45","null","null","Bulwark Evolution: Falconeer Chronicles","TRD","WIRED PRODUCTIONS LIMITED","2024-03-26","bulwark-evolution-falconeer-chronicles-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","384.45","1","",

Welcome to Undermere, a quaint town surrounded by hag-infested forests and rugged mountains. You are the Horticulturist, owner of local plant store Strange Horticulture. As a cast of colorful customers come by your shop, you are quickly thrust into an occult mystery stretching back hundreds of years. Explore the lands beyond your store to find new plants, but be careful! The dark woods and lakes are not always friendly to a simple herbalist. You might discover powers beyond your wildest dreams - or lose your mind completely. Use context clues to determine which places to visit, and which to avoid! Using your trusty encyclopedia and clues found on your explorations, you learn more about the strange plants you come across. By identifying each plant, you will be able to use their effects to influence the story -- from hypnotic hallucinogens to powerful poisons.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/1409/19c9e547047a4e434156430316df698047b13df49aac5110.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3652-CUSA46010_00-0303144791987407","50%","0","Unique, Puzzle","279.5","null","null","Strange Horticulture","TRD","Iceberg Interactive BV","2024-02-23","strange-horticulture-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","559.00","0","279.50","1","",

You play as Airhead, a small Body and the round inflated organism it uses as a Head. And while Head is slowly but surely deflating, you have a chance to save its life. To do so, you must use air tanks to keep Head inflated while you explore Airhead’s metroidvania-style world, searching for amazing abilities and upgrades that will unlock new areas and puzzles for you to overcome. On your adventure, it will be up to you to uncover the true connection between Head, the air tanks, and the technology that litters the world, so you can save Head no matter the cost.

Now, Airhead must rely on air tanks to keep the Head inflated, while it searches far and wide for the machine that stole Head’s air source.

You play a deaf heroine plunging into danger in search of a cure. Plan up to six steps in advance to outmaneuver your opponents: wolfish creatures filled with hunger and rage. Various types of fiends are lurking in the shadows, each of them possessing different abilities and their own levels of vitality. So, you need to consider carefully the strategy that will bring them to their knees. Not only do you have your wits to rely on while plotting your attack, you also have an array of abilities at your disposal. As you slay more wolves, you acquire skills like Vault, Smoke Bomb, and Piercing Shot. Venture forth on your journey to upgrade your skills and unlock more Action Slots and Undo Round Points. As you plan your moves, you will also shape your own prophecy, composing a dynamic work of scripture as you fight. Howl's visuals are created through ""living ink"", a flowing art style that paints the story as you play. Carve your way through a dark, fairy-tale world made up of obscure yet magical places where you fight and write to rid the lands of the plague.

"","2024-10-23","The story begins with our young hero crash-landing on the shores of Thunder Island. In this treacherous yet tropically beautiful haven, he discovers an artifact of immense power. Upon realizing the true potential of the artifact, he embarks on a journey filled with challenges and hardships to unlock its full might. The island holds numerous perilous dungeons, some inhabited by ancient and terrifying bosses, while others house more misunderstood and talkative ones. To enhance his chances of conquering the island's challenges, our hero will acquire new skills, catch fish, cook nutritious meals, discover valuable treasures, and seek blessings from the many deities at the island's shrines. Many charming inhabitants reside on the island. Among them are merchants who are open to trade with our hero, while others will send him on adventurous quests, offering him handsome rewards in return. STORYTELLING: The game focuses on ""Humor and Fun"" in its story and character dialogues, as well as many popular references. Throughout the island, the protagonist will encounter many characters, including deities. Additionally, there are numerous lore-books that add depth and explain the broader world beyond the island. CHARACTER: Mogren is a resilient and fearless Orc. His journey through Thunder Island will introduce him to numerous challenges, and to overcome them, he must level up, learn skills, unlock new abilities, receive blessings, and eat the right food at the right time. DUNGEONS: Each dungeon has its own theme and a set of unique puzzles. For example, in one of them, you have to transform into a specific creature and play the entire dungeon in that form. The side dungeons, also known as ""Caves"", feature their own puzzles and encounters, providing players with a wide range of content variations. QUESTING: The main Questline sends the player on a journey to discover all of Thunder Island, Along the way, Mogren will encounter many inhabitants who require his assistance with various tasks. Mogren will happily, and sometimes begrudgingly, aid these individuals and receive generous amounts of XP and quest rewards in return. COLLECTING: The game also features a Collect-a-thon aspect, with cosmetic hats that add style and a sense of fashion to the character. The OST can be listened to in-game, but first the individual soundtracks must be found. And last but not least, there are the ""Crystal Clams"", which I will not spoil here.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/2517/778facb535312724534cbde64b00cba4cb73782f72fa3cb1.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5154-CUSA45949_00-0739752124365077","60%","0","Role-Playing","139.6","null","null","Shalnor Legends 2: Trials of Thunder","TRD","Johnny Ostad","2023-11-09","shalnor-legends-2-trials-of-thunder-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","349.00","0","139.60","1","",
"","2024-10-23","Start with a pickaxe in one hand and nothing in the other. Excavate the bedrock, reap the rewards of Mother Earth, and trade the mined valuables for new gadgets, travels, funky wild fashion, and more. Cave Digger 2 is a 1-4-player action-adventure game set in wildland valleys, where you discover old mines, nautical caves, and ruins of ancient civilizations inspired by Western, Dieselpunk and Lovecraftian themes. Explore the ""pristine"" lands, loot its riches, and unravel the mystery linked to a great explorer. As you go, it's best to keep a six-shooter nearby just in case. Tools and Progression Get thrown right away into the deep end by being stuck in the mines as your drill machine broke. With a single pickaxe, work your way to the surface camp where your journey can begin in earnest. Your goal is simply to mine and carry loot back to the surface the best you can for your mission assigners. With the surplus reward that you get, you can buy new things like upgrading your dependable pickaxe with a shinier look! (And faster digging rate.) Or buy dynamites that work on pretty much anything that needs to be worked on. Maybe you fancy a shovel that works for both digging and moving through the caves like a spider-miner. Whatever your preferred loadout, you will be ready to go deeper into the ever-shifting caves than any miner before or after you! Story The valleys have their mysteries and they hide them well. Step by step the player follows the same path where a great explorer has once wandered. Who is this hardy explorer? Why did he come to these valleys? And where is he now? The answers to these and more lie in the depths of the valleys. The story has multiple endings, each revealing a different side of it. Find the scattered comic pages to a tale of greed, eldritch power, and secrets beyond space and time. Who the wanderer is and why he did what he did in the valleys become clear in the end, but is it really the end? Co-op Multiplayer Gather a party of up to 4 players. Your role in the mining team is totally up to you! As long as at least somebody is carrying their weight in gold back to the surface, you all get paid in official Merchant Dollars equally. Co-op crossplay supports public matchmaking and private groups, and you are very free to show your wildlands drip by combining things from a generous selection of clothes, hats and faces once you've bought them first. So, take a pickaxe (and your friends) with you and head to the wildlands for the riches it holds, find out the secrets it contains, and dig deeper into the valleys than any adventurer before or after you!

TROUBLE ON BLOBOLONIA™ Team up with an extraterrestrial lifeform named Blobert (affectionately known as Blob) to save Blob’s home planet! The evil emperor of Blobolonia™ is threatening to rule the planet with his army of minions. Thwart his plans for total conquest while forging an unbreakable bond by using the power of jelly beans! Find hidden treasures across Blobolonia™ by discovering new secrets and gathering enough resources to buy new jellies. These tasty treats will give Blob the power to undergo miraculous transformations and help you save the world together. Sounds like a daunting task, right? Not with Blob by your side! Try different jellybean flavors to see what effect they have on Blob. Overcome obstacles by transforming Blob into the right tool for the job! This shape-shifting ability becomes their ultimate weapon, enabling them to conquer seemingly insurmountable challenges. With enough jellybeans and flavors, the possibilities are endless! THE RESCUE OF PRINCESS BLOBETTE Join the boy and his extraordinary companion, Blob, as they embark on a quest to save the beloved Princess Blobette from the clutches of the wicked Antagonistic Alchemist, who harbors grand ambitions of becoming Emperor of Blob’s home planet, Blobolonia™. But our heroes won't let that happen. Imprisoned within the tower of the Royal Castle, the fate of Princess Blobette hangs in the balance, and it's up to you to ensure her freedom. But the Alchemist has laid a suite of treacherous traps to impede the boy and Blob’s progress. Join our dynamic duo as they encounter secret rooms, clever traps, and dangerous obstacles in the labyrinthine depths of the castle. Fortunately, the Alchemist remains oblivious to our heroes’ hidden advantage—feeding Blob different flavors of jelly beans can transform him into various shapes. Armed with this knowledge, unlocking the tower's door becomes a mere trifle for our heroes, provided the right jelly bean is at hand. Blob’s ability to magically transform shapes will help this intrepid pair get past almost anything the Alchemist can conjure up!

What if you could buy them both at once, together in some sort of combined bundle? Does that calm you down a bit? Are you okay now? You were freaking us out a bit. But now that we’ve explained this bundle situation you’re looking a lot better. Mind if we continue? If you don’t know what you’re getting into, here’s the deal: High On Life is an action-packed comedy-adventure FPS filled with unhinged talking guns, an evil alien drug cartel selling humans on the black market, and an impressive variety of gorgeous and seedy spacefaring locales to explore. You wanna buy goop from a back-alley salesman? You wanna tell some construction workers that their dad will never love them? You wanna rescue a talking knife from a bunch of a gang of ant clones? You can do ALL of those things in High On Life, trust me. And a lot more. I didn’t even mention a lot of the other stuff you can do. And then there’s High on Knife, the meaty DLC centered around that talking knife I mentioned earlier. Knifey. His name’s Knifey, and this is his big adventure. He’s gonna find out all about the dark(?) mysterious(?) secrets(?) of his past as you take him and Harper, a brand new talking gun, to a salt-planet filled with dying slugs. And then from there maybe you’ll meet a giant guy, race some slow-as-hell slugs, or go for the high score in Peroxosquash with B.A.L.L., another new talking gun. We really packed this DLC full of new stuff, trust me. And we didn’t even get to the spooky parasite-filled shipping warehouse run by a ruthless, monstrous CEO. I should also mention that this bundle features an all-star cast of comedic voice talent guaranteed to put the “funny” back in “wouldn’t it be soooo funny if you bought this bundle right now?” We’ve got JB Smoove, Tim Robinson, Betsy Sodaro, Sarah Sherman, Michael Cusack, Gabourey Sidibe, and so many more who are now mad at me because I didn’t put their names in here but, look, I’ve got a word limit I’m working with.

Get ready to unleash chaos, earn fame, and have a blast! Are you ready to get famous? If so, grab your gun and join the most violent TV show in the history of violent TV shows! Participants will have to shoot, smash and rip through hundreds of enemies on their way to victory! Don’t be discouraged by THE GIANT BOSSES that are more than capable of turning your innards outwards – just grab the best perks and weapons along the way. Make your gun spew molten lava all over the floor, turn yourself into a berserker, and let your bullets bounce between enemies!

But who cares about death when your audience loves YOU? Unlike real life, here you can make good use of the likes you receive. Use your new-found fame to help upgrade every item and every perk to deal even more damage when you head out again. Oh, don’t worry about getting bored: every episode of the show is randomized so you’ll never have the same run twice in-a-row. And, when you are completely done with show business, invite your friends and party-up with co-op mode with up to four players!

Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That’s what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience unmatched. Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement. The Tightest Crew The legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. They've been ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake. In order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan. Give In to Your Greed Give your greed an outlet and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash, jewelry, and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics, and accolades. It won’t be as simple as showing up and gaining goodies. You’ll have to work hard and plan smart to get away with as much loot as possible. Gain experience, unlock new skills, and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges. The Art of the Heist A professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work, and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist; do you sneak or go in guns blazing? Do you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns? Do you go it alone or bring friends? The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays out. Thrive in Co-op Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends, whether you bring them along from your childhood or make them along the road. The PAYDAY series has always valued the bonds made through hardship and tries to reflect that in the actions and words of our heisters in the game, and also through our community outside the game. An account with Starbreeze Nebula is required to play PAYDAY 3.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2909/a1a027289fadb563ddc04c1a3ec0f2b7f4f9f8dd7fe378c2.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8459-PPSA14411_00-PAYDAY3GOLDSIEE0","60%","0","Shooter, Action","1259.6","null","null","PAYDAY 3: Gold Edition","TRD","PLAION","2023-09-21","payday-3-gold-edition-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","3149.00","0","1259.60","0","",

"","2024-10-23","Hustle and grift your way across America in the ‘90s as a teenage con artist on a crime-filled road trip adventure. Play as Ali, a curious and sarcastic high schooler who ditches band camp to go on a cross-country road trip. But this isn’t a joyride! Ali is on an all-important mission to save her family video store from the nasty loan sharks trying to shut their shop down. Swindle strangers, pickpocket people, and con commoners across a wacky America of the ‘90s. And – it should go without saying – lie to your mom about all of it. Choose who deserves to be conned and who might need a helping hand. The world is your oyster (and hey, pearls are worth a lot!). One Con Doesn’t Fool All Con people your way! Wear disguises, sneak around, eavesdrop on conversations, and learn how to approach each mark. Maybe you think you can make enough cheddar just by pickpocketing. Or seek out more complex grifts that involve breaking and entering, smooth talking, and more. It’s up to you to outsmart everyone and lockpick everything that stands between you and saving your mom's video store. A Coming-of-Age Comedy If there’s one surefire way to discover yourself, it’s by setting out on an adventure. Luckily for you, you’ve got the aid of an expert grifter to coach you in the elusive art of charm. But a life of crime is no laughing matter! Not unless you turn on the laugh track and make it a criminally funny sitcom. Get ready to talk your way into deals, hearts, and trouble. And don’t forget to call home every once in a while to check in with your mom. Sure, you might argue with her sometimes (most of the time?), but you’re a teenager - that’s kind of your job! The Weird and Wack 1990s the Way You Remember Them Whether you were a ‘90s kid or not, this game is brimming with nostalgia. It offers you the perfect opportunity to relive your own awkward high school years, or if you sadly missed out on the ‘90s, finally experience all of the classic teen movies that feel so old and outdated. Plaid, payphones, VHS tapes, and malls – THE BIG CON has got all of the outrageous fads you remember (and some you want to forget) from the 1990s. But most importantly – you can ride the Hormipillar as much as you want!","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0220/fcbdf38ce909b7b5335ee4af1f6652bccda24e607d49872d.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4630-PPSA15392_00-0039174128756650","30%","0","Adventure","134.7","null","null","The Big Con - GRIFT OF THE YEAR EDITION","TRD","MIGHTY YELL STUDIOS INC.","2023-08-31","the-big-con-grift-of-the-year-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","449.00","0","314.30","1","",

Tackle challenging encounters with your party of two characters, using a variety of skills and highly interactive environments. Maybe you'll light an enemy on fire and kick them into a grain field for a proper barbeque, or set up a trap and fell a tree on top of them. The options are endless, and you're the one in charge! You have control over time The core of Iron Danger is its unique time control mechanic. You can rewind time up to 5 seconds whenever you want, trying different strategies and combinations of moves until you find the right one for the task at hand. The time manipulation allows us to combine real-time combat gameplay with controls from more traditional, tactical turn-based combat games. This gives tactical combat a puzzle-like element, as you can keep trying new approaches to turn impossible odds to your advantage and synchronize the actions of your characters for the perfect outcome. You will die, but you will not fail! Iron Danger is set in a world of lofty fells, primeval forest, and placid lakes...as well as living gods and monsters of steel. The city of Kalevala, home of the humans who rebelled against the gods and forsook their protection, shines in the middle of this world, surrounded by towns, sea lanes and woodlands under its protection. But from the frozen north, a witch queen is leading her army on a quest for vengeance against the lords of Kalevala. Ancient ruins from the days when gods dwelled on the earth are opening to unleash forgotten powers, tempting humans and striving to overtake the world. You’ll take on the role of Kipuna, a sharp-witted village girl, who becomes imbued with an ancient power that grants dominion over time and death. You must use your wits to control it as you’re drawn into a war between the city of Kalevala and the armies of the Northlanders driven by their witch queen Lowhee. Your task is to master the power, in order to use it for mankind’s protection, while your enemies seek to harness it in the service of total destruction.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2114/58030e86a07917a7b43b63059fa93780a7b7c79e428eb767.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8923-PPSA12357_00-IRONDANGEREU0000","90%","0","Strategy, Role Playing Games","69.9","null","null","Iron Danger","TRD","Daedalic Entertainment GmbH","2023-08-16","iron-danger-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","0","69.90","0","",

"","2024-10-23","American Hero is the never-released outrageous and unforgettable FMV game that lets you play as the star in an over-the-top 1990s Hollywood action movie. Get a babysitter for the kids, this game is a madcap, mile-a-minute spree of spies, dives, and gun-toting bad guys that will have you on the edge of your seat. You take on the role of Jack, a handsome, jaded former intelligence officer pulled out of his retired life as a strip club regular for one last mission to stop the villainous virologist Krueger, who plans to unleash a mind-controlling virus on the unsuspecting citizens of L.A. Everyone is out to kill Jack now that he’s hot on Krueger’s trail, and he’ll need to use his mind, muscles, and mojo to stay alive long enough to stop Kruger’s plot. Your spur-of-the-moment decisions will help or hinder Jack as he tries to find and protect the only scientist who has the cure to counter Krueger’s deadly bioweapon. A restoration and remaster of a game lost to time for over 25 years, American Hero was originally designed for the Atari Jaguar CD as a “playable movie” with a groundbreaking, more fluid presentation than the FMV games of its time. The game features the talents of professional actors, including Timothy Bottoms (The Last Picture Show, Johnny Got His Gun), Daniel Roebuck (The Fugitive, Final Destination), and Musetta Vander (O Brother, Where Art Thou, Wild Wild West). For this restoration, Timothy Bottoms reprises his role in newly recorded voiceovers of Jack’s inner thoughts heard throughout the game. This restoration was rebuilt from the ground up with new game logic that delivers on the ambitious promise of the original game. This edition of the game includes new voicework from star Timothy Bottoms to accompany the original footage, completing the American Hero experience for the first time. American Hero features: • An explosive and adult-oriented Hollywood production with intense action, spicy encounters, and gut-busting laughs • A winding player-directed plot with multiple paths and endings • A unique FMV format that plays smoothly like watching a film • The return of Hollywood actor Timothy Bottoms as Jack with newly recorded voiceover","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/2203/ejzKp9VIndGcgNyCzJyu60bv.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6260-PPSA09302_00-9439955969514772","35%","0","Action, Unique","341.25","null","null","American Hero","TRD","Ziggurat Interactive, Inc.","2023-07-04","american-hero-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","341.25","1","",

"","2024-10-23","The Last Hero of Nostalgaia is a satirical action-adventure, driven by a dark story, set in an incredibly rich and complex world. Nostalgaia, the world of videogames, is collapsing backwards into a mysterious pixelation, with every particle of fidelity bleeding away. Oblivion seemingly awaits even our most cherished gaming memories. But as the lighting dims and frames diminish, with the world on the brink of extinction, hope emerges to fight back. As the most hideous pixelated hero to ever spawn in Nostalgaia, you must fight through an army of its mindless inhabitants, while being jeered by a cynical narrator who despises your very existence. Featuring hard but fair combat that fans of the genre will relish, along with full character customization, unique battle armor and engaging narrative mechanics rich in lore, The Last Hero of Nostalgaia’s twisted and wicked tale is prepared to send you headfirst into almost certain death around its every vertex. - Set in a world celebrating video game nostalgia, The Last Hero of Nostalgaia features hard but fair souls-like exploration and combat, combined with a twisted, wicked tale told by a cynical narrator - Play together through online co-op and brave the pixelization together! - Uncover various suits of armor and weapons, each with their own unique lore and attributes","2024-10-08","/game/112181","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0110/1021977336a32ff275a9499add1f576e71d96ccd639fa6d4.png?w=200","11","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8936-PPSA10582_00-4505501028475996","65%","24","Action","262.5","null","null","The Last Hero of Nostalgaia","TRD","COATSINK SOFTWARE LTD","2023-06-20","the-last-hero-of-nostalgaia-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","16","306.25","1","",
"","2024-10-23","Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like, but with persistent upgrades, and persistent heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your inheritance, grow the family manor, and give your children a better fighting chance. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. One daughter could be vampiric Ranger, while another could be a vegan Chef. It’s a new experience every time. RL2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges. WHAT’S NEW IN 2 Every Adventure is Unique New monsters, traps, and layouts await you every time you enter the Kingdom. This is a world where improvisation, not memorization, is the key to success. Wildly New Classes No two classes play the same. Hide atop Ivy Canopies as the Ranger and rain poisoned arrows down on your foes. Take to the skies as a Dragon Lancer, striking enemies at massive speeds. Or sing and dance through danger as the joyous Bard. RL2 supports 15 new classes, with 15 distinct styles of play. Brand New Style Rogue Legacy 2 features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops. The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar Rogue Legacy look and feel. Revamped Biome Generation Biome generation in RL2 will feel completely new, as each biome adopts different “build strategies” to create completely unique randomly-generated regions. True Metroidvania To really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities and fundamentally change the way you play. Prove your worth, provided you can uncover the many heirlooms. Traits 2.0 Though fun the first time, traits in RL1 often wore their welcome later in the game. We’ve now added gold modifiers to entice players to take on new challenges. The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward. This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time. Relics and Resolve One of the most exciting new features to Rogue Legacy 2 is the ability to pick up Relics, which are unique items that change how your run is played. Gain stat modifiers, complete special challenges, and even gain brand new abilities as you traverse the kingdom. But be careful, the more Relics you obtain the more your resolve is shaken, and all Relics are lost if your hero perishes. Improved Accessibility Rogue Legacy 2 takes accessibility to the next level with the introduction of House Rules. Toggle contact damage, tweak global damage and health, and even give yourself flight for difficult platform sections. You have complete control over how you want to play the game. Also introduced are new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed. Rich Narrative & New Game+ Beating the game once is only the beginning. Learn about the inevitable collapse of a once-thriving kingdom, and discover the dark secrets of the ones responsible, while you connect and build relationships with the characters you meet along the way. The new and expanded lore to RL2 runs deep as you continue to explore and discover multiple playthroughs in NG+. Choose how the game gets harder, from unique biome hazards, to special boss fights. The experience keeps changing for near infinite replayability. More of Everything The sequel adds more of everything people loved from the original Rogue Legacy. More traits, spells, classes, biomes, enemies, equipment, rooms, story. More secrets... Just more everything.","2024-10-08","/game/80560","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2315/370f9bc417f347c5e73fbdda450758ea4b04022d234b0e28.png?w=200","26","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4488-PPSA15506_00-0843633431123623","45%","119","Action, Adventure, Role Playing Games","0","null","null","Rogue Legacy 2","TRD","Cellar Door Games","2023-06-20","rogue-legacy-2-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","44","481.25","1","",

Additional characters can be purchased separately, so please be wary of purchasing the same character multiple times. A legendary arcade game developed by Dimps in 2005. This fighting game gained popularity for its smooth visuals powered by S.M.A as well as the high level of strategy driven by its 2-gauges system. And with the addition of new current-gen features it's even easier to play. - Battle Mechanics Polished to a Shine by a Legendary Studio Known for Fighters: The first original fighting game from Dimps, known for being involved in a number of other fighting games. It has continued to attract fighting game fans since its release in 2005 with mechanics that use 2 gauges--one for offense and one for defense--and slick 2D visuals powered by S.M.A. (Smooth Model Animation). - New Features for Console Provide a Modern Gameplay Experience: The console version contains new features such as an Online Versus Mode--a first for the series. It uses Rollback Netcode, which corrects lag between players, making for a streamlined experience online. And with 16:9 wide-screen support, AI and a training mode, you can fully enjoy this game in the comfort of your own home. - Main Game Modes: ・Arcade ・Survival ・Time Attack ・Local Multiplay ・Online Multiplay with rollback netcode ・Training ・Gallery Added features: Spectator mode, rematch, match recording, combat range and match time settings, assist mode, new character colors, button assignment for Boost Dive, and an updated training mode including character-specific gauge and enemy attack/dodge/ground recovery settings, as well as adjustments to enemy auto recovery timing. - The Story: It is the end of the 20th century... A large-scale natural disaster struck the eastern area of a nation. It wiped out the financial sector and resulted in a staggering loss of life. At the dawn of the 21st century, the conglomerate PROBE-NEXUS, commonly known as Probe, began reconstruction efforts in that eastern area. Colossal capital and cutting-edge technology was poured into rebuilding it. Skyscrapers that put the old high-rises to shame along with the world's biggest shopping mall and recreational facilities. This was the dazzling birth of a symbol for the new century. It was christened Zone Prime. And now, in an undeveloped sector of its western block, there was an area known as the slums... - Additional Characters: ・Greed A survivor of the illegal fighting organization ""Valor"". He joined the tournament ""F.F.S."" again in order to fight against a yet-to-be-seen strong fighter. ・Hazama A new president of the PROBE-NEXUS, ostensibly to support the new chairman, Beatrice. But behind the scenes, he is working in the dark to extend his own power. ・Beatrice A granddaughter of Mr. Brad. And after his retirement, she succeeded him as Chairman of PROBE-NEXUS.

"","2024-10-23","The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ is an official adaptation based on the literary works of J.R.R. Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose… How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring ™, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself… or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn't break; he bends, he adapts… Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It's up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","2024-10-08","/game/82092","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0314/3bfea22d60d10ee2ba3ab64ffbfe95a53ee9a133d0fcc77e.png?w=200","13","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG0000000000000","85%","18","Adventure","999999","null","null","The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™","TRD","NACON SA","2023-05-25","the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","15","314.85","1","",

The Two Point Studios Double Pack features both critically acclaimed games - Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. Also includes Two Point Hospital's first four major DLCs, Bigfoot, Pebberley Reef, Close Encounters and Off the Grid, along with two item packs, Exhibition Items and Retro Items. Two Point Hospital Build, cure and improve! Build up a hospital from nothing to a masterpiece as you design the most beautiful – or functional – healthcare operation in the whole of Two Point County. Optimise your hospital design to increase patient (and cash) flow, arranging corridors, rooms and waiting areas to your exact specifications. Expand your hospital to multiple buildings as you look to get as many patients through the door as possible. Place decorative and functional items around your hospital to improve its prestige, lower patient boredom, increase happiness and keep those end of year awards flowing in. Cure unusual illnesses! Don’t expect Two Point County to be populated with your usual types of patients. In this world, you’ll experience all kinds of unusual illnesses; from Light-headedness to Cubism – each requiring their very own special type of treatment machine. Diagnose illnesses, build the right rooms to handle them, hire the right staff, and then get ready, because curing just one of these illnesses is just the beginning. Once you’ve conquered an illness, research improved cures and machines and turn your hospital into an unstoppable healthcare juggernaut. Your first hospital is where it begins, but what next? Two Point Campus Build your university, your way! It’s time to spin academia on its head! Got a yearning for learning? Or just keen to build an educational masterpiece? Two Point Campus is jam-packed with new creative tools to help you build the university of your dreams. For the first time, build on the outside as you develop a blank canvas of greenery into your own delightfully educational campus environment, housing the top teaching facilities in the land. Lay down pathways with new easy-to-use tools. Plant glorious collections of outdoor flora. The only limit is your imagination (and your in-game bank balance). Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies. Build libraries, hire the best staff, kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked! But it’s not just work hard. Oh, no. It’s play hard, too. You’ll need to keep an eye on their happiness and make sure they’re getting enough entertainment, pastoral care and general joie de vivre to develop into incredible individuals who will do the legacy of your university proud.

It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.

The voices they hear will help them identify potential suspects and solve the mysteries. What is it that’s connecting seemingly unrelated cases? This edition also contains ""The Lethal Script"" case that will have the detectives investigating a movie industry mystery on The Peak Hotel. Put on your headphones and step back into the past. Use the voices you hear to return to crime scenes, tracking down each individual involved and solving the cases. But where do the voices come from? Can you trust what you hear? And what's the mysterious thread weaving all of these cases together? A Unique Case-Solving Experience Discover the truth hidden in the voices from the past. Step through time as you use our device to eavesdrop on conversations from past crime scenes. Every clue, every move, and every motive will be presented in the form of audio.

Firstly because the whole story was written during a live-stream, which makes the story totally nonsensical! If this doesn't convince you remember that not only do I have a gun, I also know all your secrets. This is of course a joke, I do not know your secrets, yet. The game even features some of the most famous actors to have ever lived, including ""Thrash94Gaming"" you might know him for never being in a movie. ""LaraCroft86"" you might know her for also not being in any movie. Lastly but mostly least ""Gamer Jeffro"" for his famous role as Asa Gray in the video game that you are about to buy. Thankfully this game also includes two actors from Kimulator's Films, sadly they also were never in anything noteworthy.

Don't challenge me or I will sheesh your whole family, including your dog, it's not a threat, it's a fact. Now back to the game, it features over 2 hours of video footage of me and my worst enemy Swag-Girl, who even says Swag in 2023? Pft, we all know Sheeshing is the new hip and cool thing to do. This game is an interactive movie telling the story of how I went on earth and became a super-hero or whatever, it's pretty sick if you ask me! Not sick in the sense that you will throw up, but in the sense that it's cool. This my friend was a word play, you can expect this level of humour in the game, may I say it even gets better than this, not a lot, but at least a little bit. The game as a ton of bonus content too!

Defend your city as five unique and devastating Kaiju grow in power with every attack. Unfortunately, they can't be killed, but can be slowed down and forced to fall back... for now. Monsters move towards the nearest building, and the scientists have mathed the exact odds of where they might go next. Build sacrificial army bases and airfields to distract the Kaiju. If standard methods aren't enough, deploy experimental weapons such as freeze rays and transforming mechas to keep them at bay. Or you can always park tanks and jets in the monsters’ path to slow them down (don't worry, we have a good insurance policy). If all your efforts fail, don't be ashamed and run away! Be prepared to evacuate the laboratory using transport trucks, boats, or planes when the Kaiju get too close. Play missions from all over the world as you progress through the fight against Kaiju in a 15+ hour story-based campaign.

Fans will also be greeted by a new difficulty mode that includes new events upon completion of the base game. - Completely reimagined graphics that make for a beautifully terrifying experience. - Brand new unlockable difficulty mode with new events and dialogue. - Violence and gore that are not recommended for the squeamish.

You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. ""IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN"" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels…) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones for your style and shred the most iconic spots!","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/0610/9c75daf101112bea773a57692d2d8e01bd2855d53ab81f5a.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06510_00-1798662863472577","75%","0","Simulation, Sport","524.75","null","null","Session: Skate Sim - Deluxe Edition","TRD","NACON SA","2022-09-22","session-skate-sim-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","524.75","1","",

As time passes for everyone on board, explore the interwoven lives of the patients and staff; discover something new on each and every playthrough. Welcome to the Hospital It's the summer of 1978, and Casey Beaumaris is trying to make the most of her holidays, when her mum asks her to spend a long weekend helping out at the airborne hospital where she works. Casey prefers the company of books to people, but she agrees, secretly planning to write an article about her visit for the school newspaper. With her trusty notebook at the ready, Casey arrives on board the airship. The staff are overworked as they prepare for the visit of an important official, while the patients react to grief, or deal with active trauma. In the midst of these and many other interlocking and overlapping stories, Casey spends time with the patients, learning about their lives, and, as the stories unfold, discovering what she can do to help. Explore A Living World Within the world of Wayward Strand, time passes for everyone - characters continue their lives without waiting for you to interact with them. In Wayward Strand’s unique narrative structure, the stories of over a dozen characters constantly unfold around you in real time, as you, as Casey, roam freely throughout each day. Choose which story to be a part of by following people, having conversations, and exploring the hospital. The hospital’s residents are an eclectic cast of characters – some charming, some eccentric, some rude – each with their own desires, goals and imaginations. Every character moves and acts of their own accord, at their own pace, on their own timeline - sharing news with each other, arguing, joking, gossiping - or having a chat with Casey when she comes by. Every playthrough gives you the opportunity to discover something you didn’t see previously - what you missed the first time, you might see the second, third, or fifth time around. Your Journey When you see someone, you can follow them, to see where they go and what they get up to. You can eavesdrop on peoples’ conversations, or come into the room and be a part of the discussion. Spending time with particular characters will lead you to new storylines, locations, revelations and resolutions. As the journalist for her school newspaper, Casey keeps track of events and information in her notebook. Players use Casey’s notebook to delve deeper into peoples’ stories, to make new discoveries, and to piece together mysteries.

Your mission is to help the inhabitants of Rayland to transport the energy of the Domus through the various lands contained in the path. For this, you must correctly position the Reflectus and rotate them so the energy rays reach the necessary Domus. Rayland features a variety of brain teasers about reflecting a beam of light around an isometric playfield from one point to another. The emitter and receiver are stationary, and it’s your task to reposition mirror-like reflector panels to direct the course of the beam. Gameplay is simple, but the challenge is increasingly high. Do you have what it takes to clear them all? Features: • Use the resources of each level to make reflected rays reach their target! • Intersect rays to generate a new vector for them. • Move and rotate the mirror-like Reflectus! • Aim through gaps between blocks to allow the beam to pass through! • Overcome a variety of brain-teasing stages!

"","2024-10-23","Survive, gather resources, expand your crew, improve your starship, and pave the way through outer space – full of hostile races. Your path will consist of difficult choices and everyone will have an influence on the outcome. …and perhaps you might be able to solve the mystery of this universe. FLYING AMONG THE STARS You are the commander of the “Melistar” (“The Star Bee”), and you have a swarm of intelligent anthropomorphic bees. Your ship is your home, and your mission is to keep an eye on its fighting ability to repel enemy attacks; to stay on course, and to effectively collect resources to ensure that both the Queen and soldier bees have enough food; and, of course, to keep an eye on the status of your crew, whose members strive to get into trouble or arrange it. OTHER SPECIES The ship travels through an amazing universe full of strange insectoid races. Who you’ll be forming an alliance with, and who you’ll be fighting with, is largely up to you! The Merchant Guild fights the League of Smugglers; the intelligent Ants compete with Locusts for space colonies; the sinister cult of Blood Suckers spreads across the galaxy... We’ll have to fight and trade – and every one of these decisions can be a turning point in the story. SURVIVAL AND STORYTELLING * You can try your hand at surviving. Space cycles alternate, resources run out – and the crew increases; but luck and accurate calculation are on your side! Competently upgrade your ship and set the right course – and you can stay alive for a certain amount of time, or maybe even break a record! * If you like branching plots and world exploration – boldly immerse yourself in the storyline. The CyberHive universe is a mysterious and deep setting. Collect ancient artifacts and pieces of knowledge on distant planets about the past – and discover how the world turned out to be and what misfortune it faces. Maybe you can avert it... or not. MANY EVENTS As you try to find resources and survive, you will experience many events on the ship: from intrigues within the crew and problems with passengers, to a large contraband “set-up” or a collision with the ghost of a legendary pirate starship. Some events form a story, and some occur randomly.

France, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken.

Don’t think death can save you – every time you die, you'll awake trapped in this nexus. Outbreak: Endless Nightmares focuses on extreme replayability by offering multiple character options – each with their own abilities, upgrade paths and more! Each time you venture into the anomaly, it’ll change and become increasingly difficult as you grow in power. You'll need to think carefully about what weapons, healing items, and other supplies you'll bring along.

"","2024-10-23","Starlight Shores is an island-themed visual novel that adopts a unique ""short story"" romance style. It features multiple endings where your choices truly matter. The Story: After your childhood friend Theo wins a weekend getaway to the town of Seaside, you prepare to spend your birthday in paradise. It's been months since you last saw Theo, and she's incredibly excited to spend the weekend together. She invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just the get-together that you need to reconnect. Everything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he's bringing along an uninvited guest. Although Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's about the only thing you share in common... Will you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star? The Cast: Theo is your childhood friend. Although initially shy with strangers, Theo has a great sense of humour and loves to joke around with her friends. She prefers to have a tight-knit group and doesn't open up to just anyone. She studies photography at the same college as her roommate Lena and loves spending time with her. Theo won a draw for a cottage getaway in the town of Seaside and is your host for the weekend. Lena is Theo's roommate... and replacement best friend. You don't know much about her, or even what she's studying. From what you've seen on Friendex, Lena is a vibrant and outgoing person. She's always dyeing her hair different colours and wearing cute clothes. According to her online bio, in her spare time she enjoys hiking and playing piano. Alec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both have similar hobbies like gaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally, renting a student house with Alec seemed like a great idea... until he started dating. He jumps from girl to girl, never committing despite constantly whining that he wants a serious relationship. His latest date, Erika, tagged along to the cottage without an invitation. Lately, Alec has been annoying you... more than usual. A year younger than you, Erika is from the same hometown. You don't remember much about her, or ever talking to her...","2024-10-08","/game/79419","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/0306/M9xVmLdfrt5HiWCDb62MsKWE.png?w=200","1","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7099-PPSA04331_00-PPGSHORESXXXXXXX","40%","0","Adventure, Adventure","251.4","null","null","Starlight Shores","TRD","Penguin Pop Games LLC","2022-01-25","starlight-shores-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","419.00","0","251.40","1","",

"","2024-10-23","In this game you abstractly follow the narration of a young man who slowly but surely becomes insane. This leads you straight into the middle of an exciting murder case and a murder mystery unfolds while you listen to the testimonies of witness, friends and relatives. The whole game is somewhat Christmas flavored - however, don't get yourself comfortable, the game not going to give you a nice and warm feeling but rather confront you with a cold and harsh reality as the thrilling storytelling of the game will leave you with a cold shiver down your spine. The game is a must have for any true fan of thrillers and anyone how enjoys a murder mystery that goes beyond the normal story telling. How does the gameplay work? You will play as a free-floating ghost like creature. Basically, as the soul of someone who is experiencing the story. You are very small in comparison to the surroundings and can fly freely through the area. You start by exploring the area and enjoying the feeling of flying as well as the gentle yet mysterious background music. Soon after starting to explore, you will find the first memory piece. You can collect the memory pieces to continue with the story and to advance with the overall narration. The story talks about a young boy, about his live and about how everything changes.

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/oiWObCmIi2HWJ2AUnHfc7P7a.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCODELUXE000000","85%","0","Action, Adventure","314.85","null","null","Sherlock Holmes Chapter One Deluxe Edition","TRD","FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","2021-11-15","sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","314.85","1","",

"","2024-10-23","Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again is a dynamic platformer with the elements of a rogue-lite, a combo system and special moves. The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won’t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King’s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter’s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King’s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose. • The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty. As you progress, you'll come across Easter eggs, things that’ll crack you up and allusions to other games coupled with self-mockery • Randomly generated locations of items, artifacts, traps, rooms in the building, enemies and bosses • 12 characters, all with different performance and equipment • Customized equipment which can be upgraded with rocks, runes and enchantments • Secret features and tricks (e.g. get a firesword by plunging your sword into the lava) • Jaw-dropping action with various moves, skills and spells!","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/1314/p9Xoj3zDWsHsxVd3qyJsR5SE.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5506-CUSA29830_00-PLPA000000000000","69%","0","Role Playing Games, Action","25.12","null","null","Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again","TRD","BIG WAY LLC","2021-10-26","princesslootpixelagain-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","157.00","0","48.67","1","",

You'll have to repel assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and do more on your way to the deepest parts of the complex. Work with item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and return fire.

"","2024-10-23","Evertried is an isometric, tactical rogue-lite set in the afterlife where the player ascends a mysterious tower by defeating enemies in turn-based combat. Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny. In Evertried, the player’s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don’t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might.

"","2024-10-23","You play the role of captain Ashley S. Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls ""Mr. Riggs"", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You’re the only human there, after all. SURVIVAL Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game – including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™’s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.","2024-10-08","/game/80159","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0114/xvUwYjctSRFXETMYPdfkwDUc.png?w=200","23","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4380-PPSA03754_00-3110489674172889","45%","48","Action, Strategy","472.05","null","null","The Riftbreaker","TRD","Exor Studios","2021-10-13","the-riftbreaker-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","34","576.95","0","",

In Train Station Renovation you play as a renovation company specialised in restoring railway stations. The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into 15 maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage. Quick and easy access to equipment is the key to success. There are many tools and options for repairing and decorating the station. Work with basic items such as paint rollers, spray cans, crowbars and repair wrenches or use your in-game tablet to order new materials and items. Some stations will even allow you to repair and renovate the old trains. This means you will be able to take care of the technical condition of those vehicles yourself. Specializations development tree An aesthetic development character tree t is available. You will speed up your work time at individual stages and elements of the game by upgrading your skills.

You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/1810/28taywFGufUZvkXKXWEqoHeG.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5987-CUSA28973_00-6111579429226868","80%","0","Simulator","78.75","null","null","Train Station Renovation","TRD","ULTIMATE GAMES","2021-10-01","train-station-renovation-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","0","105.00","1","",

"0","2024-10-23","RPG with roguelike elements set in a dark fantasy world, where your choices determine how challenging the fights and enemies will be. Sin Slayers: Enhanced Edition is an expanded version of Sin Slayers that includes all of the previously released expansions that include new locations, enemies, heroes, items, new storyline and many additional quests. Create, equip and lead a team of heroes. Each unit will have its own abilities and weaknesses, so plan your combat strategy accordingly. You’ll journey through stinking primeval forests, boneyards riddled with crypts and the graves of fallen warriors, and other places even the bravest adventurer would fear to tread. Battles, traps, and bizarre enemies... Everything and everyone wishes to take your life, but don't succumb to despair. Between fights your party can take their rest at a fountain, or while on the road in an old church which leaves its doors open to the weary and wounded. Travel every path and byway of the Valley, obtain new weapons on the field of battle or by fulfilling quests, gather ingredients for magical elixirs and resources to craft armor and amulets. If a certain item is beyond your crafting ability, ask the blacksmith in the Old Church for help. The best gear will allow you to challenge the deadliest monsters. The souls of many heroes were cursed upon death, leaving them to wander a dark and uncharted world, an afterlife reserved for sinners. Is this the end, or..? Gather your team. Equip them with weapons, armor, and amulets. Level up your abilities as you move forward. The Sin Lords must be slain. Sin Slayers features a classic turn-based combat system in the tradition of the best JRPGs, giving you free rein to pit your tactical skills against the wretched inhabitants of the Valley of Fallen Sinners. Steel yourself. Enemies are everywhere and you will need to make difficult decisions and face dire peril to prevail. Depending on your choices, the sinfulness of your team will go up or down. If it's high — expect tougher enemies. Whatever might be buried there, is it wise to desecrate those graves? Every decision you make matters, and on the road to the next Sin Lord you will have many opportunities to choose poorly. Every crusade against a Sin Lord will be unique as every location is randomly generated. Think you know everything there is to know about a fetid swamp? We promise there are new lessons to learn, though they may not be to your liking! Legends tell of a place betwixt worlds, a region outside time and space called the Valley of Fallen Sinners. A dense, preternatural fog lays like stinking breath over black woods. What cursed hordes await? Vicious beasts, damned warriors, the undead, and worse chthonian horrors, all with an unslakable craving for new souls to perpetuate their own unnatural life. This region is for the most contemptible cowards, those who died because of their sins and the darkness weighing down their souls. At one time, they lived as brave heroes across a multitude of worlds, and bards composed ballads to their noble deeds. Until the day darkness flooded their hearts and killed them. Now regret consumes them, but their souls will find no rest. They are doomed to wander the Valley endlessly, searching for rest, respite, an end to their torture. But they will know no peace until someone destroys the seven seals of the Portal of the Worlds. Only then will the gates open and the damned finally escape their prison... Truth be told, no one has attempted this before.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/2410/05qiDsHGdwFR9NYctpc0t1mP.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6216-CUSA25429_00-7873955240527144","50%","0","Role Playing Games, Strategy, Role Playing Games","314.55","null","null","Sin Slayers","TRD","Artem Korovkin","2021-09-02","sin-slayers-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","349.50","1","",

"","2024-10-23","Order of Battle: World War II is a turn-based strategy game with an impressive variety of scenarios and theatres of war. Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders – split between Generals, Pilots and Captains – is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow. FEATURES Classic turn based, hex based gameplay with an intuitive UI and great depth. Play in dynamic campaigns with unit carryover and multiple ""what-if"" scenarios. A rich 3D world with detailed animations and effects 20 different Specializations give a unique feel to each faction including Banzai Charge, Bushido Code and even the Manhattan Project. Over a thousand different unit types, including infantry, tanks, ships and aircraft, each with unique visuals and animations Attach unique commanders to your units to give them additional offensive and defensive bonuses A deep but intuitive supply system allowing breakthroughs & encirclements.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1812/6vfDdBCOEsxM7cwPshdYlmYB.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4136-CUSA14680_00-OOBWWII000000001","51%","0","Strategy","342.51","null","null","Order of Battle: World War II","TRD","Slitherine","2021-08-19","order-of-battle-world-war-ii-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","342.51","1","",

"","2024-10-23","You find yourself in a room with no exits. Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive? If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode! Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play. You can: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without PlayStation(R)VR. When playing in VR you can use the DUALSHOCK, a pair of MOVE controllers or the AIM controller. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type. The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it. Get your name up there and challenge your friends!

Once signed, the Protocol must be promptly implemented. Have a nice day! Plot The action of Protocol, most likely, takes place in the near future. You are a flippant soldier who signs up for the Protocol program implementation. Packed in a landing box and dropped off somewhere in the Arctic Circle, not far from the Terminus research complex, your main objective is to follow a mysterious AI's orders, who uses you to make ""first contact"" within the Protocol program framework.

Countless heroes have tried and failed to destroy the ancient spell that holds the castle walls. Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside, guarding the sword shards — the last known thing to be capable of defeating the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure. Although you are not alone — some help could be obtained from the merchants, who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them to disappear... Plan your every step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option. There are two difficulty modes: PAL/NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch. Just like in old NES games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found… Features: - Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming. - Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock. - Randomly generated castle, 216 rooms to overcome. - Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/0516/PR3tOOkXXc9G7Zs8zewJEI9o.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5645-CUSA26567_00-00ZOLOTAYACHASHA","50%","0","Role-Playing","24.5","null","null","Castle of no Escape 2","TRD","Xitilon","2021-03-13","castle-of-no-escape-2-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","245.00","0","122.50","1","",

Bonkies is a jolly party game about cooperation, space construction and the joys of colonizing the solar system as a team of monkeys. You and your prime mates will be tasked with raising all sorts of quirky constructions on distant planets, by stacking blocks so they fit a given outline. To do so, you will have to team up with other space faring animals and master the use of your trusty apequipment - a banana-fuelled jetpack and a powerful robo-arm.

Who said space construction was going to be easy? Monkey around with your friends! Moving heavy blocks is no small feat. Fortunately, up to 4 friends can join forces together to carry this burden (or drop it on each other's heads). Monkey around by yourself Waiting for friends to join you? Don’t worry! You can have fun in the single player campaign! Fancy blocks for every occasion To make the job more interesting, you’ll find some rather unusual blocks at your disposal.

Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety. If you can survive long enough to find it.","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/2309/XEozUpmOCdLB940sqK9hCvS5.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3999-CUSA19091_00-NOWHEREPROPHETEU","80%","0","Strategy","153.8","null","null","Nowhere Prophet","TRD","NO MORE ROBOTS","2020-07-30","nowhere-prophet-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","769.00","0","153.80","1","",

But most importantly, it’s about understanding your cat. In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system. This game fits best for... - People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work - Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids - Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding - Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about ‘wasting their time’ (although we believe you shouldn’t feel guilty at all while playing games!) - Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun - Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it - People who like smart cats Learn how machine learning works in real life!

Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen. Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist! Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money.

Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do! Coding just got real! Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right?

"","2024-10-23","39 Days to Mars is a co-operative (and single-player) steampunk puzzle-adventure game. Step into the shoes of Sir Albert Wickes and The Right Honourable Clarence Baxter, two 19th century explorers who have chosen to pilot the HMS Fearful on its maiden voyage to Mars. When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park. It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece. For the solo voyager, the ship's computer-controlled cat will keep you company. Without a second pair of hands, Albert will need an extra dose of dexterity to navigate the challenges of Victorian space flight. The mix of action and thoughtful puzzles make 39 Days to Mars perfect for playing in short sessions. The entire adventure fits comfortably into an evening, or a long tea break. The HMS Fearful is ready to embark for Mars!","2024-10-08","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307UDm3VWrSgttBsIzD_ECJZ9CF25cFusQl5OBTrn5tjqAClsmDcdZvpohVwY4Cx80OopwS6glRZ2x1A2yDJBgYG0F1sil.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5495-CUSA15528_00-MARS000000000001","33%","0","Adventure, Puzzle, Action","421.43","null","null","39 Days to Mars","TRD","IT'S ANECDOTAL LIMITED","2019-10-28","39-days-to-mars-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","629.00","0","421.43","1","",

Up to 10 players can simultaneously fight in the Hexadiums, scenarios that are divided into 6 zones, each with its own gravity, different platforms, hideouts and open spaces, that turn them into a frenetic battlefield. In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle. This way, heroes will be an extension of each player’s style, creating an unique gameplay with hundreds of combinations.

"","2024-10-23","Welcome to Chasm, an action-adventure game in which you play a recruit undertaking your first mission for the Guildean Kingdom. Thrilled to prove your worth as a knight, you track strange rumors that a mine vital to the Kingdom has been shut down. But what you discover in the mining town is worse than you imagined: The townspeople have disappeared, kidnapped by supernatural creatures emerging from the depths. Honor-bound to solve the mystery and restore peace to the Kingdom, you embark upon an epic adventure, with deadly battles against cunning monsters, exploration of ancient catacombs and castles, and powerful new equipment hidden at every turn.
