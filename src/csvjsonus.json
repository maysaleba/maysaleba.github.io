        "description": "From PlayStation Studios and Bluepoint Games comes a remake of the PlayStation classic, Demon's Souls. Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who've faced its trials and tribulations before, can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance.<br /><br />In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One. <br />With the summoning of The Old One, a colorless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them, lost their minds – left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained.<br /><br />Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight, are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title “Slayer of Demons” and send The Old One back to its slumber.",

Enter a labyrinth that moves as you move, where mastering the elements is key to defeating enemies and uncovering the mysteries of this underground world. With a new experience awaiting every time you enter the dungeon, let the power bestowed by the crown guide you in this challenging adventure!<br /><br />Procedurally Generated Maze<br /><br />The procedurally-generated maze ensures you have a different experience every time you enter the dungeon.

Without access to the entire map, you have no choice but to strategically decide how you will mount an attack on the enemy.<br /><br />Synchronous Turn-Based Strategy<br /><br />The game moves as you move, and your enemies will stand still until you decide what's the best way to attack. Take however long you need to map out your route, decide the best way to avoid traps, or how to use the elements to your advantage. A carefully thought out strategy is the key to escaping this dungeon alive.<br /><br />Use the Environment<br /><br />As you go deeper into the dungeon you will come across terrains mirroring a variety of elements that can be combined with your skills to deal heavy damage to the enemy. Throw fire on top of oil to burn monsters and mix lightning with water to electrocute your foes. There are a lot of lethal combinations to explore and use to slay monsters you encounter.<br /><br />Learn Skills from your Enemy<br /><br />Throughout your quest, you will encounter elite monsters, equipped with elite skills, known as Familiars. By defeating them you will gain access to their abilities, increasing your arsenal of skills you can unleash as you continue on to the next levels.<br /><br />Game Features:<br /><br />- A totally new approach to strategy roguelike gameplay<br />- Synchronous turn-based combat, where each move is full of possibilities and each battle is a challenge<br />- Explore the atmospheric dungeons of different settings and try your best to survive until the end<br />- Experience randomly generated dungeons, weapons, relics, items, and challenges each time you start your journey<br />- Build your own unique combat style and choose from the variety of 40+ active skills, 60+ passive abilities, 30+ usable items, 170+ special relics<br />- Slay 100+ different monsters wielding nine unique types of weapons or up to 120+ individual weapons in total<br />- Dare to challenge more than 10+ powerful bosses<br />- Solve 60+ mysterious challenges and puzzles<br />- Reveal all the secrets and find the truth hidden behind the Nightmare Realm<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of.<br /><br />Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night.<br /><br />Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness. The game's cutscenes, quirky cast of characters, and the majestic Pacific Northwest vistas have been enhanced for an experience that delivers as much on its visual impact as its unnerving atmosphere.",

In Radio Commander situation reports are given to you in form of dramatic radio statements sent by troops fighting on the ground. And your only accessory is a strategic map, on which you can place tokens and notes.<br /><br />Radio Commander offers an unique experience very different from classic real time strategy games. It's a bold try to redefine the genre, as the player will be involved in a decision making process much more realistic than those pictured by casual RTS titles. Ask for situation reports. Listen what your men have to tell you. Send evac choppers and nape drops. Defeat the invisible enemy.<br /><br />Decide the fate of your soldiers. The choices you face will have a direct impact on the course of the game. They will also define views of your hero. Or maybe those are your views? Playing Radio Commander you must be prepared to answer tough questions about the righteousness of your actions, the price of a human life, and the toxic power of propaganda and stereotypes.<br /><br />Radio Commander includes:<br />- 9 main campaign missions (every mission is possible to complete in several different ways),<br />- 9 animated briefings,<br />- 15 unit types, including: infantry, evac choppers, gunships, field artillery, aerial reconnaissance, M113 armored personnel carriers, and napalm-carrying F4 Phantom jets (every unit is described by a unique set of statistics and communicates with commander using a different voice),<br />- full voice over,<br />- over 200 dialogue blocks, used to construct radio messages,<br />- over 600 story dialogues between units and the commander.",

You can disassemble tank exterior parts, from the bottom (wheels and tracks) up to the turret (gun, barrel, gun cradle etc.). Additionally, the interior of the tank is also available to be renovated, the crew space, tank engine and tank drive system.<br /><br />Take a seat inside the tank, as any of its crew. From here you can have better and easier access to the interior parts of the tank. Repair hatches, viewers, ammo holders, drive control components and gearbox parts.<br /><br />To start the tank, you need to repair its engine, gearbox and fuel system. Take the engine out and move it to a special engine stand, to be able to interact with it. Make sure the fuel, coolant and oil systems are assembled and the fluids are filled, so the tank engine can be put to test.<br /><br />High focus on details<br />Our tanks and vehicles are based on construction documents, expert opinions and insights from top II World War museums. Our goal is to give a fun and realistic simulation experience of building and repairing these legendary machines.<br /><br />Customize the tank as you wish, use different camouflages, paint colors, decals etc.<br />Find and extract tanks<br />One of the ways to obtain a tank is to get it during the extraction mission. After finding the spot where the tank is underground, call for the excavation team. Prepare the tank for extraction, by pumping the mud out of the tank and then cleaning the tank from whatever's left. Finally, order the lifting of the tank onto the truck trailer, to finish the mission, and move the tank into the workshop.<br /><br />Test your renovated tanks<br />Go on the training ground, check how your tank is dealing with special obstacles. Get inside the tank, start the engine and drive around to see if everything is working correctly.<br /><br />You can also take the tank to the proving grounds, where you are able to shoot the tank's armament on a special shooting range. You can use two different camera modes for better control of the tank.",

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock's quest for truth.<br /><br />As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.<br /><br />Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It's time to confront your past so you can become the legend you're destined to be.<br /><br />KEY PILLARS<br /><br />The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you'll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We've never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you're living it.<br /><br />Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace.<br /><br />And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there's something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean.<br /><br />A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really?<br /><br />A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult.<br /><br />Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It's up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you'll become.",

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity's last line of defense.<br /><br />Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF.

As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy.<br /><br />The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn't feel right and he plans his escape.<br /><br />“El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Using the shadows to his advantage is the core element of the game, as “El Hijo” will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that “El Hijo” must traverse to reach his ultimate goal.<br /><br />- Survive the Wild West through the cleverness of a young hero<br />- Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world<br />- Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless<br />- Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles<br />- Use an arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes<br />- Inspire other children to join you on the path to freedom<br />- Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Their analysts broke it down and determined it was of intelligent origin. Orochi management immediately concluded that the discovery was too sensitive for public knowledge and moved to keep it hidden. In secret, the corporation began construction of Trailblazer Alpha, a state-of-the-art Mars research outpost designed to identify the true nature of the message.<br /><br />You are Shane Newehart, an engineer stationed at Trailblazer Alpha and your security clearance means you are completely unaware of the existence of the mysterious signal. Your job is simply to keep the lights on until the transport ship Cyrano arrives bringing with it a new team to take over your duties.<br /><br />Soon you discover strange and unusual setbacks. Crucial systems are malfunctioning, the greenhouse is filled with a strange mist and the rest of your team has yet to return from their EVA mission. <br />Things are starting to fall apart.<br /><br />You begin seeing and hearing things that aren't there. Visions, hallucinations – or is that even what it is? Is this real… or are you slowly descending into madness?<br /><br />Experience true cosmic horror<br />With your only hope of rescue hundreds of thousands of miles away, you will be forced to explore the real-world fears of isolation and paranoia, enhanced with supernatural elements and cosmic horror. Terrifying visions and monstrous apparitions will make you question what is real and what is not as the very fabric of reality threatens to tear at the seams.<br /><br />Explore the darker side of Mars <br />Navigate a functioning Mars base in a game that uses non-fiction elements to immerse players in a believable setting. Overcome obstacles using computers, electrical systems, rovers, solar panels and more, then go beyond the outpost and explore the darker side of Mars.<br /><br />Moons of Madness draws upon the rich lore and mythology of Funcom's Secret World Legends.

Whilst the aim of the game is simply to escape, the detail is in the execution. (Don't say the word execution too loud in a prison). You may not be in an open prison, but you are in an open world where in between attending rollcalls, mealtimes and doing your chores you should grab every chance to plan your escape. Do you do favors for other inmates earning money and boosting their opinion of you along the way? Or workout and become stronger? Read to increase your skills or spend your time crafting items into homemade weapons and tools. What about working diligently in your prison job, to gain promotions to new jobs with better benefits? Keep a low profile or go out all guns blazing, as long as you escape in the end, that's all that matters.<br /><br />The Escapists developed by Mouldy Toof Studios & Team17 Digital  © 2015.

        "description": "DEATHLOOP is a PlayStation 5 game, not available on PlayStation 4. However, the “original game soundtrack selections” are playable on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.<br /><br />DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />Deluxe Edition Content: <br />• Unique Weapon: Transtar Trencher (PS5 Exclusive)<br />• Unique Weapon: Eat The Rich Tribunal<br />• Unique Weapon: .44 Karat Fourpounder<br />• Character Skin: \"Party Crasher\" Colt <br />• Character Skin: \"Sharp Shooter\" Julianna <br />• Two Trinkets (equippable buffs)<br />• Original Game Soundtrack Selections (*FORMATTED USB STORAGE DEVICE REQUIRED TO ACCESS AND PLAY SOUNDTRACK)<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane's unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you'll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you'll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You'll experience DEATHLOOP's main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you'll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you're feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna's stylish sneakers and invade another player's campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    <br />Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.",

An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers.<br /><br />Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these \"flying soldiers\" can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these \"characters\", they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance.<br /><br />Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.<br /><br />It's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.",

But as more victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, will the scales of justice tip in favor of defending the law or enacting vengeance?<br /><br />From the studio that brought you the Yakuza series, Lost Judgment weaves elements of investigative sleuthing, noir narrative and action combat into one mystery thriller. Take your detective expertise to the streets of Japan and defend those that the law fails to protect.<br /><br />INVESTIGATIVE ACTION  <br />Tap into Yagami's arsenal of private eye tricks to gather clues. From hi-tech gadgets including drones and social media listening devices to hardboiled gumshoe methods like scaling buildings and tracking suspects in the city. No stronger evidence than catching a suspect in the act.<br /><br />FREEFORM COMBAT  <br />Master Yagami's three unique, combo-heavy martial arts styles to overcome any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Further weaponize street fights with traffic cones, street signs, bicycles and beyond, plus customize each style with skill trees.<br /><br />DEEP UNDERCOVER<br />Go undercover at a local high school as a club advisor to get to the root of a mysterious rise in delinquency as it relates to the case. Join the Dance Club, where you'll be grooving to the rhythm; the Robotics Club, tasking your ingenuity to build the ultimate Yagami-bot; a boxing gym, to stick and move against fierce opponents; and a bike gang, where underground racing is the only way to earn respect.<br /><br />HIT THE STREETS  <br />As you comb the open cities of Kamurocho and Ijincho in pursuit of the case, take a break and get to know the unique culture of each through bars and other nightlife hotspots. It may be worth taking on a Side Case to lend your detective skills to residents in need – you never know who holds what cards.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Set in the era of portable 8-bit consoles, this game-within- a-game follows the adventures of Dot, an in-game character who sees her world torn apart by the Cyblin Lord, a villain able to break through the video game screen and invade the real world. In the game, the player inhabits Nicola, a second-grade student who must help Dot save both realities from this menace by facing challenges in the retrogaming 2D world, all while distracting the cranky teacher and escaping from the furious headmaster in her own 3D world.<br /><br />PlayStation Camera required",

        "description": "Pixel Ripped is back with a brand new nostalgia-fueled virtual reality game-within-a-game, this time in the year 1995! To restore balance to multiple dimensions, our videogame hero Dot recruits the help of the best gamer from 1995, an unassuming 9-year-old boy named David. Join this unlikely duo through challenging throwbacks to all your favorite classics from the late 16-bit and early 32-bit era of games inside a virtual reality world.<br /><br />The game evokes a genuine nostalgic feeling, such as the adrenaline of playing games without getting caught after your mom told you to go to bed, or the thrill of finding that brand new game at the store. You have to do all that and more through multiple environments - including your living room, bedroom, the local video rental store, the arcade at the pier, and more. With 6 fully original and highly differentiated levels, where each one feels like an entire new game, Pixel Ripped 1995 is an incredible journey for both VR and retro gamers.",

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock's quest for truth.<br /><br />As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another.<br /><br />Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It's time to confront your past so you can become the legend you're destined to be.<br /><br />KEY PILLARS<br /><br />The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you'll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We've never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you're living it.<br /><br />Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace.<br /><br />And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there's something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean.<br /><br />A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really?<br /><br />A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult.<br /><br />Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It's up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you'll become.",

The risk of being beaten up or even killed by the German military because we‘re opposing the regime. The risk of losing everything, including our loved ones. This is how we live. This is how we try to survive. Through the darkest of times.<br /><br />Plan, Act, Survive<br />You are the leader of a small resistance group in 1933's Berlin, of ordinary people, from Jews to Catholics and Communists to Patriots who simply can't stand aside. Your goal is to deal with small blows to the regime – dropping leaflets to spread awareness about what the Nazis are really up to among the people, painting messages on walls, sabotaging, gathering information and recruiting more followers. And all of that while staying undercover – if the regime's forces learn about your group, the life of each member is in grave danger.<br /><br />Experience history<br />Through the Darkest of Times is a historical resistance strategy game, focusing on conveying the somber mood of the period and the very real struggles of average people living in the 3rd Reich. Historical accuracy means that your small group of resistance fighters will not change the outcome of the war, nor will you prevent all of the Nazi's atrocities, but you can certainly do everything in your power to save as many lives as you can and oppose the fascist system wherever possible.<br /><br />Features:<br />• Experience the Darkest of Times in 4 chapters<br />• Fight for freedom, weaken the regime and lead your resistance group<br />• Plan activities, find collaborators and try not to get caught<br />• Feel the weight of responsibility as you make difficult decisions and face the dire consequences<br />• Beautifully illustrated expressionistic scenes and events",

Normal Mode allows you to enjoy the game in all its glory. In normal mode, all the features in the game are included. Realistic Mode requires more patience and efficiency from the player. Fish will be biting less and will fight longer. Some of the game features in this mode are disabled, such as the underwater camera.<br /><br />Every fisherman likes to admire his trophies. Some release their fish, other stuff and hang them on their walls. In Ultimate Fishing Simulator you can exactly do the same! Decide what you want to do with the fish you catch. Sell? Release? Stuff? The choice is yours.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

It is a celebration of ancient China's landscape, civilization and culture, infused with the mystique of its own legends in stark contrast to anachronistic technological designs. It is a world that is both familiar and mysterious, one of both science and spirituality, one that is waiting to be explored.<br /><br />Take the role of the calm and reliable swordsman Taishi Zhao as he fights to protect his family and uncover the truth of a blight threatens all of China. With a story deeply rooted in ancient Chinese history and mythology, Xuan Yuan Sword 7 reimagines both as one fantastical and chaotic realm under the governance of a new Xin Dynasty.<br /><br />Near the end of Western Han rule, the powerful prime minister of China superseded his Emperor, promising an era of peace and prosperity. But ten years later, that promise has never been fulfilled. Instead, a decade of war and famine has left China in ruin, and its salvation seems to lie in the hands of a Mohist swordsman who gains control of a fabled artifact called the Elysium Scroll. Can the science-seeking Mohists revive their former glory, or will they fade into the pages of forgotten history?<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Journey across ancient China as a cinematic adventure unfolds.<br />• Slash, block, dodge and riposte in combo-based real-time combat!<br />• Control the Elysium Scroll to slow down time, absorb monsters or alter the environment.<br />• Upgrade armor and weapons, develop passive skills and learn new techniques.<br />• Explore a standalone story requiring no prior knowledge of Xuan Yuan.<br />• Immerse yourself in the most advanced 3D visuals in series history!<br /><br />Offline play enabled",
