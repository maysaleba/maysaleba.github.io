Experience thrilling adventures in four totally different worlds: ● Explore a freaked out laboratory where Bismo and Plom had their accident! ● Uncover the secrets of the overgrown green forests... ● ... and survive the dry canyons where a deadly wind awaits you\u2026 ● ... just to prepare you for the bitingly cold caves!

Together you can solve puzzles and fight over precious coins. Coordination and communication are key to a successful journey. We recommend using gamepads for maximum enjoyability. The game also features a singleplayer mode with different level content.

To the people of Foundation, the underground facility is their entire world. Then, calamity strikes, changing the fate of five young girls. Their world is suddenly deserted. Quakes assail the underground halls, walls and ceilings collapse, and food and water begins to run out. Five girls, the final survivors, must find a way to pull through these dire conditions.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"8.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"109","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"539","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.14","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-02-12","LowestPrice":"2.49","SaleStarted":"2022-01-28","description":"Skelittle is a silly, colorful party game designed for fun with friends & family.

Eighties of the twentieth century. The golden age of 8-bit video games. We were leaving school, and we were going to spend our precious coins in the arcade machines. One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari's Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn't pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time. Meteoroids 3D doesn't want to be better than Asteroids; that's impossible. What we want is to make a tribute. And that's all we want. We have added some aspects, besides the famous UFO: a demon, and some enemy ships that launch rockets to destroy us. Main features are: Features.

But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King\u2019s blessing.
