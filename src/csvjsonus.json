Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.<br />CAMPAIGN<br />Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. Youâre the only human there, after all.<br />SURVIVAL<br />Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. <br />SANDBOX<br />If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game â including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions.<br />BASE BUILDING<br />Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission.<br />EXPLORATION<br />Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology.<br />CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY<br />The Riftbreakerâ¢âs gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.",

        "description": "Traverse Arcadia your way. Save your friends. Time is ticking.<br /><br />Alma is an Automaton that awakens to a world in ruin after the war with the humans. Anima, the resource that gives Automatons sentience, is running out and turning Alma's friends into mindless killing machines, the UNSIGHTED.<br /><br />Key Features: <br />EXPLORE YOUR WAY - The world of Arcadia is massive and ripe for exploration, with many shortcuts to discover and maps both above and below the surface of the world. When one path seems too tricky, find new uses for familiar weapons and tools.<br /><br />RICH AND VARIED COMBAT - Build your perfect loadout to suit your playstyle. UNSIGHTED allows players to equip weapons in various ways, from dual-wielding swords to shuriken and shotgun combinations. Alma will need to use perfectly timed combat actions to trigger faster reload speeds or a massively damaging parry to survive in the city.<br /><br />CRAFT AND UPGRADE - Upgrade Alma through an extensive upgrade tree via chips you'll find throughout your journey. Chips can be crafted or discovered, and each offers different bonus effects. Experiment with nearly limitless builds from the fast and efficient to the powerful and stylish.<br /><br />CHOICES MATTER - Alma's withering life force ticks away in real-time and is the driving factor in the story of UNSIGHTED. Tarry too long in one spot, and you may find that critical NPCs have already become Unsighted before you meet them.  Save or drain other Automatons of their anima for your survival. The constant passage of time can result in vastly different endings and allows for further playthroughs to stay fresh and exciting.<br /><br />HIGHLY REPLAYABLE + CO-OP - In addition to the main story UNSIGHTED also features additional challenge modes, BOSS RUSH and DUNGEON RAID. You can also bring a friend along your journey through Arcadia through full-featured CO-OP.<br /><br />Offline play enabled<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Whistle and stomp are the only moves you need to solve increasingly complex puzzles, as you manipulate strange critters' behaviour and go anywhere, anytime on a lush forest island.<br /><br />• A unique take on the Metroidvania formula: progress by exploring, observing and experimenting<br />• Find the Ancient Frogs and destroy the crystal at the heart of the island<br />• Whistle songs for special abilities, including rewind and fast travel<br />• Use the in-game camera and snap creature pictures to complete the Tokidex<br />• Push the game's mechanics to their limits to get 15 achievements and 100s of golden wings",

        "description": "while True: learn() is a puzzle/simulation game about even more puzzling stuff: machine learning, neural networks, big data and AI. But most importantly, it's about understanding your cat.<br /><br />In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it's you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system.<br /><br />This game fits best for...<br />- People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work<br />- Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids<br />- Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding<br />- Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about ‘wasting their time' (although we believe you shouldn't feel guilty at all while playing games!)<br />- Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun<br />- Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it<br />- People who like smart cats<br /><br />Learn how machine learning works in real life!<br /><br />The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don't worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required!<br /><br />Train yourself into a data science wizard!<br /><br />Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen.<br /><br />Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist!<br /><br />Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you'll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That's what real data scientists do!<br /><br />Coding just got real!<br /><br />Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it's your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right?<br /><br />Improve your gear, improve your life!<br /><br />Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you'll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it's not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe!<br /><br />Fun fact: this is what machine learning specialists actually do. Now, you can become one of them (minus the money)! while True: learn() is the best game about being a data science specialist because no one else has been weird enough to make another one!<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike.<br /><br />There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series.<br /><br />This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians.<br /><br />Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields.<br /><br />It's all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive – lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Just make sure you don't get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies!<br /><br />The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front), with a new game Isonzo coming soon with mountain warfare on the Italian Front! These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references.<br /><br />**Cross play supported between console platforms.**",

I'm VAL, your helpful and efficient Space Station AI!<br /><br />According to my records, this Station hasn't been used at all in the last 17 years! How very strange. Furthermore, it would appear that you are the only rational life form in this Sector. Well then, CONGRATULATIONS! I hereby officially pronounce you Commander of this Space Station! Hopefully you will enjoy more success than your predecessor who, according to the logbook, er… ran into some wormlike Aliens… Oh, nothing to worry about!<br /><br />To keep the same thing from happening to you, there's a lot you're going to have to do. Amongst others, there's the development of further Sectors, maintenance of the three vital Main Decks as well as the customer acquisition and entertainment of our extraterrestrial visitors, who provide us with sufficient Energy for our plans for global improvement. Oh, and before I forget – it's probably just a bug in my security protocols anyway – but my sensors are showing just loads of enemy creatures in all of the other Sectors…<br /><br />So, what are we waiting for? Let's get to work! Let us join forces to conquer space.\"<br /><br />SPACEBASE STARTOPIA captivates with its original mixture of economic simulation and empire building strategy paired with classic RTS skirmishes and a good dose of humor. In addition to the challenging single player Campaign and the versatile battle mode, there are also competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes for up to four players. And as if maintaining the three Space Station Decks, entertaining the eight Alien races and defending against enemy invaders were not enough of a challenge, the dynamic narrator AI is not going to mince matters and commentates the events in a lovely but sharp-tongued manner.<br /><br />- The 10-mission, fully dubbed single-player Campaign will require all your skills as Commander of the Spacebase Startopia as you strive to create one of the most attractive trade and tourism destinations in the known universe.  <br />- Each of the three Decks will require your leadership skills, with the Sub Deck containing all of the Rooms vital to survival, while the Fun Deck focuses on your visitors and the flora and fauna found on the Bio Deck provides sufficient Resources for survival as well as a home to the graceful Dryads.<br />- Prevail against your competitors, for you are not alone on the Space Station. Sabotage your opponents' economy or attack them with your Mech Units, conduct trade and beware of Space Pirates eager to board your Station.<br />- The dynamic narrator AI “VAL” reacts to your decisions and is always at your side in both word and deed – and the occasional extremely unqualified comment.<br />- In addition to the extensive single player Campaign, an individually configurable sandbox mode as well as both a competitive and a cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players awaits you.",

You will also get to fight giant bosses from time to time.<br /><br />But there's no rush to keep the game in full swing at all times. You may as well just relax, play the game on a slow pace, explore the sparkle void, consume nutritional elements, enjoy simple and surreal surrounding and listen to the ambient music soundtrack. The choice is all yours.",

        "description": "Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle.<br /><br />The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium.<br /><br />The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with.<br /><br />Battle your way across no man's land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn't for the faint hearted!<br /><br />Looking for more WW1 action? Check out Tannenberg for Eastern Front maneuver warfare, or the upcoming Isonzo for Italian mountain warfare!",

You play as “XIII”, a man without an identity, in a solo campaign with numerous twists and turns. Inspired by the eponymous graphic novel, the game features a completely reinvented and unique cel-shading design.

        "description": "When the aliens arrived, they didn't come in peace. The invasion was immediate and so overwhelming that humans didn't stand a chance. One thing it wasn't though, was quiet… A terrible rumble from upstairs woke Rex up from her slumber. For millennia she was hibernating in her Cozy Cave but the incessant crescendo of the alien invasion was too much to sleep through. It was time for Rex to go upstairs and give her new neighbors a piece of her mind!<br /><br />ROARR!'s fast and dynamic gameplay is a modern tribute to the good old brawler games we all enjoyed (or heard about from the older brother!) on classic platforms. With a load of terrifying bosses, twenty five types of enemies and six completely different Isles to explore, ROARR! is a brawler heaven (or hell!) for any gamer with appetite for destruction! Not to mention that it's a perfect game for any wild gaming party up to four players on the coach!",

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality.<br /><br />In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.<br /><br />Features:<br />• Survive the horror using adventure mechanics and exploration.<br />• Experience a beautiful, erotic hand-painted art style with Eastern and Western influences.<br />• Unlock additional outfits, some of which alter interactions throughout the game.<br />• Keep track of the immersive lore with a convenient journal feature.<br />• Discover multiple New Game+ modes, alternate endings and hidden extras!<br />• Get in the mood with a visceral cinema-length soundtrack.<br /><br />PS Vita: One time license fee entitles play on up to 3 PlayStation Vita systems activated by this account.",

A place that will give you a lot of fun!<br /><br />In Train Station Renovation you play as a renovation company specialised in restoring railway stations. The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into 15 maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life.<br /><br />Choose how hard you want to work.<br />The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage.<br /><br />Quick and easy access to equipment is the key to success.<br />There are many tools and options for repairing and decorating the station. Work with basic items such as paint rollers, spray cans, crowbars and repair wrenches or use your in-game tablet to order new materials and items. Some stations will even allow you to repair and renovate the old trains. This means you will be able to take care of the technical condition of those vehicles yourself.<br /><br />Specializations development tree<br />An aesthetic development character tree t is available. You will speed up your work time at individual stages and elements of the game by upgrading your skills. You will also get new equipment or unlock new options while renovating. If you happen to enjoy some renovation activities more than others, you will be able to upgrade them during your playthrough.<br /><br />Renovate and decorate train stations and trains.<br />Detailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements.<br /><br />The economy is very important<br />A complex economy aspect has been added to the game to increase realism. In addition to money needed to buy new items and repair materials, you can also benefit by segregating waste or completing additional tasks.<br /><br />Build your own station.<br />Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station.\"",

        "description": "DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane's unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you'll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you'll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You'll experience DEATHLOOP's main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you'll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you're feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna's stylish sneakers and invade another player's campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    <br />Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.",

        "description": "“Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today” tells the story of Michael, a man with no past, who must recover his identity and decode the two events that brought the world to the edge of collapse. The first one is the so-called “Great Wave,” an inexplicable chain of natural disasters. The second is a pandemic that has turned humans into “the Dissolved,” infected beings with special cognitive powers whose sick bodies will eventually dissolve into blood. If Michael doesn't hurry, he won't be able to avoid the impending moment of “dead synchronicity” when Time itself starts to dissolve.<br /><br />As players, you're going to find space-time distortions, concentration camps, supernatural phenomena, gruesome deaths, hard-to-solve puzzles and, all in all, a bloodstained challenge!<br /><br />Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow Comes Today ©2016 Fictiorama studios.

        "description": "\"El Hijo - A Wild West Tale\" is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a young boy on his quest to find his mother.<br /><br />As a six-year-old, “El Hijo” must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy.<br /><br />The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn't feel right and he plans his escape.<br /><br />“El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Using the shadows to his advantage is the core element of the game, as “El Hijo” will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that “El Hijo” must traverse to reach his ultimate goal.<br /><br />- Survive the Wild West through the cleverness of a young hero<br />- Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world<br />- Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless<br />- Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles<br />- Use an arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes<br />- Inspire other children to join you on the path to freedom<br />- Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Aliens took over the planet thousands of years ago, and the nameless protagonist was kept in a stasis chamber as a twisted relic to memorialize their victory. However, the mysterious Immortal Gate Keeper liberates her and sets her on a dangerous expedition to the Earth's core. Be warned though—the aliens will do whatever it takes to get their trophy back, and the Earth is filled with frightening creatures that hunger for human flesh.<br /><br />Shoot your way through the hauntingly beautiful remains of Earth.  Created by Roland Studios, a one-man indie development house, Daydreamer is a homage to 16-bit era side-scrolling shooters. Coupled with strategic platforming, high intensity battles, and pets that aid in combat, you wouldn't want to wake up from this dream.",

They say it takes seven hours to complete this game… Well let's see if you can do it! I trust you can though – my incredible charm and fascinating sense of style are more than enough to overcome any challenge!<br /><br />P.P.S. While you were reading this, someone just rang the doorbell of my castle and left a box with an “INDIE PRIZE - Best Game Narrative” tag on it. Well… just another acknowledgment of my incomparable awesomeness!",

Captain Thorn Brenin, the guard Lo Pheng and scribe Hopper Rouley don't yet know that the Reapers have returned and are planning to drown the world in blood so they can awaken the slumbering gods.<br /><br />The story can change at any time depending on your choices, sometimes leading to a character's death. This won't end the game, however, as the narrative continues without the hero but takes into account the consequences of his demise on future events. Don't rely on a single tactic or a powerful team to win the game – the AI in Ash of Gods adapts to your gaming style and forces you to be more cunning!<br /><br />The Ash of Gods graphics are completely hand-drawn with the use of live action video, creating realistic and detailed animations.",

        "description": "Epic Chef is a story-driven adventure game flavoured with life-sim farming, and crafting elements, blended together into one delicious dish via an interactive cooking experience - all served with a side of humour and elaborate cast of characters inspired by classics such as Mister Ajikko, or the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett. Grab your spatula and start on your journey to become... Epic Chef!<br /><br />Get ready to embark on a culinary quest unlike any other as you take on the role of Zest; from humble beginnings you will build a farm, grow delectable ingredients, craft machinery and cook your way to becoming the most Epic Chef in Ambrosia!<br /><br />COOKING MASTERCHEF<br />In Epic Chef you will combine ingredients, stirring and tossing with culinary precision to bring out the flavour elements of Vigor, Sophistication and Spirit in your dishes. This forms the core of the cooking experience that you must master in order to become the very best chef in Ambrosia.<br /><br />DELICIOUS DISHES<br />Dish synergy and ingredient properties combine with a dynamic recipe creation system, meaning that you can experiment with thousands of different combinations to create a unique menu of decadent delights. Serving Rats with Tomatoes and Potatoes? Don't you mean Tomato Souffle and Vermin Slices in Starchy Cream?!<br /><br />INTENSE CHEF BATTLES<br />Take on bitter rival chefs in epic culinary clashes to see who is crowned cooking king of Ambrosia! Dishes are scored on a variety of things from ingredients, to flavours, strength and more, with no two judges having the same taste. Become an even greater chef by utilising the addition of sauces to alter the properties of your dishes and influence the judges to win their favour.<br /><br />HOMEGROWN N' HOMEMADE<br />Live off your land by growing foods such as fruit and vegetables, gather resources to craft specialised machinery that can process your ingredients further, and even create new recipe components whilst you tend to an eclectic mix of animal livestock from cows to unicorns! And don't forget to repair and customise your dilapidated (and slightly haunted) villa!<br /><br />VISIT AMBROSIA<br />Welcome to Ambrosia, a place of gastronomic delight and agriculture wonder, renowned the world over. You are free to explore all that Ambrosia has to offer, from winding narrow streets to lush green fields, from quaint restaurants to bustling taverns, all full to the brim with 'friendly' locals eager to meet you.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.<br /><br />From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddy bear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!<br /><br />Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?",

Communications were lost and my submarine crashed on the ocean floor. I survived, but my oxygen is running low and I can't contact anyone for help. All I can do is move forward with this operations drone as my only companion. Trouble is, it's been acting sort of weird lately.

Search the ocean floor as you discover and extract samples from the bowels of the underwater caves. Danger lurks in each passageway, everything from poison drifts to powerful ocean currents, mines leftover from the war... There's also the ever-present risk of running out of oxygen.

Four levels of difficulty, six worlds to conquer, twelve mid and end-of-level bosses, seven god-like armour sets, five basic weapons and thirty-five magic combat spells!<br /><br />The evil emperor Zaraaima has kidnapped the infant heir to the land of Dareca. King Kandar must call upon the aid of the seven gods of Dareca as he traverses the six worlds of his kingdom in a bid to save his son. He must face the emperor's hordes as he battles through dark woods, slimy swamps, sinister mills, infernal volcanos, snowy mountains, golden cities and demonic castles. Each world is guarded by level bosses each sworn to bring about the king's swift demise. To help him in his quest King Kandar can invoke god-given armour, wield different weapons and cast fanatical spells. Can the King save his son and his kingdom or will Dareca fall into the evil emperor's grasp? <br /><br />Cast of the Seven Godsends - Redux is developed by Raven Travel Studios, production support from IV Productions and published by Merge Games Ltd. © 2015.

Use stealth and tactics to overcome the never-ending onslaught of monsters, the manifestations of your god's decay.<br /><br />DEFINITIVE UPDATE:<br />▪ 3 new enemy types. Prepare to fight swarms of feral bats, witches of the wood, and elder vampires.<br />▪ 30 new weapons with unique abilities to add to your arsenal.<br />▪ Overwatch added to ease up your ambushes. Snipe any foes running into your range.<br />▪ Tug of war mechanics. Push a beast into a trap or pull it into the range of ally's overwatch.<br />▪ Rebalance of corruption system. Cursed weapons and items give you immense power but at a cost of slowly losing yourself.<br />▪ New questline: uncover dark secrets of House Blackwell.<br />▪ New hunter skin - hunt in style.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br />▪ Stealth, ambush-based combat. Try to outsmart and outwit all the horrifying creatures you'll be facing, as they are way stronger and you don't stand a chance in a direct assault;<br />▪ Diverse, challenging opponents. From werewolves to vampires, all monsters have their unique attacks and skills and can easily see, hear or smell you from the distance. So be careful not to reveal your position too early;<br />▪ Stamina-based characters. Cautiously manage your energy level between attacking, moving and casting spells. In the end, you're only a human and running out of energy will seriously fatigue you;<br />▪ A grim world plunged in half-darkness. In this world, our god has finally turned his back on us and his corrupt presence can change the intensity of the battlefield. From summoning monsters, through changing the weather, to transforming one of the creatures into a powerful avatar of his will;<br />▪ A vagabond's exploration system. Travel the world bringing your mobile base along with you. Take shelter in and manage your camp, but be wary of enemy ambushes;<br />▪ A unique fusion of dark Victorian fantasy and wild west. Immerse yourself in a world so different from the one you know. The universe shaped by struggle, where mankind has not had the freedom to develop or advance any of its technology.<br /><br />Manage your scarce resources, venture out with your fellow companions and explore the remnants of the world in search of the means for mankind's survival.<br /><br />Monsters can detect a hunter's presence by their scent, they can then use this to track down where the hunters are. Observe the wind - keeping yourself downwind of your adversaries will aid you in your hunt. Although, hunters can use their scent to their advantage by preparing an ambush using traps, then luring the monsters towards it.<br /><br />Monsters are not the only threat the hunters will face on their hunts - the presence of the old god is growing ever stronger, changing everything it touches. The darkness can summon more enemies against the hunters, or even change them into an avatar of its will.<br /><br />Hunters can equip different weapons, heavy, more powerful ones that will drain their stamina when used.<br />And smaller ones, better for stealth actions.<br /><br />Within their camp, our hunters can craft new items or get some rest.<br />In addition, we can assign roles to hunters there, e.g. to make one of them guard the camp and protect it from ambushes, or to give them the role of a scavenger, who will collect resources in the region of the camp.<br /><br />Remember, this is not the world you know.<br />This is a world that has been shaped by struggle, one where mankind has not had the freedom to develop and advance its technology.<br /><br />Your resources will be limited, and opportunities rare.",

The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food café, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District.<br /><br />Ever wondered what it's like to be Satan's son? Nothing special... Unleashed lust, chronic alcoholism and reckless shooting - the usual routine. Save Hell! Wait... What? Yup, that's right - Hell! It's not the place it used to be - Hell's been possessed. Possessed by the most vile dark hideous evil the world has known - people. They've turned your precious homeland into a madhouse, and only you can stop them! What's in it for you? Spectacular locations, battles with epic bosses and a nice mixture of pain and nonsense.",

There's no time to lose, so join Nika, get your hands on MechaNika's controls and demolish the entire planet. You have to put an end to history books, planned obsolescence, kitschy dresses, never-ending sagas of boring video games and pea soup.<br /><br />And if there's someone in the world that hates vegetables more than Nika, it's her friend Agatha, the insomniac butcher and prophetess of Carnivorism that loves animals and their succulent meat in equal measure. That's why, when she learns of the objectives of Nika's plan, she doesn't hesitate to join the mission of destruction alongside the Great Bleeding Pig, god of Carnivorism, to subdue any grass-eating, non-believers that get in the way.<br /><br />But watch out, because along the way you'll realise that Nika and Agatha are not the only ones that have a plan to change the world, and not everything's as simple as it might have seemed at the start. You'll have to make some tough and irreversible decisions to achieve your objectives, or renounce them.<br /><br />- Join forces with Nika, get behind the controls of MechaNika and bring an end to everything that isn't cool.<br />- Convert your mission into a cooperative experience for 2 players with Agatha and the Great Bleeding Pig.<br />- Manage your resources during combat and execute endless, strategic combos to cause more and more harm to your enemies.<br />- Unlock the dumbshredder, the chopping tornado, the groundcracker, the scarlet vomit and up to 8 devastating special attacks.<br />- Take on innumerable challenges in a combination of beat'em up, shoot'em up, platforming and puzzles.<br />- Discover the Neon District, Candyland and the rest of the Psychotic world through 18 totally distinct levels.<br />- Locate all of the geeky references, illustrated in a unique visual style.<br />- Revel in an original, varied, dynamic and immersive soundtrack.<br />- Take crucial and thought-provoking decisions during your quest and discover the 4 alternative endings for this epic and twisted adventure.<br />- Complete the mission with infinite lives or with just one chance in permadeath mode, if you dare...",

A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies.<br /><br />Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered.

Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion.

Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents.<br /><br />You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.<br /><br />During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands.<br /><br />If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.<br /><br />You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode.<br /><br />Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.<br /><br />In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.<br /><br />If you can survive long enough to find it.",

        "description": "Order of Battle: World War II is a turn-based strategy game with an impressive variety of scenarios and theatres of war. Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system.<br /><br />COMMANDERS<br /><br />A set of unique Commanders – split between Generals, Pilots and Captains – is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor.<br /><br />SUPPLY SYSTEM<br /><br />In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory.<br />THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED<br />The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941.<br />On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War.<br /><br />In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg.<br /><br />This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units.<br /><br />12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />Classic turn based, hex based gameplay with an intuitive UI and great depth.<br />Play in dynamic campaigns with unit carryover and multiple \"what-if\" scenarios.<br />A rich 3D world with detailed animations and effects<br />20 different Specializations give a unique feel to each faction including Banzai Charge, Bushido Code and even the Manhattan Project.<br />Over a thousand different unit types, including infantry, tanks, ships and aircraft, each with unique visuals and animations<br />Attach unique commanders to your units to give them additional offensive and defensive bonuses<br />A deep but intuitive supply system allowing breakthroughs & encirclements.",

        "description": "My Friend Pedro is a violent ballet about friendship, imagination, and one man's struggle to obliterate anyone in his path at the behest of a sentient banana. The strategic use of split aiming, slow motion, and the ol' stylish window breach create one sensational action sequence after another in an explosive battle through the violent underworld.<br /><br />Unleash a torrent of destruction with an incredible level of control over both your weapons and your body. Twist and turn through the air while aiming both hands at priority threats or line up a perfect ricochet to drop an unsuspecting gangster from behind.<br /><br />Break up the high octane running and gunning a bit with dynamic sequences like a thrilling motorcycle chase or slow it all down and take a moment to think through a series of clever (and possibly fatal) physics-based puzzles.",

        "description": "John Wick Hex is a fast-paced, action-oriented strategy game that makes you think and strike like John Wick, the professional hitman of the critically acclaimed film franchise. Created in close cooperation with the creative teams behind the films, John Wick Hex is fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game, capturing the series' signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe. Players must make quick decisions and choose every action and attack they make, all the while considering their immediate cost and consequences.<br /><br />Featuring a unique blend of strategic time-based action, John Wick Hex captures the feel of the tactical combat from the films and blurs the line between the strategy and action video game genres. Perform well and progress in the main story mode to unlock new weapons, suit options and locations. Each weapon changes up the tactics you'll use and the manner in which you'll play. Ammo is finite and realistically simulated, so time your reloads and make the most of weapons you scavenge on the job.<br /><br />Experience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game's eponymous villain 'Hex'. John Wick Hex compliments the style of the films with a unique graphic noir art design and an original score by renowned composer Austin Wintory.",

Their analysts broke it down and determined it was of intelligent origin.

In secret, the corporation began construction of Trailblazer Alpha, a state-of-the-art Mars research outpost designed to identify the true nature of the message.<br /><br />You are Shane Newehart, an engineer stationed at Trailblazer Alpha and your security clearance means you are completely unaware of the existence of the mysterious signal. Your job is simply to keep the lights on until the transport ship Cyrano arrives bringing with it a new team to take over your duties.<br /><br />Soon you discover strange and unusual setbacks. Crucial systems are malfunctioning, the greenhouse is filled with a strange mist and the rest of your team has yet to return from their EVA mission. <br />Things are starting to fall apart.<br /><br />You begin seeing and hearing things that aren't there.

Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.<br /><br />Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the ''interludes,'' which were originally published separately, available now on PlayStation 4 for the first time. Also for the first time, it has been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).",

Monsters, nomads, mercenaries, living deads and rebellious spirits — Chaos does not sleep and besieges the Universe.

It is better to shed a gallon of blood than lose a single leaf from the Tree of Order.<br /><br />Think and rule!<br />Mittelborg claims for your unfaltering watch, Chancellor! Different events enforce you to make hard decisions all the time. Whom will you sacrifice: a warrior or a mage? Do you execute or pardon? Spend aether on the repairs or upgrades of weapons? Power is a heavy burden. Will you protect the most sacred, or will you drench it in blood...<br /><br />Fight, die, fight again!<br />Human life is worth nothing where waves of Chaos swamp the shores of Order. It is so easy to die here, and no one worries about tomorrow. No one but you! You are the immortal one. Each reborn is new knowledge. You hone the strategy and save all previous experience, and it will help you endure a little bit longer this time.<br /><br />The world is huge.<br />You start a long and dangerous adventure.

The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won't be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character.<br /><br />Plot<br />The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King's daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter's hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King's blessing.  <br />The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. <br />The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose.<br /><br />• The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty. As you progress, you'll come across Easter eggs, things that'll crack you up and allusions to other games coupled with self-mockery<br /><br />• Randomly generated locations of items, artifacts, traps, rooms in the building, enemies and bosses<br /><br />• 12 characters, all with different performance and equipment<br /><br />• Customized equipment which can be upgraded with rocks, runes and enchantments<br /><br />• Secret features and tricks (e.g. get a firesword by plunging your sword into the lava)<br /><br />• Jaw-dropping action with various moves, skills and spells!<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console",

Pressure from hotel staff and your own limp wrists are against you, but with over 36 weapons, and a World Tour ahead of you, it's time to get creative.<br /><br />Each hotel is a playground of physics-based demolition, with time to explore and plan your strategy before lighting the fireworks and trying to keep the Manager out. With a hellish pawn shop of weirdly satisfying weapons – including Wet Fish, Cattle Prods, C4 and Guns – and a stack of Challenges to appease The Devil, becoming the most Infamous takes brains as well as looks.<br /><br />Get the band together for Party Setlists (Pass and Play) or try out ideas at your own pace in Sandbox mode. Hotel R'n'R is a satirical journey of selling your soul and then trying to take it back along the way there's no shortage of luxury hotels, sarcastic maids and ragdoll physics mayhem.

It's divided by a long serving counter, yet the produce and the appliances you both need are placed on the opposite sides of the room. Your job is to cooperate, cook together and serve orders of steaming, delicious food. Chop, stir and fry everything you can while throwing (at) your partner all the ingredients they need. Prove that cooking is a piece of cake as long as you do it together!<br /><br />Features<br />- Everybody can have a taste. The game can be enjoyed by kids, teenagers, adults, and elders alike. Make cooking THE opportunity to forge new bonds and refine existing ones.<br />- Use your noodle. To complete orders as efficiently as possible, rely on your planning and communication skills; reflex and agility are considered a side dish in this kitchen.<br />- Fresh challenges everyday. Each level brings new ingredients, appliances and recipes to the table, raising the difficulty level bit-by-bit. <br />- Different foods call for different measures. Earn stars to progress through the game. Unlock new restaurants, upgrade your cooking gear to meet ever-changing cooking standards, and gain access to new character skins. <br />- Never overeat on fun.

Most of the robotic units are controlled by the virus. Lead a squad of 4 prototypes on a mission to defend complex mainframe. You'll have to repel assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and do more on your way to the deepest parts of the complex. Work with item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and return fire. But don't rely on a single strategy too much - enemies might have a way to counter it. But above everything else: defend the Mainframe!<br /><br />• RETRO STYLE: Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack.<br /><br />• DIVERSE TACTICS: Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets, eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind.<br /><br />• BUILD YOUR SQUAD: Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in MAINFRAME DEFENDERS you have to combine different items with unique abilities, to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build!<br /><br />• UNIQUE ENEMIES: Enemy squad won't sit idle, though. Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you will lose.<br /><br />• PROCEDURAL LEVELS: Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk falling behind?<br /><br />• PROGRESSION SYSTEM: Victory or defeat, the game is not over yet! Unlock new units, each with a unique set of upgrades and load-outs. Unlock new items to bolster your new strategies.<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console",

Perhaps it's the chocolate shake with a shot of cognac she carries in her backpack which makes her different.

It doesn't matter if her parents don't listen to her. It doesn't matter if her teacher ignores her. It doesn't matter if her classmates are dorks. Nothing matters anymore because she has a plan to solve everything. A really… odd plan.<br /><br />• A different adventure where you will join Nika in her quest to complete MechaNika. Go for it!<br />• Extremely cool and colorful visuals, all hand-drawn!<br />• You will face many puzzles with different ways to be solved.

If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage!<br /><br />Enter the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire.<br /><br />Eons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual: The fairy scholar Lilibri, the tiefling delinquent Strelitz, human tailor twins Penny & Deony, the dwarven treasure hunter Ore Kid, the beastkin freelancer Daize, the legendary centaur dancer Yosoti, and the errant elven knight Rosalia. Each of them has their own wish, and their own story to tell.<br /><br />Challenge the Story Mode to take your chosen character through their tale, challenging all the others in fierce puzzle battles to assemble all seven Sacred Blossoms! Shoot for high scores in Solo Play, racing the clock or rationing limited moves to get the highest rank you can! Solve puzzling brain-teasers with limited moves in the Puzzle Mode, and make your own puzzles in the Puzzle Editor! Challenge another player or fight the CPU in Versus Mode, racing to make clears and bury your opponent!<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

        "description": "Preventive Strike is a dynamic arcade scroll-shooter. You control an overpowered attack helicopter with the objective to drive the enemy out of your land and make your way to the enemy base and eliminate the threat. They don't know what's coming, but neither do you!<br /><br />The game has an isometric view on the level, which stands out from the typical for this genre top-down or side view and adds some depth to the environment. The graphics are simple yet eye-catching, with lots of stuff happening on screen. There's no room for boredom.<br /><br />Key features include most of what you'd expect to see in an arcade shooter: fluid controls, a variety of enemies, power-ups, changing environments, player progression, score, and more.<br /><br />Do you dare to be the one man army?!<br /><br />Show them bullet hell!",
