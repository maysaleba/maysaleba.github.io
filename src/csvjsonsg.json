In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt.

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community. Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes,\" which were originally published separately, available now on PlayStation 4 for the first time.

Explore the nature of good and evil, learn the true cost of power, and rise as a Mythic Hero capable of deeds beyond mortal expectations. Discover the Story Your path will lead you to the Worldwound, where the opening of a rift to the Abyss has unleashed all-consuming terror across the land. For over a century, the neighboring nations have fought fearlessly, trying to drive the enemy back \u2014 but to little avail. Now, you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel, backed by noble paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else entirely? Lead your army and challenge mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will leave you \u2014 and the world itself \u2014 forever changed. PLAY YOUR HERO, YOUR WAY Create any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset. Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle. FOR EVERY CHOICE, A CONSEQUENCE Your decisions have more weight than ever before. Your goal is clear, but you must forge your own path to it. Who will die, and who will live? Who will stay, and who will go? Make your choices, and watch the world around you change. A NEW WAY TO FIGHT Enjoy two combat modes as you slay your enemies \u2013 real-time with pause or turn-based. Switch between them on the fly, so you can always take things as slowly \u2014 or as quickly \u2014 as you like. The unique Pathfinder ruleset also allows you to perform advanced combat maneuvers, like mounted combat. Use them wisely! GATHER YOUR PARTY A cast of more than 10 unique companions is ready to join your cause. Earn their trust and respect, and they will have your back no matter what dangers lie ahead. And if you get on their bad side, well\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s time to part ways. LEAD THE CRUSADE You will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of its demonic scourge. Take command of the crusaders and lead them to victory \u2013 both as a strategist, controlling the battle from above, and as a field commander, in a new tactical combat mode. CHOOSE YOUR PATH Explore nine unique Mythic Paths: obtain extraordinary abilities and shape everything that comes next. Your decisions might transform you into a celestial Angel, a raging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, an otherworldly Aeon, a rebellious Azata, a wise Gold Dragon, an insatiable Swarm That Walks \u2014 or remain mortal and walk the arduous path toward becoming a living Legend.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/83856","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/0418/aC9jmq4nJFtNWTjUcTW9h23h.png?w=200","MainStory":52,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/EP6008-CUSA35021_00-3515132086703036","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoCBgO8qS70","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":191,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":40.74,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/0418/aC9jmq4nJFtNWTjUcTW9h23h.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous","Title":"Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (Simplified Chinese, English)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Postmeta Games Limited","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-28","Slug":"pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-simplified-chinese-english-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":67.9,"MainExtra":129,"SalePrice":47.53,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"80","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"The stakes are Ultimate, the tension is Maximum, the fight is\u2026 the ULTIMAX!

Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/87808","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/UP0102-CUSA24159_00-MAKAIRE000000001","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F177-VTSGSM","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":22,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":19.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection","Title":"Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection (Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Capcom U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-31","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-simplified-chinese-english-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":39,"MainExtra":7,"SalePrice":19.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"Why have friends if not to play Golf...

We celebrate the lives we've been given, and offer up prayers for the next. It is grief of death which shackles the living, and causes the dead to stray. Indeed, there is no greater affront to reincarnation. So we turn our grief to joy as we send the dead off with smiles. But the souls of those who held back their tears in life still need salvation in death. A duty that falls to the Watchers. Their task is to guide the wandering souls known as the Lost, and serve as keepers of the Living World and the Beyond. The Watchers sever the bonds that tie the Lost to this world, and send them on to the next. They navigate the emotions of the living and the dead. They prize life above all else. This is the story of one Watcher. ◆Features The player takes the role of Kagachi, a Watcher, as he travels between the Living World, the world of the living, and the Beyond, the world of the dead, saving the Lost. To fulfill his duty as a Watcher, Kagachi (the player) battles monsters by allowing Daemons to possess him, giving him access to a variety of job skills and abilities. Kagachi can bind up to four Daemons at the same time and switch between them in real time during combat with one simple press of a button. Each Daemon has a distinctive set of skills, a unique weapon such as a katana, spear, axe or scythe, and a different play style. Switch Daemons in and out of combat strategically to gain an advantage over your foes. ONINAKI has a weapon and Daemon customization system inspired by hack-and-slash games and an incredible amount of replay value.

Seen as the answer to all the kingdom\u2019s ailments, alchemy became a widely used practice across the land, with denizens welcoming it into their homes, using it to enhance and heal as they saw fit. When the price of alchemy became too steep, attempts to halt its use were made, each as woefully unsuccessful as the last, with the catastrophic consequences felt across the realm. Within days, the kingdom fell to chaos, infected monsters prowling the blood-soaked streets, all hope of a cure lost. Corvus is the kingdom\u2019s final hope, the fate of Hermes resting in his feathered hands. The truth is buried deep in the memories Corvus left scattered throughout the punishing world, and only by collecting these lost memories can the kingdom be saved, but each time he dives back in, trying to piece together the truth, all he finds is more secrets.

[Game Description] The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki is a completely new game in the Kiseki series. The sprawling Republic of Calvard is experiencing an unprecedented economic boom brought on by post-war reparations. At the same time, feelings of uncertainty stemming from a massive influx of immigrants and bold political reform by the new president are rife. Deep within its capital city, a young Spriggan man receives a strange request that threatens to plunge the entire nation into chaos\u2026 [Prologue] The Spriggan is a type of undeground agent, born in the melting pot of diversity that is the Republic of Calvard. Spriggans take on any and all requests, acting as detectives, negotiators, or even as bounty hunters. They subcontract requests that the police can't handle, consult with citizens on matters that can't be brought to light, and even take on legitimate requests from criminals and underground forces. This earned them the apt nickname \"jack-of-all-trades\". In the year 1208, a well-to-do student dressed in the uniform of a prestigious school visits an old building located deep within the Republic's capital. The girl stares at the plaque, upon which Arkride Solutions Office is emblazoned in plain letters. She clears her throat and then knocks three times. \"How odd, we don't receive many callers before noon...\" The calm voice of a surprisingly young, though mature-sounding man is heard from within, and the doorknob slowly starts to turn. And thus, our story begins.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/0701/6K0WE5g3uTqE92ribQ39uWwi.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP5846-PPSA07728_00-KURONOKISEKIDE01","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":74.34,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/0701/6K0WE5g3uTqE92ribQ39uWwi.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki Digital Deluxe Edition (Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"CLOUDED LEOPARD ENTERTAINMENT INC.","ReleaseDate":"2022-07-27","Slug":"the-legend-of-heroes-kuro-no-kiseki-digital-deluxe-edition-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":106.2,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":74.34,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"Get ready to blaze through your enemies with as much firepower as you can carry!

The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game making it the definitive version on consoles of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience. Man Meets Magic & Machine In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It\u2019s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge\u2019s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the \u201cFlux State\u201d controls the city of Berlin. It\u2019s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there\u2019s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return\u2026 Key Features A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG\u2019s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development.

Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director\u2019s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into. Command Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it\u2019s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.

Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades. Shadowrun Returns The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Nearly 10 years ago, creator Jordan Weisman returned to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city\u2019s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It\u2019s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge\u2019s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the \u201cFlux State\u201d controls the city of Berlin. It\u2019s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there\u2019s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return\u2026 Shadowrun Hong Kong - Extended Edition HONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. As an ex-con living in Seattle, you try to make an honest living but when your foster begs you to meet him in China, things turn grim and you find out the police are trying to arrest you. And by arrest, they mean to kill you on sight! Build your team of Shadowrunners, mercenaries with big personalities who can fight using mystical or technical powers, and turn the tables on the elite corporate and the police.

The Firestarters offered a compromise: they recognized the girl\u2019s potential and took her with them, continuing not only to nurture her cruelty but also providing her with occult knowledge. However, the shamans soon cast the young witch out for her different view of their ideology: while fire was the most important element for them, Alva drew her strength from death. She believed that by killing a man in a fair fight, one could take away the power of the defeated. For years Alva wandered through the woods, communicating with spirits and searching for her destiny, until eventually she stumbled upon an abandoned armoured car in a cave in the swamp. The young woman decided that the vehicle was inhabited by an ancient raven spirit named Kutkh, who needed to absorb souls in order to live. The witch was able to start the car and returned to her father, who immediately offered Alva to become his bodyguard. Such cooperation was beneficial for everyone: the attempts on Petrolium\u2019s life happened quite often, and Alva with her armoured vehicle were eager to kill.

Based on the cult role-playing game and developed by specialists in the genre, Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Swansong is a narrative RPG in which your every choice determines the fate of the three main characters and of the Boston Camarilla. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF DARKNESS What if vampires were real? What if these bloodthirsty predators lived hidden among us in complex societies and had been hatching conspiracies for thousands of years? And what if you became one of them? In Vampire: The Masquerade, you play as these alluring monsters in a sophisticated world where the lines between the real and supernatural are always blurred. A HEART-POUNDING THRILLER Hazel Iversen, the Swan, is the new Prince of the Boston Camarilla. An iron hand in a velvet glove, she intends to assert her power and respect the Masquerade, the vampiric law designed to ensure humans never learn of the existence of these creatures of the night. But nothing works as planned. With rumours of plots, murders and power struggles, you must work in the shadows to protect your Sect in a pulsating investigation that plunges Boston into chaos.

Progress in the game through their intertwined destinies, deal with their different points of view and use their character sheets to try to separate the truth from the lies. Each character has their own vampiric abilities and disciplines that you can upgrade individually to suit your preferred approach. Will you choose intimidation, seduction or stealth?

The legendary mercenary Wolfhound has stopped contacting his customers a long time ago. Of course, many thought that the Valley had ruined him, but in fact it was a man who tried to do so. Which is not surprising, considering how many enemies a hired killer can have. One night, when Wolfhound arrived at a routine meeting with his client, the mercenary was ambushed. The abandoned plant, where the meeting was supposed to take place, was turned into a pile of rubble and dust, but the vigilantes could not find Wolfhound\u2019s body in it. They couldn\u2019t find his car either. The mercenary\u2019s enemies celebrated their victory and went on with their lives, forgetting about Wolfhound like a bad dream. But a few years later, one of the vigilantes fell into a familiar snare, and seconds later all that was left of his armored car was a flaming pile of metal. One by one, those who had once tried to destroy the mercenary began to die under similar circumstances, and all of them met the same unfortunate end. Wolfhound has returned, but he stopped killing for money. Now all those who had once used his services started to die. The rumors about the emergence of a terrifying ghost named Barghest started to spread around the Valley. People just couldn\u2019t believe that the mercenary could have survived that attempt on his life, and decided that he had really become a ghost. A far more dangerous and terrifying ghost than Wolfhound himself had been. The unique armoured car presented in the pack is known for its balance of weapons, combination of modules and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the \u201cPacks\u201d tab, select the desired armoured car and click the \u201cAssemble\u201d button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases to 55. Attention! Storage overflow is possible under certain conditions. Buying the pack also gives early access to several structural parts. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy. Unique portraits provide an excellent opportunity to stand out among the survivors. Paint cans are a way to make your armored car different from the pack. Coins \u2014 is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention! When buying multiple packs, the acquired coins stack!","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2112/seAGJJ0JuFb978ziSiYuap7Z.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/EP4432-CUSA06859_00-EB00870000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Simulation, Unique","PlusPrice":33.95,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2112/seAGJJ0JuFb978ziSiYuap7Z.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Crossout \u2013 Barghest (English Ver.)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Gaijin Distribution KFT","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-25","Slug":"crossout--barghest-english-ver-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":67.9,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":33.95,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"Embark on an epic adventure full of whimsy, wonder, and high-powered weaponry!

[Game Description] The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki is a completely new game in the Kiseki series. The sprawling Republic of Calvard is experiencing an unprecedented economic boom brought on by post-war reparations. At the same time, feelings of uncertainty stemming from a massive influx of immigrants and bold political reform by the new president are rife. Deep within its capital city, a young Spriggan man receives a strange request that threatens to plunge the entire nation into chaos\u2026 [Prologue] The Spriggan is a type of undeground agent, born in the melting pot of diversity that is the Republic of Calvard. Spriggans take on any and all requests, acting as detectives, negotiators, or even as bounty hunters. They subcontract requests that the police can't handle, consult with citizens on matters that can't be brought to light, and even take on legitimate requests from criminals and underground forces. This earned them the apt nickname \"jack-of-all-trades\". In the year 1208, a well-to-do student dressed in the uniform of a prestigious school visits an old building located deep within the Republic's capital. The girl stares at the plaque, upon which Arkride Solutions Office is emblazoned in plain letters. She clears her throat and then knocks three times. \"How odd, we don't receive many callers before noon...\" The calm voice of a surprisingly young, though mature-sounding man is heard from within, and the doorknob slowly starts to turn.

Hoxxes IV has the highest concentration of valuable minerals ever discovered; however, everything on the planet from the creatures to the fauna is extremely hostile. Good thing Deep Rock Galactic employs the best space miners in the universe: Dwarves! Combining two things Dwarves love most - mining and killing monsters - Hoxxes is the perfect job for any proud, space-faring Dwarf. *** 4-player Co-Op *** Work together as a team to dig, explore, and fight your way through a massive cave system filled with hordes of deadly enemies and valuable resources. You will need to rely on your teammates if you want to survive the most hostile cave systems in the galaxy! *** 4 Unique Classes *** Pick the right class for the job. Mow through enemies as the Gunner, scout ahead and light up the caves as the Scout, chew through solid rock as the Driller, or support the team with defensive structures and turrets as the Engineer. *** Fully Destructible Environments *** Destroy everything around you to reach your goal. There is no set path so you can complete your mission your way. Drill straight down to your objective or build an intricate network of paths to explore your surroundings -- the choice is yours. But proceed with caution, you don\u2019t want to stumble into an alien swarm unprepared! *** Procedurally Generated Cave Network *** Explore a network of procedurally generated cave systems filled with enemies to fight and riches to collect. There\u2019s always something new to discover and no two playthroughs are alike. *** High-Tech Gadgets and Weapons *** Dwarves know what they need to bring to get the job done. This means the most powerful weapons and the most advanced gadgets around - flamethrowers, gatling guns, portable platform launchers, and much, much more. *** Light Your Path *** The underground caves are dark and full of terrors. You will need to bring your own lights if you want to illuminate these pitch-black caverns.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/47169","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/2310/1FjFdcGWmeuOpjGpodm1XYOj.png?w=200","MainStory":56,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/EP4837-PPSA02962_00-DRGFULLGAMEPS5EU","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyFFQt1S85c","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":613,"genre":"Action, Shooter, Action","PlusPrice":13.82,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/2310/1FjFdcGWmeuOpjGpodm1XYOj.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Deep Rock Galactic PS4 & PS5 (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"COFFEE STAIN PUBLISHING AB","ReleaseDate":"2022-01-03","Slug":"deep-rock-galactic-ps4--ps5-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":41.9,"MainExtra":111,"SalePrice":13.82,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"The Rival Tech Pack will let you deck out all your guns in theme with our new enemies - no reason to let all those lovely bits go to waste, after all!

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You\u2019re the only human there, after all. SURVIVAL Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game \u2013 including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™\u2019s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/80159","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0114/xvUwYjctSRFXETMYPdfkwDUc.png?w=200","MainStory":23,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP0507-PPSA04872_00-8740332137435014","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9cj2mae5w","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":46,"genre":"Action, Strategy","PlusPrice":24.78,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0114/xvUwYjctSRFXETMYPdfkwDUc.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Riftbreaker (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Marvelous Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-13","Slug":"the-riftbreaker-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":41.3,"MainExtra":35,"SalePrice":24.78,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"Additional content for \"LOST JUDGEMENT\".

PLAYSTATION 5 ENHANCEMENTS Enjoy massively reduced loading times thanks to the SSD and experience an augmented level of immersion with the Dual Sense controller. Feel object resistance, surface texture, damage feedback, heartbeat simulation and more thanks to the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. SYSTEM REDUX Veteran Observers can dive deeper into this dystopian reality thanks to three brand-new side cases to solve. \u201cErrant Signal\u201d, \u201cHer Fearful Symmetry\u201d and \u201cIt Runs in the Family\u201d add another layer of depth to the game\u2019s story while exploring thought-provoking themes of a future that soon might become our present. On top of that, System Redux offers expanded gameplay, which includes new game mechanics, new secrets to find, redesigned stealth, additional neural interrogations, and quality-of-life improvements made with the help of the Observer community. Newcomers get the chance to experience one of the most thrilling cyberpunk stories in all its next-gen glory: boasting 4K resolution, upgraded textures, new animations, models and effects, and transformed with jaw-dropping Ray-Tracing and HDR lighting. WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects\u2019 minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion. But remember, no matter how deep you go, you can never hide from an Observer.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/82626","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/UP4176-PPSA02118_00-8840415776217330","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RseKlXtD8cE","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":13,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Observer: System Redux (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"Bloober Team","ReleaseDate":"2021-07-22","Slug":"observer-system-redux-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":41.9,"MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":20.95,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"A video game about secret lives, the ties that bind and how magic can be found in the mundane.

FIGHT ACROSS EPIC BATTLEFIELDS From the ruins of ancient Sentinel settlements and the cosmic wonders of the World Spear, to a devastated and overgrown city on Earth hiding a mysterious gateway, face Hell\u2019s armies in never-before-seen locations as you fight your way to Immora, the last bastion of the Dark Lord protected by towering walls and powered by advanced technology. FACE CHALLENGING ENEMY VARIANTS Face new, deadly variants of demons. The Armored Baron wears special armor and uses a charged fist attack. The Stone Imp possesses a nearly impenetrable hide and prefers close combat. The Screecher is a zombie that empowers nearby demons when killed. The Cursed Prowler is a mutation with venomous, cursed claws. Exploit their weaknesses to destroy them. WIELD THE SENTINEL HAMMER Deliver more destruction with the Sentinel Hammer, an ancient weapon capable of stopping any demons caught within its shockwave. Use it to stun demons or combine it with the Ice Bomb or Flame Belch to extract much-needed health or armor.

What if that wasn\u2019t sadness, but a deep malevolence, born of a life spent in the pursuit of drink and gluttony?

His hard work paid off and he traded his island for an archipelago, miles away from home. In Japan, he shares the lessons he worked so hard to learn on his own. But nothing prepared him for this course. If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

It\u2019s hosted by everyone\u2019s favorite curmudgeon Razmi with plenty of comic dialogue between her and Ajna. Razmi has decided to annoy Ajna by challenging her to do something impossible, promising a \u201creward.\u201d Ajna accepts the first challenge and after the player succeeds at it, Razmi claims it was part of 40 things you have to do, but Ajna remains optimistic and is willing to go through all of them. Razmi is discouraged by Ajna's continued success but is determined to make Ajna look foolish, so keeps coming up with new absurd challenges. As the player continues, other fan-favourite characters tell Razmi that it is getting to be too much, which Razmi stubbornly ignores. \u2022 Missions are gated by players\u2019 current story progress. These will be spread across the game for players starting from early on, with new sets of challenges unlocked at points in the story where they learn new abilities. \u2022 DLC will begin for players on a new save file once they have added Razmi to the party. DLC Overview: \u2022 40 self-contained challenge levels, each exploring mechanics from simple to advanced in a linear fashion. o World mechanic levels  Emphasizes combining learned moves such as Heruka Hustle (dash) into Pirate\u2019s Leap (high jump) in a series of challenges across a short linear level.  Each level assigns Ajna certain world traversal abilities and players must explore the imposed limitations. o Battle mechanic levels  Enemies with unique features that force the player to explore new ways to \u201csolve\u201d a battle  This will involve use of established battle mechanics, such as Iddhi meter building, Clean Blocking, and various \u201cbattle gimmicks\u201d like battle armor, physical attack resistance, and magic attack resistance. \u2022 Two new palettes. \u2022 New trophies and achievements. \u2022 A comic side-story with Ajna and Razmi as a framing device. \u2022 2-3 hours of content when played straight through (levels taking 3-5 minutes in one go) but the emphasis is on providing a challenge to the player so multiple re-tries should be expected. \u2022 Challenges will however start much easier and ramp up in difficulty as they are unlocked across the main game.

Set around a city being consumed from within by a disease, Plague Road tells a story of a lone doctor who once abandoned their home and now returns to learn the fate of those they left behind. Travel from the safe refuge of your farm through a series of regions progressively more affected by the infernal plague. On the road, rescue survivors and choose whether to use them as traveling companions or to improve the Doctor's farm and gain access to new abilities. How your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work. Some survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your ability to fight horrors created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring grid-based positioning and turn-based strategy mechanics.

Dead by Daylight is a 1v4 multiplayer game that draws from all corners of the horror world from a powerful slasher to a terrifying paranormal entity. Choose between playing an unstoppable Killer and one of four Survivors trying to evade a gruesome death. Survivors play in third-person with the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your personal strategy. The Special Edition of Dead by Daylight includes the base game, two additional chapters (Of Flesh and Mud, Spark of Madness) and two cosmetic add-ons packed with outfits for various characters (the 80's Suitcase for Survivors, the Bloodstained Sack for Killers). This edition gives you access to a roster of 7 Killers and 9 Survivors.
