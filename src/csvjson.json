Collect items to give you the upperhand while searching for your missing babies. Be on the lookout for your cousin - he's babysitting some of your relatives, but he's a little weird. With only a ticking clock and quick restarts - no lives or game overs - the game is welcoming to players of all experiences, but a formidable challenge to even the most capable of speedrunners. The world of Spinch has been crafted and brought to life by talented award-winning Canadian cartoonist, Jesse Jacobs, known for his precise and detailed line work in combination with bold and simple color palettes. His works contain an affiliation with psychedelia, spirituality, alternate realities, and a blending of nature with technology. James Kirkpatrick, well known for his participation in the early Canadian graffiti movement and as avant-garde hip-hop artist, Thesis Sahib, created the audio landscape of retro soundbites and electronic sounds found within Spinch.

The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won\u2019t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King\u2019s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter\u2019s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King\u2019s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose. \u2022 The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty.

This Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer. The player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down: If he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin; If he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points); If a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted. Fallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary. The winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25. So as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/skittles-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Sports,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"8.99","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Skittles.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"109","BrazilPrice":"14.99","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Skittles","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Pix Arts","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-26","Slug":"skittles-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 4 players","PolandPrice":"24","ChilePrice":"","Price":"5.99","MexicoPrice":"59.99","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"2.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"2.51","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-21","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-04-01","description":"Skee-Ball is officially licensed Skee-Ball arcade game.

Eighties of the twentieth century. The golden age of 8-bit video games. We were leaving school, and we were going to spend our precious coins in the arcade machines. One of the machines that personally caught my attention was Atari's Asteroids. How could something so simple be so addictive? How could they simulate the physics of that little white triangle on a black background in such a way? Asteroids was as simple as it gets. A simple black background, a white triangle, and figures representing asteroids, which were destroyed as we shot white dots from our triangle, which was our ship. Imagination did the rest. And the inertia effects were really amazing for the time. A tribute to Asteroids: Meteoroids 3D. Meteoroids 3D doesn't pretend anything except two things: to be a tribute to Asteroids, and to allow the player to go back to destroying space rocks in an absurd and crazy way. To do this we have created a modern game, with weapons and scenarios in three dimensions, but with the simplicity of the game of the time. Meteoroids 3D doesn't want to be better than Asteroids; that's impossible. What we want is to make a tribute. And that's all we want. We have added some aspects, besides the famous UFO: a demon, and some enemy ships that launch rockets to destroy us. Main features are: Features. Note: we highly recommend using a pad because you'll have more control flying the starship. 1.- 24 levels, that follow\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Meteoroids3d_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/meteoroids-3d-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":"","genre":"Arcade,Action","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"13.9","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Meteoroids3d.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"169","BrazilPrice":"19.16","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Meteoroids 3D","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"ISDEC Soluciones","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-29","Slug":"meteoroids-3d-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"39","ChilePrice":"","Price":"9.99","MexicoPrice":"79.60","MainExtra":"","SalePrice":"3.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"1.40","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-21","LowestPrice":"1.99","SaleStarted":"2022-03-31","description":"Micro Pico Racers is a fun top-down arcade racing game with a retro style graphics where you control of little cars racing over exciting tracks.

Mokoko X looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while adding a modern touch. There are 32 levels in Mokoko X; each level has its own unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes helping out with the insects in the kitchen. Gameplay You need to conquer a big portion of the initial area that you start the level. While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield empties. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however, deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly. If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and you will not be safe on your own areas as well. There are 3 difficulties in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and required conquered area percentage for the victory. What happens when you pass a level? You see the related girl's photo and can continue with her story or unlock the next girl. How many girls and bosses? 8 girls, 24 bosses, 24 minions, 24 levels, 8 mega levels, 4 traps, 4 power-ups, and 2 towers! Evil towers of course. Each boss and his minions were uniquely designed.

Big Drunk Satanic Massacre is basically a shooter with strong RPG elements - not that rocket propelled gun, though. The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food café, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging. The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects. Ever wondered what it's like to be Satan's son? Nothing special... Unleashed lust, chronic alcoholism and reckless shooting - the usual routine Save Hell! Wait... What? Yup, that's right - Hell!
