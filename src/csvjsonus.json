Play as Jeff and Debra, two small kiwi birds and the newest hires at the Bungalow Basin Telepost Office.<br /><br />With no hands to help them, the two must work together to jump, flap, peck and butt-slam their way across an interactive landscape of levers, buttons and bells to get the mail delivered on time. From the Dropoff Depot and the Shipping Floor, all the way to the Telegraph Desk and the Cassowary Coop out back, the Telepost is a well-oiled mail-processing machine...well, usually.<br /><br />Overcome Occupational Hazards:<br />Brave inclement weather (and even weirder stuff) while waddling through the Telepost's various mailrooms to ensure the residents of Bungalow Basin get their post. From swirling sandstorms and blizzards, to carnivorous plants and paranormal activity, it's all in a day's work for Jeff and Debra.<br /><br />Team Up or Be Your Own Boss:<br />Take control of both Jeff and Debra, and test your post processing skills in single-player mode, or team up with a friend to tackle mailroom mayhem in online and local co-op modes. No matter how you play, you'll have a little extra guidance from the Telepost's capable staff – a vibrant cast of postal professionals ready to help your kiwis complete their tasks.<br /><br />Collect Stamps to Customise Your Kiwis:<br />Coordinate your kiwis to get messages sent as fast as you can. You'll earn Stamps at the end of each postal shift, which can be used to unlock new wardrobe accessories to customise Jeff and Debra, making them the best-dressed mail birds in Bungalow Basin. Get creative with hats, facewear, backwear, hairstyles and feather patterns – there's no dress code at the Telepost!<br /><br />Keep an Eye Out for Collectibles:<br />All sorts of weird things have fallen into the nooks and crannies of the Telepost over the years, and curious kiwis can solve hidden puzzles to find Collectibles that reward special cosmetics.<br /><br />Experience More Mayhem with Overtime Shifts:<br />And don't forget you can earn Stamps from doing extra chores at the Telepost. Feed and exercise the cassowaries, plug up the leaky pipes in the basement, make sure the bubble wrap supply is quality controlled and build colleague morale with winter snowball fights; these are just some of the exciting overtime adventures that await!",

Inside My Radio lets you compose the track: YOU are in control, either with your actions, movements or jam zone, where you can freely choose and mix the tracks the way you want.<br /><br />The game is a mix-tape where every level is a different track: every level brings different variations to electro, disco or dub!<br /><br />Time Attack mode - It's rhythm or die time: the more you hit the beat, the higher your score multiplier goes, the better your score. Don't miss a beat or you will lose your multiplier AND get a time penalty!<br /><br />Made in France, by Seaven Studio.",

Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of.<br /><br />Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night.<br /><br />Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness. The game's cutscenes, quirky cast of characters, and the majestic Pacific Northwest vistas have been enhanced for an experience that delivers as much on its visual impact as its unnerving atmosphere.",

The clever mix of the military-style themed, side-scrolling action shooting / platform gameplay, with a wacky sense of humor and hilarious cartoon style met with an instant success among players around the world.<br /><br />The popularity of SNK's legendary action-shooting series has never shown any signs of slowing down over the years. To celebrate, the creators of METAL SLUG ANTHOLOGY stopped at nothing to provide a 2D, side-scrolling compilation with all the great gameplay possibilities into this complete arcade compilation.<br /><br />Each installment in the series included in METAL SLUG ANTHOLOGY offers unique, memorable gameplay and game objectives centered around a futuristic battle between the Regular and Rebel Army. The Regular Army gathered its scattered troops and launched a desperate counter attack recapturing the stolen Metal Slug, and using an arsenal of vehicles to destroy the opposition!<br /><br />An exclusive bonus PS4 Theme is available with the purchase of METAL SLUG ANTHOLOGY.<br /><br />This title has been converted from the original PlayStation2 version to the PS4 system. Consequently, there may be times where the title plays differently from the PlayStation2 version, or where some features may not function properly. This version does not support PlayStation2 peripherals, therefore some functionality may not be available.",

Each hole in the wasteland offers its own little story and possible puzzle to sink the perfect shot. Play through destroyed brutalist monuments, crumbling shopping malls, and abandoned museums as neon signs and poignant graffiti take swings at current events, Silicon Valley culture and humanity.<br /><br />Three Stories Make a (W)hole<br />Piece together the full story of how humanity fell through three distinct sources - Details from the lone golfer's story, who's come back to Earth for one last game. The Radio Nostalgia from Mars broadcast gives a glimpse into the lives of those who escaped, and the narration of  a “secret spectator” watching from a distance.<br /><br />The 1% Killed the Radio Star<br />Be accompanied by a purposefully composed soundtrack as well as personal stories broadcasted on Radio Nostalgia From Mars. The station caters to citizens of Mars, nostalgic for Earth as they listen to music from the 2020s, and dial in to share their memories of the planet. A smooth voiced radio DJ keeps the show flowing with updates and announcements hinting to a not so glamorous life on Mars.<br /><br />Fits Like a Glove<br />Three distinct modes mean every golfer can find something for their tastes. Casual players can focus just on the story and a relaxing scenic round of golf in Story Mode. Those looking for an extra challenge can beat each hole under par using skill and puzzle solving through Challenge Mode. While the total pros can try Iron Mode, where there's almost zero room for error. Easy to grasp controls and a minimalist UI underpin the whole game so anyone can easily pick up and play at their own pace.<br /><br />That's a Keeper<br />Included with every copy of the game is the digital Golf Club Wasteland Official Soundtrack plus a Graphic Novel Art Book that further expands the back story of the lone golfer Charley in stunning visual format.",

So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown!<br /><br />Story<br /><br />A long time ago...<br /><br />In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.<br />The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.<br />...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames,<br />a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.<br /><br />The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.<br />Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.<br />And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.<br />While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.<br /><br />In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.<br />To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy!<br /><br />Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins.<br /><br />In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these—and more—to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!<br /><br />In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!<br /><br />Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it!<br /><br />On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience—a first for the series.<br /><br />Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side.<br />Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported.<br /><br />Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled",

It follows the story of a fragile little fur creature and its desperate attempt to rescue its mate from the clutches of a pack of malicious predators. The journey to the heart of a mysterious forest soon becomes a savage and merciless fight for survival as everything in this mesmerizing but deadly environment wants to eat you.<br /><br />The vivid world of Feist is brought to life by a highly dynamic and emergent gameplay. All elements interact with each other and produce unpredictable interactions. Enemies are armed with a complex AI and chase the player with the physical intensity of wild beasts – reminding him of how small he is.<br /><br />Feist's tension is emphasized by an enchanting and melancholic Score and a cinematic style reminiscent of Jim Henson's 'The Dark Cristal' (1982), Yuriy Norshteyn's 'Hedgehog in the Fog'. (1975) and Maurice Sendaks 'Where the Wild Things Are' (1963).<br /><br />(c) Bits & Beasts",

City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

        "description": "Make friends, play cards, twist the rules, become a Mega Mutant Power Pets master, and try to save the world in this single-player RPG about being a 90's kid. On her first day at Dudsdale Elementary, 10-year old Jess accidentally gets everybody's favorite collectible card game banned, forcing the kids to take their card battles underground. Troubles arise when mutants from the game invade the real world, and it's up to Jess and friends to stop them.<br /><br />From the award-winning indie game studio, Gambrinous, creators of Guild of Dungeoneering, comes an RPG where battles are played with an epic collectible card game. Cardpocalypse takes you back to the 1990's, a time when computers used floppy disks, and people read magazines for video game cheat codes. You will explore Dudsdale Elementary on a mission to build killer card decks in an effort to defeat the mutants. You will have to trade, earn, wager, change rules and permanently alter cards on your way to victory.<br /><br />• BE A CHAMPION: Build your decks around the ultra rare Champion cards you earn. Each Champion comes with unique abilities to tailor your deck around. First player to get their opponent's Champion card's health to zero wins the match.<br />• GO MEGA: Champion cards evolve to their MEGA forms when their health halves, doing more attack damage and gaining new powers.<br />• CHANGE THE GAME: The kids sometimes use house rules and who knows what the Mutants will change. Throughout the game you will choose the new rules and conditions as well as renaming your favorite cards and giving them upgrades using stickers. Create entirely new cards using the Mega Mutant Power Magazine. But be careful, these decisions are permanent.<br />• GET SCRAPPY: Adventure throughout the school to unravel the strange occurrences at Dudsdale Elementary. Take on quests to earn cards, stickers, and candy which you can collect and trade with your classmates. Careful, there's no backsies!<br />• YOU CAN'T COLLECT 'EM ALL: In the end, your decks and rules will be unique to you. Stickers are rare, choices matter, and sometimes you'll have to make a tough decision to get the best cards.<br />• THE 1990's: Through its totally rad, choice-driven, interactive narrative, Cardpocalypse delivers the experience of being a 90's kid. Boo-ya!<br />• Now featuring Gauntlet Mode! A roguelike mode where every run is unique. Pick your champion and fight your way through ever more difficult battles. After every win draft new cards, rules and rewards for your deck! Can you build the ultimate combo and beat the Gauntlet?",

Explore 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 rooms of randomly generated hazards and enemies in a retro adventure!<br /><br />Countless heroes have tried and failed to destroy the ancient spell that holds the castle walls. Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside, guarding the sword shards — the last known thing to be capable of defeating the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure.<br /><br />Although you are not alone — some help could be obtained from the merchants, who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them to disappear...<br /><br />Plan your every step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option. There are two difficulty modes: PAL/NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch.<br /><br />Just like in old NES games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found…<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />- Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming.<br />- Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock.<br />- Randomly generated castle, 216 rooms to overcome.<br />- Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

However, the “original game soundtrack selections” are playable on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.<br /><br />DEATHLOOP is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />Deluxe Edition Content: <br />• Unique Weapon: Transtar Trencher (PS5 Exclusive)<br />• Unique Weapon: Eat The Rich Tribunal<br />• Unique Weapon: .44 Karat Fourpounder<br />• Character Skin: \"Party Crasher\" Colt <br />• Character Skin: \"Sharp Shooter\" Julianna <br />• Two Trinkets (equippable buffs)<br />• Original Game Soundtrack Selections (*FORMATTED USB STORAGE DEVICE REQUIRED TO ACCESS AND PLAY SOUNDTRACK)<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane's unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you'll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you'll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You'll experience DEATHLOOP's main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you'll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you're feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna's stylish sneakers and invade another player's campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    <br />Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.",

Following the arrest of a prominent community leader, New York stands in disarray. Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as ‘Shard' spreads throughout the underworld. With the city's future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city's fate.<br /><br />Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to die… unless you decide they must.<br /><br />Key Features:<br />Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it's sneaking through levels or attacking head-on<br />Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle<br />A reactive story where the player's choices have real consequences<br />Stylized pixel art environments and characters<br />Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them. Tackle encounters in lethal, high-octane combat, or use your wits to stick to the shadows, utilizing distraction techniques and non-lethal attacks to reach your objective.<br /><br />Augmentation:<br />Unlock cybernetic upgrades to augment your abilities via upgrade trees, and build upon your playstyle to improve your stealth or increase the lethality of attacks through talent trees. Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground.<br /><br />Reactive Story:<br />Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld. Crush entire factions or convince them to aid your cause. Your destiny is yours to write.<br /><br />The World:<br />The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America's cities.<br /><br />These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Revealing the restless events of Site 113 and its struggle to construct the generator before the freezing veil shrouds the Earth, this prequel expansion broadens the Frostpunk universe by introducing a new environment, new Books of Laws and unique technologies, and presents a range of new buildings — all of which let you shape society and the city in unconventional ways.<br />• On The Edge expansion tells a story of citizens of New London sent for a special assignment after the Great Storm. It not only opens a brand new chapter set in the Frostpunk universe but also pits you against new challenges and offers unique mechanics, both in the city and on the Frostland map - further enriching the core experience.<br />• The Rifts allows you to experience a new level of challenge on a brand new Endless Mode map, where the land itself threatens your survival. Using a new gameplay mechanic, bridge the rifts to access new areas. Expand the city to save your people from the inevitable doom!<br /><br />ABOUT THE GAME<br /><br />Frostpunk is a blend of city-builder, society survival and a strategy game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive.<br />Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler's time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and the present state.<br />What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?",

Over five alternating turns taking place in a 25” time-loop, you are called to master the unique abilities of a varied cast of deep-space operatives and outskill, outsmart, and outmanoeuvre your opponent in mind-bending, four-dimensional battles.<br /><br />KEY FEATURES<br /><br />THINK DIFFERENTLY<br />Matches in Lemnis Gate take place within time loops. You have 25 seconds to execute your action, be it blasting an enemy, manoeuvring your operative, or setting up your next move. After all players have taken turns, the next 25-second round begins. Now you'll face what has happened while setting up what will happen. Each of the five rounds is your chance to alter the timeline as past, present, and future converge.<br /><br />A TIME-BENDING TACTICAL SHOOTER<br />With a varied cast of characters to choose from, how you play is up to you. Lay damaging toxic waste in your enemy's path, slow time to land the perfect shot, or deploy protective orbs to assist your future self. Every operative possesses a distinctive loadout and special ability that proves decisive on the battlefield.<br /><br />TEAM UP WITH YOURSELF<br />Welcome to the team comprised entirely of one: you. With Lemnis Gate's innovative auto co-op feature, you command every member of your side. Auto co-op gives you total control of five deep-space operatives, effectively enabling two competitors to duke it out in bustling ten-character matches. Become a literal one-person army.<br /><br />COUNTLESS POSSIBILITIES, ENDLESS OUTCOMES<br />From the first second to the last, anything can happen in Lemnis Gate. Each round is a fresh chance to implement an unbeatable new strategy – or earn redemption from an earlier error. Predict hostiles' routes, infiltrate enemy lines, and develop multi-layered gameplans by co-operating with yourself. Experiment both in and outside time, and get creative with causality.<br /><br />A HOST OF MODES AND MATCHTYPES<br />Create a match to your preference. Pick between a 1v1 and 2v2 contest, online or offline. Select your mode amongst three thrilling spins on established genre staples. There's Retrieve XM, in which you scramble to collect exotic matter and return it to your gate; Domination, which is about competing to capture zones; and Seek & Destroy, where you attempt to wreck your opponent's Resistors. Whether teaming up with a friend for \"hotseat\" local multiplayer, or pitting your operatives against online rivals, Lemnis Gate lets you set the board to suit your style.",

Your job is to cooperate, cook together and serve orders of steaming, delicious food. Chop, stir and fry everything you can while throwing (at) your partner all the ingredients they need. Prove that cooking is a piece of cake as long as you do it together!<br /><br />Features<br />- Everybody can have a taste. The game can be enjoyed by kids, teenagers, adults, and elders alike. Make cooking THE opportunity to forge new bonds and refine existing ones.<br />- Use your noodle. To complete orders as efficiently as possible, rely on your planning and communication skills; reflex and agility are considered a side dish in this kitchen.<br />- Fresh challenges everyday. Each level brings new ingredients, appliances and recipes to the table, raising the difficulty level bit-by-bit. <br />- Different foods call for different measures. Earn stars to progress through the game. Unlock new restaurants, upgrade your cooking gear to meet ever-changing cooking standards, and gain access to new character skins. <br />- Never overeat on fun. Once you feel like you have no more room for cooperation, try alternative game modes, including “Battle” and “Endless”.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity's last line of defense.<br /><br />Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF.

        "description": "Super Meat Boy Forever takes place a few years after the events of Super Meat Boy. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.<br /><br />The challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.<br /><br />What's better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We've handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.<br /><br />They don't give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they'll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won't happen but marketing text is hard to write.",

Arriving with only the clothes on your back, you must survive the colossal dangers that you encounter. To restore balance and reclaim the land from the brink, you will be faced with questions that not even a God knows the answer to.<br /><br />Scale Massive Beasts<br />-------------------------------<br />Overcome impossible odds to climb atop and defeat the massive beasts that are bound to this land.<br /><br />Climb, Glide, Swim<br />-------------------------------<br />You can climb on virtually anything you can get your hands on, from ruins and mountains to the massive beasts that inhabit the land. Ascend to the tops of mountains and then glide over the open world to reach previously inaccessible locations. Swim in frigid water to uncover hidden locations that contain secrets and treasure, but don't stay in too long or your swim could become your last.<br /><br />Explore, Craft, and Survive<br />-------------------------------<br />You'll arrive on a frozen island with only the clothes on your back -- it's up to you to survive. Make fires, hunt for food, and find the equipment you need to make it through an eternal winter. Nature isn't the only danger, so craft weapons, defeat minions for better gear, and venture into long forgotten caves to discover their secrets. Triumphing over these trials will prepare you for the impossible odds that wait.<br /><br />Make Your Path<br />-------------------------------<br />Praey for the Gods is a non-linear game where you choose who you battle and how. The large beasts can be attempted in any order allowing you to set the course.<br /><br />Unravel the Mystery<br />-------------------------------<br />Why won't the winter stop? Why has no one returned? Cryptic paintings left behind allude to a story once thought forgotten. To restore balance and reclaim the land, you will be faced with questions that not even the gods know the answer to.<br /><br />A Beautifully Frigid World<br />-------------------------------<br />Explore a landscape of unending winter framed by snow-capped peaks and crawling fog. The remnants of an ancient civilization lie before you, but don't let awe turn into carelessness -- snow storms can crop up at any moment and bury you in a blizzard. Luckily, you can leave footprints in the snow and follow your footsteps back if you are lost.",

        "description": "Reprise your role as Van Helsing, the fearless monster hunter, the star of this unique action-RPG set in an alternative Gothic-noir Europe (although we really shouldn't ignore his charming, but deadly ghost companion, Lady Katarina).<br /><br />In Borgovia, the war is over, but the future looks grim. The city of weird science is in ruins, squabbling factions and criminals fight for power and a strange cult prophesizes the coming of “the end times.” And they might be just right: a wave of uncanny events shakes the land, and it's all connected to a mysterious creature, a former ally turned into a fearful arch-villain. Which means that Van Helsing will do what he does best: he grabs his weapons, prepares his deadly tricks, and hunts down the most dangerous monster who has ever lived… and this time it's personal. He's prepared to do anything to achieve his goal, even to face the darkest secret about the birth of the modern Borgovia.",

Whilst the aim of the game is simply to escape, the detail is in the execution. (Don't say the word execution too loud in a prison). You may not be in an open prison, but you are in an open world where in between attending rollcalls, mealtimes and doing your chores you should grab every chance to plan your escape. Do you do favors for other inmates earning money and boosting their opinion of you along the way? Or workout and become stronger? Read to increase your skills or spend your time crafting items into homemade weapons and tools. What about working diligently in your prison job, to gain promotions to new jobs with better benefits? Keep a low profile or go out all guns blazing, as long as you escape in the end, that's all that matters.<br /><br />The Escapists developed by Mouldy Toof Studios & Team17 Digital  © 2015.

One of them features little minigames!<br />•\tUnlock the 50 super-unique achievements!<br />•\tFill the Mayo album with the 50 ultra rare, 1950's inspired, collectable cards!<br />•\tPointlessly compete with your friends and the world with the online “clicks” leaderboards!<br /><br />Frequently Asked Questions<br />Q: Wait a minute... Is this a sequel to My Name is Mayo?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: Why would you do such a thing??<br />A: Isolation in 2020 has been interesting to say the least. Also we couldn't resist peer pressure.<br /><br />Q: Well, is it a Next-Gen leap for the franchise?<br />A: Huh? Franchise? Well, the graphics are 1080p, 60fps. 1950's graphic-art inspired. Only the best!<br /><br />Q: Is it better than the original?<br />A: ... Define “better”...<br /><br />Q: Good lord, what does the game even have?<br />A: More of the stuff from the first game! 4 new stories to follow along; 10 more crazy facts to discover; some weird minigames sprinkled throughout; and one messed-up Mayo.<br /><br />Q: Are there at least achievements or something?<br />A: Yup! 50 of them in fact, laid out in a nice card album for you to collect!<br /><br />Q: What's the gameplay like? Is it still a clicker?<br />A: Yup. Click the Mayo jar and the gameplay will “click” with you right away! “Tap” into the psyche of Mayo and “Mouse-y” along the quirky stories!<br /><br />Q: Please no more puns...<br />A: I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave... (We hope one of you is named Dave)",

You'll need to explore, hunt for supplies, uncover clues, and fight your way through each anomaly – each consisting of semi-procedurally generated instances where both the environment, and the undead, are out to kill you!<br /><br />Immediately after the events of Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles, you find yourself trapped within the remains of Arzt Memorial Hospital – the hub to organize your inventory and storage cache, level up your character, or just to take a breather before venturing back out into the chaos. There's more to discover in the world besides murderous hordes of the undead – find the journals scattered about to learn more about the outbreak and ultimately where to find refuge! Don't think death can save you – every time you die, you'll awake trapped in this nexus.<br /><br />Outbreak: Endless Nightmares focuses on extreme replayability by offering multiple character options – each with their own abilities, upgrade paths and more! Each time you venture into the anomaly, it'll change and become increasingly difficult as you grow in power. You'll need to think carefully about what weapons, healing items, and other supplies you'll bring along. If you're lucky, you may find storage caches that give you access to your expanded inventory, and offer an opportunity to restock. But it's all on you to search your environment for supplies. If you run out ... your fate is sealed!<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above. Since then, psionics have been scouted for their talents and recruited to the Other Suppression Force (OSF), humanity's last line of defense.<br /><br />Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF. As their different experiences interweave with each other, it is only then that you will reveal the full story and unlock all the mysteries of a Brain Punk future caught between technology and psychic abilities in SCARLET NEXUS.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat.

But who is he, really?<br /><br />A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult.<br /><br />Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice.

It's been months since you last saw Theo, and she's incredibly excited to spend the weekend together.<br /><br />She invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just the get-together that you need to reconnect.<br /><br />Everything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he's bringing along an uninvited guest.<br /><br />Although Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's about the only thing you share in common...<br /><br />Will you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star?<br /><br />The Cast:<br /><br />Theo is your childhood friend. Although initially shy with strangers, Theo has a great sense of humour and loves to joke around with her friends. She prefers to have a tight-knit group and doesn't open up to just anyone. She studies photography at the same college as her roommate Lena and loves spending time with her. Theo won a draw for a cottage getaway in the town of Seaside and is your host for the weekend.<br /><br />Lena is Theo's roommate... and replacement best friend. You don't know much about her, or even what she's studying. From what you've seen on Friendex, Lena is a vibrant and outgoing person. She's always dyeing her hair different colours and wearing cute clothes. According to her online bio, in her spare time she enjoys hiking and playing piano.<br /><br />Alec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both have similar hobbies like gaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally, renting a student house with Alec seemed like a great idea... until he started dating. He jumps from girl to girl, never committing despite constantly whining that he wants a serious relationship. His latest date, Erika, tagged along to the cottage without an invitation. Lately, Alec has been annoying you... more than usual.<br /><br />A year younger than you, Erika is from the same hometown. You don't remember much about her, or ever talking to her...",

        "description": "STRIDE is a high-octane parkour adventure in virtual reality. Fight for your life as you hurtle through the canopy of a futuristic metropolis. Step into the shoes of a master freerunner as you vault, swing, roll, and shoot your way through this intense, action-packed adventure. Will you survive the ultimate freerun?<br /><br />Experience the rush of parkour<br /><br />Navigate city rooftops like a parkour pro. Grab ledges, jump from roof to roof, vault through windows, slide down cables, swing from hooks: your possibilities are limited only by your attentiveness, creativity, and reactive skill.<br /><br />Designed for virtual reality, you'll feel the rush of leaping across impossibly wide gaps over dizzying heights. Don't look down!<br /><br />Fight for your life at 1,000ft<br /><br />Once you're a parkour pro, it's time to turn up the heat. Turn on enemies, and the city will be crawling with snipers who want you dead. To survive, you'll need to combine fast-paced parkour moves with strategic dodges as bullets fly your way.<br /><br />You're not defenseless - equip your own weapon and experience the satisfaction of picking off a sniper mid-air, nailing your landing on the edge of a skyscraper, then flowing straight into a wall-run to line up your next target!<br /><br />Of course, if the enemies are too much to handle, you can always disable them and focus on pure parkour.<br /><br />ARCADE MODES<br /><br />Endless mode<br /><br />Infinite level generation provides unlimited challenging terrain. Build your score by landing jumps over impossibly wide gaps, nailing insane wall-runs, sliding under barriers, and swinging between buildings. There's no turning back or time to stop - as the world quickly falls apart behind you. Oh, and did we mention the rooftops are crawling with snipers? Pull out your 9mm mid-air and pick them off as you glide across the gap between buildings.<br /><br />Time Run Mode<br /><br />Compete for the top spot on the leaderboard. In Time Run mode, it's all about speed. As the terrain unveils itself ahead of you, you'll need to visualize your route on the fly, and execute each move with precision.<br /><br />Arena Mode<br /><br />In Arena mode, you're presented with a spacious section of the city's rooftops, without the pressure of a creeping barrier coming up behind you. You have complete freedom of movement within this complex high-rise “arena” but you'll be challenged with a variety of tasks. Examples include finding and collecting certain items , completing a specified route within a time limit, stealing an item without getting spotted by the snipers, or - simply - killing all the enemies! Arena mode feels even more like a real city, so enjoy the views… but try not to die.<br /><br />In addition, on PS5 consoles: PlayStation Camera adaptor for PS Camera is required (no purchase necessary) go to Playstation.com/camera-adaptor.<br /><br />PlayStation Camera required<br />2 PlayStation Move motion controllers required<br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Stereoscopic 3D Game",

We're saved!\"<br /><br />It's not easy delivering pizzas for a living. My boss is a jerk, my co-workers all think I'm super-old because I'm in my 20s, and the customers...well, let's say they can be rather, umm, zesty. Like the person who doesn't know their own address. Or the guy on 12th Avenue who answers the door wearing nothing but a smile. I don't care how many abs you have, dude; that's not okay!<br /><br />So when a scruffy-looking guy shows up, claiming to be me from the future? Yeah, it's easy to just brush him off. ...Until it isn't, and I'm being hunted down by an organization with an unhealthy fixation on cat experimentation. But we'll get to that. For now, rest assured: your pizza IS on its way—and it's coming with a side order of righteousness!<br /><br />- Doug Rivers<br /><br />It's The Pizza Delivery Boy Who Saved the World! A brand-new visual novel by a former delivery boy who is probably never going to work in the pizza industry again, if his boss finds out he made this game.",

        "description": "theHunter: Call of the Wild Diamond Bundle lets you dive into a hunting experience like no other, containing the base game, 4 reserves, 3 weapon packs, 3 equipment packs and 2 trophy lodges. Plunge into an atmospheric open world, teeming with life: from the majestic true-to-life animals to the rustling of leaves above you as you stalk your prey. You can decide to hunt on your own or join up and hunt together with friends. Just remember, you are not just a visitor in this world, you are a living and breathing part of it. As you finally spot the majestic crown of your first red deer through the brush, the feeling is indescribable.<br /><br />EXPLORE RESERVES ACROSS THE WORLD<br />In the Diamond Bundle, you will be able to visit hunting grounds across the globe. Trek through the lavender fields of Parque Fernando, explore the lush snow covered landscape of Yukon Valley, traverse the regal foliage of Cuatro Colinas, or scale past the cloudline in the mountainous Silver Ridge Peaks. In these diverse reserves, you will be able to hunt animals of all shapes and sizes, from grizzly bears and wolves to turkeys, bighorn sheep, ibexes, and pumas. And that only scratches the surface of what these 4 regions have to offer.<br /><br />BRING THE PERFECT EQUIPMENT<br />When tracking your target, you need to bring the best possible equipment for the task, and Diamond Bundle has you covered. Including 5 weapon and equipment packs, you will be able to prepare yourself for any hunting situation. Bring the drilling rifle along for versatility, the MN1890 or M1 for reliability, or the Muzzleloader for that old-time explosive shot. Or if you want to set up the perfect hiding spot to take down your target, utilize the treestands and tripods for maximum visibility.<br /><br />SHOWCASING YOUR TROPHIES<br />What better way to celebrate a successful hunt than showcasing your trophies in one of the two lodges included in the Diamond Bundle. Decorate the walls and rooms in both the spacious 1800 British Mansion and more modern safari lodge with your prized kills, creating a visual representation and journey of your best hunting moments. Or simply use the multi trophy mounts to pose multiple animals and create a visually climactic moment involving your favourite trophies. Invite your friends to your lodge at any time and share your evolving collection.",

        "description": "Xuan Yuan Sword 7 is an action RPG with frenetic real-time combat, visceral 3D presentation and a rich cinematic narrative. It is a celebration of ancient China's landscape, civilization and culture, infused with the mystique of its own legends in stark contrast to anachronistic technological designs. It is a world that is both familiar and mysterious, one of both science and spirituality, one that is waiting to be explored.<br /><br />Take the role of the calm and reliable swordsman Taishi Zhao as he fights to protect his family and uncover the truth of a blight threatens all of China. With a story deeply rooted in ancient Chinese history and mythology, Xuan Yuan Sword 7 reimagines both as one fantastical and chaotic realm under the governance of a new Xin Dynasty.<br /><br />Near the end of Western Han rule, the powerful prime minister of China superseded his Emperor, promising an era of peace and prosperity. But ten years later, that promise has never been fulfilled. Instead, a decade of war and famine has left China in ruin, and its salvation seems to lie in the hands of a Mohist swordsman who gains control of a fabled artifact called the Elysium Scroll. Can the science-seeking Mohists revive their former glory, or will they fade into the pages of forgotten history?<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Journey across ancient China as a cinematic adventure unfolds.<br />• Slash, block, dodge and riposte in combo-based real-time combat!<br />• Control the Elysium Scroll to slow down time, absorb monsters or alter the environment.<br />• Upgrade armor and weapons, develop passive skills and learn new techniques.<br />• Explore a standalone story requiring no prior knowledge of Xuan Yuan.<br />• Immerse yourself in the most advanced 3D visuals in series history!<br /><br />Offline play enabled",
