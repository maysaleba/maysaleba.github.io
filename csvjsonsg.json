Start each action-packed stage with a silhouetted girl behind the playfield and dodge enemies while drawing lines that cut away when connected, methodically uncovering the image underneath.<br /><br />It's a game of risk-vs-reward as you capture as much of the playfield as possible without enemies or bullets crossing your path. Will you whittle away at smaller and safer zones along the edge, or will you go for higher scores by cutting into enemy territory? Box in power-ups to use their effects, unlock completed images in the gallery and share your victories across online leaderboards!<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Rescue anime-style mecha girls in 50 unique stages!<br />• Decide your own strategy in freeform gameplay.<br />• Adapt to gradually increasing difficulty.<br />• Unlock special 5-star challenges with the girls in alternate outfits!<br />• View your captured images in Gallery mode.<br />• Enjoy a pumping soundtrack that will get you in the mood.<br />• Share high scores with online leaderboards!<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

When a small rebel group gets an intel about a big AI's power plant, the machines strike their camp before they can organize an attack. A small group of rebels escape and go in a suicide mission to destroy this power plant. Choose to play as Mavra, a super badass human resistance soldier, or Doyle, the equally groovy and deadly insurgent robot. This suicide mission will result in heavy casualties and a ton of lock-and-load fast-paced action where scraping robots and blazing chrome with your powerful weapons is the only thing standing between you and your freedom. Dash through 5 apocalyptic environments with hundred of robots-enemies to blow to pieces. Blast your way through the enemy lines and and try to defeat a bunch of mechanical bosses with using hoverbikes, huge armors and a whole arsenal of kick-ass weapons.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

The multiple-scenario structure of the previous title returns with an epic new story supervised by IGA (Koji Igarashi) himself.<br /><br />Players take control of Zangetsu, a swordsman from the far east who bears a deep grudge against demonkind and the alchemists who summoned them. Zangetsu must battle his way to the demonic stronghold, but he doesn't have to do it alone! Zangetsu can ally himself with a brand new cast of characters he meets along the way and add them to the playable roster.<br /><br />Three brand-new playable characters appear in Curse of the Moon 2, including the exorcist Dominique. All characters from the original Curse of the Moon game are playable, too! Each new character adds a variety of gameplay options, abilities, and ways to complete the games' many stages.<br /><br />Players can also create demon hunting duos in 2-player local co-op, available for the first time in the series! Work together with a friend, mix and match the strengths of two different characters, and conquer stages in tons of new and exciting ways.<br /><br />PS4 game can be controlled via PS Vita<br />Offline play enabled<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

        "Desc": "Old Pete, “The Dock Yard”, is being demolished. He's the first of his group of friends to go. It was unexpected and everyone is a bit worried.<br /><br />Being made of bricks and mortar doesn't mean you don't have your own things to worry about.<br /><br />This ragtag group of friends were there, right from the start, when it really became a city. With them they brought the titans of the industry, hundreds of jobs, and hundreds more houses. But the Linen Mill's not been getting many textile orders come through this year, the Warehouse lost another contract from the neighbouring city and the Old Bank's having money troubles.<br /><br />Something's not quite right. Change is coming. What if they're next?<br /><br />Fortunately, you, The Halfway Hotel, are at hand to step in and reassure everyone that things will be ok. But what starts off as small odd jobs ends up unravelling into more problems, as history moves faster than you can keep up with.<br /><br />Buildings Have Feelings Too! is an exciting new city management game about buildings and the city they inhabit.<br /><br />Imagine a city where buildings can walk and talk to one another. Each one has its own aspirations, hopes and fears. Most of the time they are just trying to get along with each other and make it through the day. Grow your city into a bustling metropolitan centre with an array of shops, offices, entertainment facilities and amenities, to help your buildings thrive; or risk them being demolished forever.<br /><br />- Discover and equip a wide range of businesses from the Victorian era right through to the modern day.<br /><br />- Befriend a range of Buildings, each with their own aspirations, hopes and fears, as they come to grips with the changing world around them.<br /><br />- Customise and rearrange your city's layout by moving buildings and find the perfect combination for your city to grow.<br /><br />- Expand across multiple neighbourhoods of your city, discovering new landmark characters and districts.",

We here at Bend Studio recommend playing through the story mode before viewing the art book.<br /><br />Days Gone is an open-world action-adventure game set in a harsh wilderness two years after a devastating global pandemic. Play as Deacon St. John, a drifter and bounty hunter who rides the broken road, fighting to survive while searching for a reason to live. <br />•Harsh Open World: Using the power of PlayStation4 and Unreal Engine 4, Days Gone offers an incredibly realistic and detailed open-world experience. Immerse yourself in vast and hostile environments, and explore their secrets. Search abandoned vehicles, houses, truck stops and towns as you scavenge for resources. But be careful— day and night cycles, along with dynamic weather systems, all affect gameplay and enemy behavior. <br />•Brutal Sandbox Combat: Perfect your gameplay with an endless combination of strategy and play in every situation. Craft customized items using pieces and parts found in the field, from brutal melee weapons to traps and more. Act wisely, as every choice can be the difference between life and death.<br />•Unique Enemies: In addition to human drifters, marauders and militia, Deacon must face a wilderness overrun by Freakers— mindless, feral creatures. Although more animal than human, Freakers are smart and quickly evolving. As with any living creature, they have needs, habits, and behaviors that Deacon must learn and adjust to. <br />•Unique Setting: Adapt to quick environmental changes inspired by the harsh high-desert of the Pacific Northwest. One minute, Deacon is riding through a dense alpine forest—or snow field or lush meadow— and the next, he's fighting his way through harsh desert lava fields and caves. Ancient lava flows scar and define the hazardous environments, delivering a breathtaking and diverse backdrop of regions to explore. From small towns and mountains to cliffs and river basins, explore the beautiful but threatening world, left in the wake of humanity's destruction.<br />•Compelling Story: At its core, Days Gone is about survivors and what makes them human: desperation, loss, madness, betrayal, friendship, brotherhood, regret, love— and hope. It's about how, even when confronted with such enormous tragedy, hope never dies.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.<br />  WARNING: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS MATERIAL WHICH MAY OFFEND AND MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED, CIRCULATED, SOLD, HIRED, GIVEN, LENT, SHOWN, PLAYED OR PROJECTED TO A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS",

Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who've faced its trials and tribulations before can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance.<br /><br />In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant, channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One. <br />With the summoning of The Old One, a colourless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them lost their minds — left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained.<br /><br />Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title \"Slayer of Demons\" and send The Old One back to its slumber.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

You play as BK, a hole-driving raccoon who swallows up his friends and their homes to earn idiotic prizes.<br /><br />When BK falls into one of his own holes, he's confronted by his best friend Mira and the residents of Donut County, who are all stuck 999 feet underground… and they demand answers!<br /><br />The Hole Keeps Growing<br />• EXPLORE every character's home, each with their own unique environment.<br />• MOVE the hole to swallow up their stuff, growing bigger each time.<br />• COMBINE objects inside for crazy effects: cook soup, breed bunnies, launch fireworks, and more.<br />• CATAPULT things back out of the hole. You can use it to solve puzzles...or just destroy stuff.<br />• DEVOUR everything. The hole won't stop until the whole county is all gone.<br /><br />Donut County was created by Ben Esposito, designer on What Remains of Edith Finch and The Unfinished Swan. It is the result of six years of solo development, dozens of donuts (for research), and one fateful encounter with a raccoon.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

        "Desc": "To play this game on PS5, your system may need to be updated to the latest system software. Although this game is playable on PS5, some features available on PS4 may be absent. See PlayStation.com/bc for more details.<br />Dragon Marked For Death is a side-scrolling 2D action RPG that can played solo or with up to four players in local or online multiplayer.<br /><br />You play as the survivors of the Dragonblood Clan who set out to take revenge on the Kingdom of Medius, who destroyed their home and captured the Dragonblood Oracle, Amica. To obtain the power they need to enact their revenge, they forge a pact with the Astral Dragon Atruum.<br /><br />Use your newly acquired powers to take on quests from villagers and raise your status in the kingdom. How you perform in these quests can have a direct effect on the game's final outcome.<br /><br />Quests aren't all about defeating enemies, though.

Now the once peaceful kingdom of Fahrul is in chaos.<br /><br />With nowhere left to turn and stretched beyond her means, the queen has put out a desperate plea to the citizens of the land to rise up and help stem the tide of impending doom. Set off with your make-shift party, either single player, local, or online co-op. Choose to split your party up and cover more ground, or stick together for protection. A sound strategy can mean the difference between life and death.<br /><br />For The King is a challenging blend of Strategy, JRPG Combat, and Roguelike elements. Each play through is made unique with procedural maps, quests, and events. Brave the relentless elements, fight the wicked creatures, sail the seas and delve into the dark underworld. None before you have returned from their journey. Will you be the one to put an end to the Chaos?<br /><br />Fight and die as a party in fast paced and brutal turn-based combat using a unique slot system for attacks and special abilities. Find and gather herbs for your trusty pipe to heal your wounds and cure your maladies. Set up safe camps or brave the horrors that nightfall brings.<br /><br />Just remember adventurer, you do this not for the riches or fame but for your village, for your realm, For The King!<br /><br />Includes:<br />- Dungeon Crawl Adventure<br />- Frost Adventure Adventure<br />- Gold Rush Un-cooperative Mode<br />- Hildebrants Cellar Adventure<br />- Into The Deep Adventure<br /><br />For The King & © IronOak Games.

Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.<br /><br />• Bold New Beginning — His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. <br />• A Second Chance — Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.<br />• A Darker, More Elemental World — From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War's breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise.<br />• Vicious, Physical Combat — With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.<br />  WARNING: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS MATERIAL WHICH MAY OFFEND AND MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED, CIRCULATED, SOLD, HIRED, GIVEN, LENT, SHOWN, PLAYED OR PROJECTED TO A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS",

        "Desc": "Just Die Already is an old people mayhem sandbox game created by the designers of Goat Simulator.<br /><br />You are an old retired person in a near future where people aren't having any children. There isn't anyone to pay for pensions due to those ungrateful millennials who prefer playing video games instead of doing actual work. With no one to cover your living costs, you - just like all other old people in this world - have no other choice but to survive on your own. <br />How will you survive in a world that wants you to Just Die Already?<br /><br />To make things worse, you've just been kicked out of your retirement home, and your only option now is to perform dangerous challenges and explore the world for retirement tickets to qualify for free retirement care. <br />So with society wishing you dead, isn't it finally time to live a little?<br /><br />FREE POST-LAUNCH PVP MODES – AVAILABLE NOW<br /><br />Give the boomers what they deserve by having them fight for their lives! Compete against your other old friends with this new free Player Versus Player update.<br />Play in 4 new arenas, customize your game modes and start ripping each other's limbs off. <br />Brace yourself up to your nipples in your old man pants, this Old Vs Old mayhem competition is ON!<br /><br />KEY FEATURES:<br /><br />BE OLD, BE BOLD<br />You get to be an old person. Angry, fragile, poor and hating the world: the dream you didn't know you had until now. Finally, you have found something in common with your grandparents.<br /><br />BREAK A LEG... BREAK A NECK<br />Discover the joys of being old and made of glass, anything can break you and you can break your everything.<br /><br />DON'T TRY THIS AT (RETIREMENT) HOME<br />Complete dangerous challenges that you will never ever try at home and answer existential questions like: can you launch yourself from a catapult and land on someone? Or, can you survive losing your head, grabbing it and whacking someone with it?<br /><br />ONE MISSION: RETIRE!<br />Earn rewards by completing dangerous challenges, your goal? To qualify for a proper retirement home. That makes perfect sense. Word of advice: try and stay in one piece so you can enjoy it in the end…<br /><br />SANDBOX MULTIPLAYER<br />Play alone, or with up to 4 players in online multiplayer. Complete challenges together, or just cause mayhem and rip your friends' limbs off!<br /><br />BE OLD. TWICE.<br />You get to be an old person. So good we said it twice.<br /><br />LIMITLESS INTERACTION<br />Pick up and interact with a very wide variety of objects. Everything from giant trouts, trampolines, guns, electrical wiring, and fireworks, just to mention a few. Bazookas, axes, trombones, air horns and jetpacks to mention a few more. Yes they all can be used to hurt and maim.<br /><br />EMBRACE YOUR INNER BOOMER<br />Wreak havoc on the millennial and zoomer population (we forgot Generation X, just like everyone else). NPCs react differently depending on their age - some will laugh and clap at others getting hurt while others will run away in terror.<br /><br />THE GAME CAN BE AS CRAZY AS YOU<br />The city is filled with detailed environments, loaded with secrets and hidden paths, that encourage detailed exploration and quirky experimentation to truly see it all.<br /><br />OLD. PERSON.<br />Okay that's the last time we promise.",

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.<br /><br />KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.<br /><br />Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes,\" which were originally published separately, available now on PlayStation 4 for the first time.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

MAQUETTE makes it possible by twisting the world into itself recursively in an MC Escher-esque fashion.<br /><br />Head to the center of the world and you'll feel like a giant, towering over buildings and walls. But venture further out, and start to feel small as things get larger and larger - to the point where cracks in the ground become chasms.<br /><br />In Maquette you will explore the scales of everyday [problems in a modern-day love story.  Where sometimes the smallest of issues can become insurmountable obstacles.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

To overcome these obstacles you must master the combat, as well as improve your character and gear through a wealth of elements such as Quests, Perks, Runes, Upgrades, and Looting.<br /><br />The Gahars have bound their twisted minds to the flesh of the Seven Acolytes, for without hosts they cannot survive. You must slay the Acolytes, thus ridding the Gahars of their flesh. Succeed, and you'll free the kingdom from the heavy yoke of their terror. Fail, and the malicious gods rule on, as the Acolytes rise anew, and madness prevails.<br /><br />-Experience epic, brutal boss encounters and explore a diverse array of environments <br />-Perk levelling system with multiple ways to build your character<br />-Deep, immersive lore with NPC's to meet throughout the world<br />-Health, Stamina and Sanity management is important as you traverse the world<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

This means each dungeon is unique and expandable, being tailored to your own specific playstyle.<br /><br />Unlimited Item Synergies<br />As you progress through each dungeon, random item drops will be key in helping you infiltrate the Abyss and these passive effects can stack between every item. With no limit to how many can apply; a wide variety of combinations will make each run unique.<br /><br />Hatch and Evolve Pets<br />If you need some company on your journey into the depths of the abyss, or just some additional firepower or assistance, eggs can be found which will turn into a random pet that has a special ability and will evolve the longer you survive.<br /><br />Mini-games<br />Take a short break from slaying minions and take part in random mini-games that will also bag you some loot! Jump into Piano Performances, Meditation Challenge, Dance Competitions, and more – staying alive just got a lot more interesting!<br /><br />Offline play enabled<br /><br />One-time licence fee to download to multiple PS4 systems.

Here we find two sisters who descend from a long line of expert swordsmen, yet were born to different mothers. The elder sister, Aya, was raised by her father, who subjected her to rigorous training in the way of the blade. Meanwhile, the younger sister, Saki, was raised by her mother, learning to despise her father for abandoning them and taking her sister away.<br />When her father goes missing, Aya decides to put her skills with the sword to use as an Undead-hunter. Upon her beloved mother's murder, Saki becomes consumed to the point of insanity with a desperate thirst for revenge, resorting to manipulating the Undead to achieve her goal.<br />Aya resolves to seek out her younger sister, her only surviving relation, while Saki is determined to resurrect her mother using an ancient art passed down through the ages. This art, however, requires the heart of a blood relative to work, meaning that the younger sister must kill the elder if she is to have her sworn vengeance.<br />And so, amidst a swirling storm of love, hate, and intrigue, the battle between the two sisters begins.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Internet connection and PlayStationPlus membership (sold separately) required.<br /><br />※This item is also offered in a pack.<br /><br />Predator: Hunting Grounds is an immersive asymmetrical multiplayer shooter set in the remote jungles of South America, where the Predator stalks the most challenging prey. Play as a member of an elite 4 person Fireteam and complete paramilitary operations before the Predator finds you. Or, play as the Predator to hunt the most worthy prey, choosing from your vast array of deadly alien tech to collect your trophies, one by one.<br /><br />Enter the World of Predator:<br />Enter a world that looks and feels completely authentic to the lore of the Predator universe. Pulling from the silver screen to your PlayStation4 system using the Unreal Engine, the lush jungle comes alive with the sights and sounds of military bravado moving toward their objective. While up in the trees, a flash of light and an omnious clicking sound belay that the team is about to face deadly opposition. From the epic Predator theme song to the signature light-bending cloaking and thermal Predator tech, fans of the Predator-verse will revel in both familiar and new canon.<br /><br />Human vs. Alien Weaponry:<br />As the military's best of the best, the Fireteam packs a state-of-the-art arsenal, from pistols and sidearms to assault rifles, shotguns, grenades and heavy weapons.** Each soldier can customize weapon loadouts.  Likewise, the Predator's tech loadout is unparalled with the shoulder-mounted Plasma Caster, Combistick, Smart Disc, Wrist Blades, Yaujta Longbow and more.<br /><br />Jungle Warfare:<br />The conflict zones of South America are treacherous, thick with ranging trees and sprawling undergrowth. Guerilla soldiers are well-camouflaged between guarding shantie hide-outs at the water's edge. Whether Fireteam moves as a unit or takes a strategic split approach to reach each objective, the rich setting offers a diverse environment to perfect your approach. For the Predator, the trees are perfect for using otherworldy skills, crawling up tree trunks and stealthing through branches to stalk prey with frightening speed.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Play as a member of an elite 4 person Fireteam and complete paramilitary operations before the Predator finds you. Or, play as the Predator to hunt the most worthy prey, choosing from your vast array of deadly alien tech to collect your trophies, one by one.<br /><br />Enter the World of Predator:<br />Enter a world that looks and feels completely authentic to the lore of the Predator universe. Pulling from the silver screen to your PlayStation4 system using the Unreal Engine, the lush jungle comes alive with the sights and sounds of military bravado moving toward their objective. While up in the trees, a flash of light and an omnious clicking sound belay that the team is about to face deadly opposition. From the epic Predator theme song to the signature light-bending cloaking and thermal Predator tech, fans of the Predator-verse will revel in both familiar and new canon.<br /><br />Human vs. Alien Weaponry:<br />As the military's best of the best, the Fireteam packs a state-of-the-art arsenal, from pistols and sidearms to assault rifles, shotguns, grenades and heavy weapons.** Each soldier can customize weapon loadouts.  Likewise, the Predator's tech loadout is unparalled with the shoulder-mounted Plasma Caster, Combistick, Smart Disc, Wrist Blades, Yaujta Longbow and more.<br /><br />Jungle Warfare:<br />The conflict zones of South America are treacherous, thick with ranging trees and sprawling undergrowth. Guerilla soldiers are well-camouflaged between guarding shantie hide-outs at the water's edge. Whether Fireteam moves as a unit or takes a strategic split approach to reach each objective, the rich setting offers a diverse environment to perfect your approach. For the Predator, the trees are perfect for using otherworldy skills, crawling up tree trunks and stealthing through branches to stalk prey with frightening speed.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.<br />  WARNING: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS MATERIAL WHICH MAY OFFEND AND MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED, CIRCULATED, SOLD, HIRED, GIVEN, LENT, SHOWN, PLAYED OR PROJECTED TO A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS",

These are your rules.<br /><br />Remastered and now Re-Enhanced for PlayStation5 cause chaos in Steelport at the highest performance, with improvements to lighting, shaders, texture resolution and other visual effects thanks to the powerful hardware.  Enjoy running amok at 60 frames per second with dynamic 4K resolution, keeping the action fluid.<br /><br />Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints have evolved from street gang to household brand name and kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.<br /><br />Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and fight against a highly-trained military force by your lonesome in the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.",

Their dynasty has been watching over Asposia for centuries on end. In secret, they fill the roly-poly world with light and life. But when their existence is discovered, they become hunted. Emil, a trader for odds and ends, made all the Asposians believe that the dynasty is in cahoots with dark forces. The only one who can stop the evil Emil is the heir to the throne: Robert. He has been petrified for three years, though. With a huge dose of enthusiasm, but little to no idea what he's actually doing, he embarks on an adventure to find the legendary last wind monk. Of course, he has some great company: Peck, as loyal as he is flightless, and Laura, a rebel who certainly does fly, but only off the handle - and who Robert loves, with a capital L. Everything changes, when they meet the mysterious Mama Dola, who seems to know more about Robert's destiny than Robert would like.",

Please look forward to the world of THE LAST REMNANT revived on PlayStation4.<br /><br />?Story<br />Mitra, yama, qsiti, sovani...<br />These four races exist in one world.<br />A world filled with Remnants — mysterious artifacts from an ancient era. <br />Who created the Remnant? How long ago? And for what purpose?<br />With these questions left unanswered, the Remnants became beneficial tools used for the good of civilization.<br />The world was at peace...or so it seemed. Who was to know such darkness lay in wait? <br />The powers of the Remnants slowly began to change the world's balance.<br />A rift slowly formed between those who ruled and those who obeyed.<br />This was the dawning of a new era — an era of countless frays that would be brought upon the world by those enslaved by their own lust for power. <br />A thousand years later, the journey of one young man begins.<br /><br />?Unique Battle System<br />Battle commands for ever changing battle situations. <br />The game introduces a symbol encounter system in which the battle starts by approaching enemies in the dungeon. Giving orders depending on situations according to the conditions of your allies and enemies is of vast importance. With the \"Morale\" system, which displays the strength and morale of each character during the fight, the outcome of the battle will greatly change. Increasing attack power or reducing damage taken will provide beneficial effects to the battle. Besides formations and critical triggers, there are also several other elements in the battle system for you to enjoy.<br /><br />?Additional Features<br />?Trophy and share function<br />?High speed moving function for Rush (protagonist) on the field<br />?Adjusted texture resolution and lighting via an update<br />?Changed menu font and facial graphics<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

On a quest to become the island's champion, you join forces with Sprites, creatures who are the only thing capable of dispersing the murk, to save Gemea and its people.<br /><br />The towns of Gemea are filled with kind-hearted residents who have faced many difficulties since the murk arrived. By contributing to the island through farming, crafting, cooking, fishing and brewing, relationships can be built with the locals, who offer everything from resources to a new farm as rewards.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

The game counts with a solid story which unfolds in a fantasy world populated by dozens of unorthodox characters. Adventuring, exploring ruins, accidentally unleashing the apocalypse, saving the world… you've done it all, and so has Argus. And, frankly, he's a bit fed up with the whole thing. He used to be a wizard, which was fine and all, but he's in his 30s now, and he wants to settle down, get some peace and quiet. But that's not easy to get with all those spike-haired buffoons dragging their giant swords around and ruining the pavement. Specially when you're trying to keep a dangerous artifact hidden from meddling heroes with a chosen one complex.<br /><br />Zenith ©2016 Infinigon.
