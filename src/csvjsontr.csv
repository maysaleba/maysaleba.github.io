"92","2024-07-03","From PlayStation Studios and Bluepoint Games comes a remake of the PlayStation classic, Demon's Souls. Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who've faced its trials and tribulations before can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance. In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant, channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One. With the summoning of The Old One, a colourless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them lost their minds — left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained. Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title ""Slayer of Demons"" and send The Old One back to its slumber.","2024-06-18","/game/2439","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202011/1717/GemRaOZaCMhGxQ9dRhnQQyT5.png?w=200","27","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP9000-PPSA01341_00-DEMONSSOULS00000","50%","74","Action","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/demons-souls/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","Demon's Souls","TRD","Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe","2020-11-11","demons-souls-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","619.00","41","309.50","0","",

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.","2024-06-18","/game/4956","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/0318/6e4c1a9bea5d06b549bdd4e0ed67c3ab9837c643da774614.png?w=200","8","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2333-PPSA15802_00-KRZPS5SIEE000000","60%","13","Adventure, Unique","219.6","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition","TRD","Annapurna Interactive","2023-08-17","kentucky-route-zero-tv-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","549.00","11","219.60","1","",

"72","2024-07-03","""El Hijo - A Wild West Tale"" is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a young boy on his quest to find his mother. As a six-year-old, “El Hijo” must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn’t feel right and he plans his escape. “El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Using the shadows to his advantage is the core element of the game, as “El Hijo” will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that “El Hijo” must traverse to reach his ultimate goal. - Survive the Wild West through the cleverness of a young hero - Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world - Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless - Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles - Use an arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes - Inspire other children to join you on the path to freedom - Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother","2024-06-18","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/WYjKQ407XRGoyRypUoBZTrPI.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4539-CUSA17029_00-BASEGAME00000000","50%","0","Unique","199.6","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/el-hijo-a-wild-west-tale/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","El Hijo - A Wild West Tale","TRD","www.handy-games.com GmbH","2021-03-25","el-hijo-a-wild-west-tale-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","0","249.50","1","",

"66","2024-07-03","This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4Ã¢„Â¢ version and the digital PS5Ã¢„Â¢ version of this game. After the animals of Torch City were defeated by the invading Robotic Legion in the Resistance War six years ago, former Resistance fighter Rayton the rabbit has kept a low profile. The arrest of a friend meant he had no choice but to put on his giant metal fist and fight against those oppressing him. Little did he know that he would soon be caught up in a maelstrom of conspiracies involving the Legion, the Resistance, and the Rat Gang. Ã¢—ï¿½Seamless Maps Filled with Challenges to Explore Explore more than a dozen unique areas in a Action Platformer style map. The core combat, puzzle-solving, and platform mechanics are complemented by countless hidden rooms, secret passages, and shortcuts, with all kinds of rewarding challenges for players to complete. Maps are loaded on the fly to avoid frequent transitions, making the massive Torch City feel even more detailed and alive. Ã¢—ï¿½An Arcade Combat System with Seamless Switching between Three Weapons The Fist, Drill, and Whip are three weapons with completely different fighting styles that offer seamless switching between high combo, high damage, and long range attacks. Pummel the enemy by choosing the most appropriate form of attack for the situation. Players will be challenged by dozens of distinct types of enemies, each with their own weapons and attacks, all working together to bring the player down. Unique bosses with unusual fighting styles provide a new and unique gaming experience. Ã¢—ï¿½Diesel-punk Aesthetics Crafted with Unreal Engine 4 The game's diesel-punk aesthetics were inspired by diesel combustion engines that were blended with an Eastern cityscape from a bygone era to give Torch City a signature one-of-a-kind visual feel. The stark contrast between furry animals and sterile mechanical soldiers introduce the theme of conflict in the game story. The realistic 3D visuals powered by Unreal Engine 4 combined with Physically-Based Rendering take the Action Platformer genre to a whole new level of graphics quality.","2024-06-18","/game/83127","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202105/1407/a0v5crJH2yW6mjjLVLI5TeHB.png?w=200","12","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8192-PPSA03969_00-FISTSIEEPS5HD002","60%","20","Action","101.43","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/fist-forged-in-shadow-torch/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch","TRD","Shanghai Hode Information Technology Co.,Ltd.","2021-09-06","fist-forged-in-shadow-torch-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","289.84","16","115.93","1","",

"64","2024-07-03","The apocalypse wasn’t the end of the world. Just the one we knew. Enter the Days of Doom, a post-apocalyptic tactical RPG roguelite that challenges players to reach Sanctuary, a place of promise and respite in a world of colorful chaos. Starting with a small cast of survivors, you’ll chart a path to reach your ultimate destination, encountering threats, including zombies, raiders, and even zombie raiders! Along the way you will need to recruit a ragtag band of heroes to protect your growing community and fight your way forward. Discovering how to best utilize each hero's unique abilities is the key to success in Days of Doom’s turn-based combat. Attack with Pyro early in the battle, as he ignites enemies for lasting damage. Then combine the Hydromancer and the Thrasher in a one-two knockout punch. Hydromancer can set the stage with a ranged water attack, and then the Thrasher can deliver a shocking surprise to wet enemies. The odds against you may seem insurmountable, but if you use your heroes' abilities strategically, upgrade them, and add new abilities along the way, you might just make it. No two runs are ever the same, which keeps you at the top of your game, and makes Days of Doom inherently replayable.

"61","2024-07-03","Tannenberg brings the massive battles of the Eastern Front in WW1 to life with 40 players fighting for control of key sectors of the battlefield, each one offering a distinct strategic advantage. Warfare between the Russian Empire, Germany, and their allies offers a fresh experience for first person shooter players and history aficionados alike. There are seven squads, 50+ weapons, nine large maps that give players tactical freedom, and a 40 player game mode with full AI bot support so you can experience epic battles at any time! Everything has been recreated with the same attention to detail seen in Verdun, the first entry in the WW1 Game Series. This historical game takes place across the lakes, forests, mountains and snowy plains of the Eastern Front - it was inspired by the Battle of Tannenberg in 1914, one of the most iconic encirclement battles in history. Players will be able to master a range of authentically modelled equipment brought to the field by Russian Frontovik and Cossack squads, Latvian Riflemen, the Roumanians, or join the Central Powers to serve in an Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. squad, German Infanterie, or the Bulgarians. Tannenberg offers several game modes - including the exciting Maneuver game mode reflecting the nature of war on the Eastern Front, as 40 players battle across large maps where the objectives and battle lines are always shifting. Survive the deadly battles by working together with your four man squad and utilizing your distinctive skills. There is a wealth of historical detail including realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on real battlefields. It’s all-out war on the Eastern Front! From artillery barrages and poison gas to the deadly heavy machine gun and hard-hitting rifle, there are many weapons to master. The battlefield is a dangerous place, and a little thought will help you stay alive – lead your shots, keep your eyes open, and be ready to engage in ferocious close combat at any moment. Just make sure you don’t get outflanked and encircled before you can do the same to your enemies! The WW1 Game Series currently includes Tannenberg and Verdun (set on the Western Front), with a new game Isonzo coming soon with mountain warfare on the Italian Front! These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. Extensive research has been conducted, with uniforms recreated to the tiniest detail and weapons modelled to exact references. **Cross play supported between console platforms.**","2024-06-18","/game/53337","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202002/2812/7lTuF0Wo4f9DT4oMjxx2xks4.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1662-PPSA02756_00-9956598540657310","75%","23","Action, Shooter, Shooter","124.75","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/tannenberg/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Tannenberg","TRD","BlackMill Games B.V.","2021-06-15","tannenberg-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","499.00","21","124.75","1","",

"56","2024-07-03","Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting, the game which started the WW1 Game series. The vicious close quarters nature of trench warfare means that skill with a bayonet can be as vital as good aim with a rifle. The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man’s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn’t for the faint hearted! Looking for more WW1 action? Check out Tannenberg for Eastern Front maneuver warfare, or the upcoming Isonzo for Italian mountain warfare!","2024-06-18","/game/18125","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202012/0822/DTzPcBOwcSWWl5HrVa1d8jYE.png?w=200","15","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1662-PPSA02758_00-1206800080748220","75%","0","Action, Shooter, Shooter","124.75","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/verdun/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Verdun","TRD","BlackMill Games B.V.","2021-06-15","verdun-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","499.00","0","124.75","1","",

Now, in a new interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse, you can play the history of one of the weirdest, wildest game developers to ever exist – a man who loved shooters and sheep, lasers and llamas. LLAMASOFT Journey back in time to an era of cassette tapes, photocopied zines, and README.TXT. An era in which a kid with a Commodore VIC-20 and dreams of radioactive sheep could become one of Britain's best-known game makers. A virtual museum of design documents, playable games, and all-new video features tell the fascinating story of a true independent game designer. PLAY THE ACCLAIMED ORIGINALS Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story includes 42 classic games from 8 different platforms, from Jeff Minter's earliest work on the Sinclair ZX81 and Commodore VIC-20, to later work on the Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Atari 800, and deep into the 16-bit era with the Atari ST and Atari Jaguar. GRIDRUNNER: REMASTERED Jeff's signature shooter masterpiece Gridrunner gets an all-new look from Digital Eclipse, updated into thrilling modern graphics and sound – while still running the core of the Commodore 64 version for 100% gameplay accuracy. GAMES, GAMES, GAMES Sheep In Space. Andes Attack. Attack of the Mutant Camels. Matrix. Metagalactic Llamas Battle at the Edge of Time. Hellgate. Laser Zone. And many more. All the Minter classics you've heard of (and several you probably haven't), now with new quality-of-life features to make playing them more fun than ever before. Two of Jeff Minter's earliest ""light synthesizers,"" Psychedelia and Colourspace, are also included, with all-new options and features optimized for controller-based play. Finally, Jeff's demo of Attack of the Mutant Camels for the unreleased Konix Multi-System console is also included. THE GOLD MASTER SERIES New from Digital Eclipse (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, The Making of Karateka), the Gold Master Series presents iconic games in an innovative ""interactive documentary"" format, putting the shared history of games and their creators into one comprehensive package.","2024-06-18","/game/141861","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0920/4cbf3dd99220ac587e0d52a96536aa17615d323b9918c89a.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7816-PPSA18158_00-0079142450506243","25%","0","Arcade, Shooter","546.75","null","null","Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story","TRD","Digital Eclipse Entertainment Partners Co.","2024-03-13","llamasoft-the-jeff-minter-story-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","729.00","0","546.75","1","",

Looking for answers, you explore your environment and fragments of memories. On your journey you are repeatedly confronted with riddling tasks, driven by the desire to find out what's going on. What happened last night? Why can't you think of any other thing aside from your days as a stage builder at the circus? As things get crazier and more bizarre, the lines between reality, memory, and imagination become more and more blurred and you realize: there is no going back. You have to do whatever it takes to bring this story to an end, no matter at what cost... ""The feeling of safety is an elusive one. It's not over yet."" SETTING In REVEIL, the player is immersed into a world, designed with attention to detail, where the boundaries between reality and illusion become blurred. The setting is an authentically orchestrated environment inspired by the circus of the 60s, which soon takes on surreal features.

Once caught in the maelstrom of deceptive impressions, memory fragments and mysterious visions, your only option is to dive deeper - in the hope of finding answers to your perplexing situation and condition, even if this hope is slowly fading.

"","2024-07-03","Solasta: Crown of the Magister brings back the thrill, tactics, and deep storytelling of tabletop games. As you play, you'll feel yourself reaching for your dice and miniatures. It's time to dive into the world of Solasta! Roll for initiative, take attacks of opportunity, manage player location and the verticality of the battle field. Set yourself up for the finishing strike and possibly roll a natural 20 at that key moment of a battle. In Solasta, you take control of four heroes, each with unique skills that complement one another. Every hero expresses themselves in the adventure, making each action and dialogue choice a dynamic part of the story. Players will create their heroes just as they would in a pen-and-paper game by choosing their race, class, personality, and rolling for their stats. You make the choices, dice decide your destiny. An Epic Team Adventure Discover the shattered world of Solasta. Explore ruins and dungeons for legendary treasures, learn the truth of an age-old cataclysm—and stop it from happening again. Create your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. Tailor your squad to your preferred strategy and maximize your party's abilities. The choice is yours. Online Multiplayer Co-op Play any campaign with up to 4 players for more fun and shenanigans! The best part? The host shares all their DLC with the other players! Time to fireball some friends. Discover a Mysterious & Dynamic World Delve into long-forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. Fight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over—on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground. Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions The dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. Size also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though—the monsters are also thinking vertically. Custom Campaigns In Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the official campaign is over.

"","2024-07-03","Fast & fluid arcade-style SHMUP meets hardcore roguelike! Take flight on a pimped-up jetboard and face off against massive, multi-stage bosses. A classic for the next generation! An intense, arcade-style, 'bullet hell' SHMUP/STG in which you must master a vast array of ridiculous weaponry in order to defeat a race of evil aliens who are intent on abducting innocent civilians and turning them into mutants. Jetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern roguelikes. Don't expect a story. Do expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced 60fps action, big guns, and explosions! The Jetboard: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock. The Enemies: Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game's weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too… The Weapons: From the conventional to the ridiculous! Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission! and leave a path of total destruction in your wake. Get up close and dish out massive damage with the shotgun, wreak havoc with the cluster bomb, fry enemies to a crisp with the flame tornado or shock them into submission with the lightning bolt. You'll get a different selection of weapons with each playthrough and you'll need to master them all! The Bosses: Defeat huge bosses in a series of grueling multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use. Rendered in exquisite pixel-art detail, these guys will test your weapon-handling and evasive maneuvering to their limits. The Planets: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons. Adapt your route based on your playstyle, the weapons you unlock and the treasure you discover.

"","2024-07-03","Manage your own farm in the game Farm Tycoon! Expand your farm business, produce cheap and sell your products at high prices. Control the land cultivation process, select the best employees, buy the most appropriate farm equipment, raise livestock and process the harvested crops. Various camera modes allow you to enter into a strategic view as well as to look at the world through the eyes of the employee. Respond to the changing weather and seasons. Create a greenhouse to sell crops in early spring. Buy new and used special agricultural machinery to quickly harvest and sell crops before their expiration date. Optimize costs and employ seasonal workers only during the harvest time. Accept challenges from neighbors to prove who is the best farmer in the area. You do not want to cultivate typical wheat, don't you? Perhaps you would love to have an orchard with apples, strawberries or cucumbers? In Farm Tycoon you can have more than 20 different crops that you can cultivate by hand or using machines, where each harvest has a precise expiration date. Before you plant your seedlings, first remember about the proper preparation of the land for cultivation. Watch your plants as they grow from green, fragile seedlings up to the state of flowering, ripening and ready for harvest. Do not forget about watering in periods of drought. If plants are not cared for properly they become ill, lose their quality and eventually die. On the machine market you can buy both new and used agricultural machinery. You have a choice between nearly 40 machines. Remember that cheaper, used machines can break down more quickly, especially when inexperienced employee operates the machine. Before buying your first agricultural machine, build a garage to ensure sufficient space to park it. A real farm is not just about agriculture fields. You can choose from more than 40 buildings, starting from farm buildings and barns to processing plants and factories. Has the plague affected your harvest? Maybe it is time to invest in a factory? Build a specialized factory to process what you have managed to grow. Produce juices and frozen food. Have you produced too much sheep's, cow's or goat's milk? Start producing cheese or butter, unless you prefer to switch your farm for the production of meat. The cultivation of plants is not enough? Farm Tycoon allows for breeding animals. Starting from the smallest such as bees, rabbits or turkeys, but you can also breed goats and cows. Be sure to provide them with adequate animal feed and skilled caregivers. Raise newly purchased animals before they begin to produce eggs or milk. Bees love buckwheat and colza, so create fields with suitable plants nearby. When the animals get sick you will need to call the vet, and if you want to breed your animals, you'll have to call the inseminator. Face variable weather conditions such as drought or torrential rain and collect all the crops before the first frost and snow. Look for a rainbow during a gentle rain or watch the lengthening shadows, changing sunlight and color depending on the current season. At any time you can enter the photo mode to take spectacular shots of your farm bathed in warm autumnal colors, or in a dark scenery during a lightning storm in the background.","2024-06-18","/game/124936","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/0513/aa1e3008b8b5be3cc8120bc5b4c5157beab5645f3c2b4ebc.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1549-PPSA20238_00-CLABS1FT20231109","40%","0","Educational, Simulation, Strategy","899.4","null","null","Farm Tycoon","TRD","PlayWay plc","2023-12-15","farm-tycoon-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1499.00","0","899.40","0","",

"","2024-07-03","Welcome to Not For Broadcast VR! The award-winning darkly comedic game of televised chaos that critics have called a “Bizarre masterpiece” and “Quite possibly the best FMV game ever"""" is now available in VR! Not For Broadcast VR takes the gameplay, story, and gripping dark comedy of the original award-winning FMV adventure and brings you closer to the news than ever. Get a full view of the entire newsroom, interact with your equipment and punch, slap and grab anything that dares to get between you and the truth. We promise it’s so immersive you’ll feel like you’re really being electrocuted by your poorly maintained equipment! Egotistical celebrities, dishonest politicians, and strange sponsors clash on the airwaves. You’re in the chair to ensure that the show goes on uninterrupted. Or at least, that’s what you’re getting paid for. There’s now nothing stopping you from spending all day hitting yourself on the head with VHS tapes, we suppose. Hand-pick the headlines… with your ACTUAL hands! Experience the lost art of inserting a VHS tape into a deck through the magic of virtual reality. Carefully position your “air-conditioning” so the news doesn’t overheat and turn spin wildly around your desk during the adverts (watch the cables, though). Plus, shake your fist in rage at whatever political ideology you don’t agree with (Or at everyone, it’s OK, they can’t see you). Frame the picture; frame the debate Keep the general public entertained with your editing skills, and keep an eye on those ratings. Make politicians look greedy or brave, make resistance leaders look noble or violent, and make news anchors look charming or unhinged. Who and what you decide to show on screen might change the course of history. No pressure. Keep it PG If VR was invented for anything, it was the simulation of pushing important-looking red buttons. Smash it (or gently tap it; it’ll work fine either way) to keep rude words (and other sensitive information) off the air. Keep the news safe for children and oppressive political regimes alike. Tune out the chaos, load up the ads, crank up the volume and immerse yourself in the dreams, fears, hopes and neurosis of an entire nation, all while sitting on your floor.","2024-06-18","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/2109/bb4ffdb077e6352c3af40a553e17db31b97e201c4617cb81.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-PPSA08716_00-9490505870769070","40%","0","Adult, Simulation, Casual","345.95","null","null","Not For Broadcast: VR","TRD","tinyBuild LLC","2023-12-14","not-for-broadcast-vr-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","629.00","0","377.40","1","",

"","2024-07-03","Potion Craft is an alchemist simulator where you physically interact with your tools and ingredients to brew potions. You're in full control of the whole shop: invent new recipes, attract customers and experiment to your heart's content. Just remember: the whole town is counting on you. LEARN THE ART OF POTION MAKING Concoct your potion plan. Grind ingredients and carefully mix them in your cauldron. Heat the coals. Boil and stir. Add the base: water, oil, or… something else. Congrats on your first potion! Was it easy to learn? Now try mastering it! EXPERIMENT AND INVENT NEW RECEPIES Carefully plan your route via the Alchemy Map to combine different effects. Be mindful of common sense: you won’t find a market for a poisonous healing potion… right? Or would you? SELL POTIONS Every day customers will come to your store looking for solutions to their problems. You will face consequences depending on what you decide to sell them. Attract guilds, befriend notable figures (or feud with them), gain riches and influence - and one day, you may even decide the fate of the whole town. BUY INGREDIENTS OR GROW YOUR OWN Every alchemist needs ingredients. You can buy them from traveling merchants: it can be pricey, but successful haggling may save you some coin. Or you can just grow your own! GET CREATIVE WITH CUSTOMIZING Want to give a special appearance to your best potions? Go ahead! Change bottle shape, label type, icon, and colors. You can even give it a custom name and label description. Carefully arrange your unique potions to showcase them on your shop’s shelves and tables… or carelessly throw them around - we’re not gonna tell you what to do, just have fun!","2024-06-18","/game/92845","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0912/ac2dfdeed5f1c002e3d11d4fe0b9aaf2823fbf96450d7a8f.png?w=200","18","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0096-PPSA09609_00-2925549421292841","30%","36","Casual, Simulation, Puzzle","324.35","null","null","Potion Craft: Alchemist Simulator","TRD","tinyBuild LLC","2023-12-12","potion-craft-alchemist-simulator-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","499.00","22","349.30","1","",

Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise. But what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart. Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic EvilnessÃ¢„Â¢. Features: • Everything is better with DwarvesÃ¢„Â¢: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources. • It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! • Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. • New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. • Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. • Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. • Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. • Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

Players take control of Lyn Graves, the precocious niece of legendary treasure hunter Zachary Graves. Lyn visits her uncle’s mansion with her closest compatriots, only to find the house overrun with ghouls and monsters who quickly grab and spirit away her friends. In order to free her uncle and her friends, and capture all the supernatural foes, Lyn must find the shattered pieces of a magical urn and put them back together. Through procedurally generated room layouts, shifting walls, unpredictable enemy placements, and unique ghostly encounters, Lyn must creep, sneak, and dash her way through hordes of ghouls and eerie ectoplasms in order to locate her friends and uncle. Each urn shard is fiercely guarded by a bone-chilling boss — with 3D isometric stealth gameplay, Lyn must think on her feet to conquer each challenge.

Enter the Days of Doom, a post-apocalyptic tactical RPG roguelite that challenges players to reach Sanctuary, a place of promise and respite in a world of colorful chaos. Starting with a small cast of survivors, you’ll chart a path to reach your ultimate destination, encountering threats, including zombies, raiders, and even zombie raiders! Along the way you will need to recruit a ragtag band of heroes to protect your growing community and fight your way forward. Discovering how to best utilize each hero's unique abilities is the key to success in Days of Doom’s turn-based combat. Attack with Pyro early in the battle, as he ignites enemies for lasting damage. Then combine the Hydromancer and the Thrasher in a one-two knockout punch. Hydromancer can set the stage with a ranged water attack, and then the Thrasher can deliver a shocking surprise to wet enemies. The odds against you may seem insurmountable, but if you use your heroes' abilities strategically, upgrade them, and add new abilities along the way, you might just make it. No two runs are ever the same, which keeps you at the top of your game, and makes Days of Doom inherently replayable. Features Beautifully animated hand-drawn art that brings the quirky vision of the post apocalypse to life Eight character classes, each equipped with unique default and special abilities A dozen enemies from the archetypal zombie, to deadly raiders, to explosive monstrosities and two surprisingly brutal boss fights Over 50 randomly occurring events that present risk-reward scenarios Over 70 items and runes to collect to turn the odds in your favor Roguelite progression means no two runs will be the same, but you permanently upgrade stats like party size and speed of resource accumulation, which means each run will get you closer to reaching your goal Original orchestral soundtrack by Jelle Dittmar","2024-06-18","/game/129709","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2215/a2c4ed39850edea9177c0e5777ab08a3396c09c8664aae34.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0182-CUSA42288_00-0510635658590121","40%","0","Strategy, Strategy","449.4","null","null","Days of Doom","TRD","ATARI EUROPE S.A.S.U.","2023-09-20","days-of-doom-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","749.00","0","449.40","1","",

"","2024-07-03","One summer's day, Usada and Kotora go to the library to do their homework. While Kotora takes her studies seriously, Usada has her head in the clouds. She wanders over to a bookshed deep inside, returning with a big, thick book. ""I found this interesting-looking book!"" Kotora looks back at her quizzically. Suddenly, a slip of paper falls out from the book. The letter reads: ""Find Alice."" As soon as they read the words, the two are enveloped in a blinding light. When they come to, they're in a grassy field that they've never seen before. At that moment, a white rabbit comes hopping along. He might know how to get back to their own world! The pair take their first steps into the world of this magical book, in order to go searching for the white rabbit... Alice Escaped! is an exploratory 2D action Metroidvania. Follow the adventures of Usada and Kotora, who have wandered into a strange wonderland of grimoires and must chase after a mysterious girl named Alice in order to return to their own world. What awaits them in this mysterious world are strange yet familiar characters, such as Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, and Humpty Dumpty. Are they friends or foes? And why does the white rabbit Usamura have a zipper on his back? And who exactly is this enigmatic girl hiding Alice in the deepest part of the world? This is where you've probably realized that this game has multiple endings. There are numerous major choices to be made, a story that repeats itself, and the true goals of the characters to be revealed. An adventure the likes of which you've never experienced before is about to begin! Ã¢–Â  Battle Action One of the core points of this game is its stylish, tag-team battle system! Swing Usada’s giant hammer to pulverize your enemies with powerful melee attacks, or use Kotora’s submachine gun and bombs to take out enemies from a distance. Switch between the two to chain impressive combos! Chaining combos will increase their attack power, and make it easier to quickly defeat your many oncoming enemies. Taking out enemies builds up your Chance Gauge, which can be used to perform supporting attacks and devastating ultimate attacks. (Feature not included in the demo.) The intensity builds in boss fights: whittle down their Shield Gauge to break their shields, letting you unleash a flurry of attacks. But beware: they've got a variety of powerful attacks to hit you back with! Ã¢–Â  Our heroines learn and grow When you collect the skill crystals that drop all over the world, you can improve your characters' skills. You can improve their weapons, which will then unlock unique skills. Or you can focus on their stats and movement, and even pick up skills to help them convince others to help them. If you find yourself stuck on a difficult boss, then try taking some time away from the main path to help our heroes grow stronger. Scattered about here and there in the world are death matches (areas where you can't proceed without defeating all of the enemies there), and if you can finish them with a high-count combo, or without taking any damage, you can earn skill crystal fragments. In addition, out in the world you can also find Heart Crystals, which increase your heroes' maximum health, in addition to other key items that they'll need on their adventure. Based on what you find, you might find that they're protected by powerful traps, just like the treasure you'd find deep inside of a cave. Go explore any way you wish in the world of Alice in Wonderland!","2024-06-18","/game/123552","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/1820/f41253f41480d5c0a2e1dafd651b1915afe01ac0126acd96.png?w=200","6","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0734-CUSA43414_00-0922380785609695","30%","12","Action","299.4","null","null","Alice Escaped!","TRD","SEKAI PROJECT, INC","2023-08-24","alice-escaped!-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","499.00","0","349.30","1","",

Would-be marijuana moguls will need to prioritize resources carefully as they manage the production and distribution of their weed. Cultivate killer plants, cross-breed them to create unique strains of the devil’s lettuce, hire and manage a growing staff, and be prepared to take on the competition. As in real life, the business of bud presents plenty of opportunity along with a plethora of problems. Decide when and where to take on extra risk to maximize profit, but be careful, the cops and politicians are all working their own angles. An important, controversial topic presented in an insightful and detailed manner, Weedcraft Inc presents a challenge to those who would rule the reefer, offering a series of diverse scenarios and unique characters to work with (or around) as your budding empire grows.

Bring your friends into the frontier in your own private server, or make new friends (and enemies) in large public multiplayer servers. Play peacefully in co-op, or use the dynamic multiplayer faction system to band together and split apart dynamically as allegiances change. Build ships from scratch and travel to new planets Your first planet is where you’ll learn to survive, but that’s just the start. Build your very own starship and use it to colonise new worlds. It won’t be easy, and only the most successful colonies will be able to pool the resources and knowledge necessary to break orbit. Once you launch, the stars hold brand-new planets, new biomes, bosses and challenges. Craft, research, loot and exploit your environment You’ll need to prepare to take on this hostile part of the galaxy. Get mining, farming, growing, developing, researching, and building hundreds of different items, from winter combat gear to advanced laboratories. Find something you can’t work out for yourself. Strap on your handcrafted laser rifle and venture out into the unknown to explore dungeons, procedural bases, NPC stores and much more. Defend what you’ve built, or take on the galaxy Defend your colony with fast-paced combat that utilizes physics like bullet drop, projectile speed and spread. Thwart enemy raids on your base with your stock of handcrafted grenades. Tired of just defending? Lay waste to enemy bases with destructible terrain as you wield everything from rusty old carbines to nuke launchers and energy weapons that harness the power of lightning! Develop and construct advanced bases for protection Grow from a tiny outpost into an advanced, nuclear-powered fortress. Manage resources carefully and choose research paths based on the items and challenges you encounter on each planet. Watch out, though: the bigger your colony gets, the more of a target it becomes for raiders (and jealous friends). Automate work and train up a team Even out here, you’re not alone. Save AI survivors and build a colony together. A range of unique stats, perks and flaws mean every colonist has something different to contribute. As your AI colonists complete tasks they’ll level up and get smarter, stronger and faster. Best of all, you can assign tasks and orders to NPCs to do the grunt work for you and prioritize their roles based on those skills. Want to take a break from mining to destroy an underground alien nest? Let your colonists handle that for you! And Remember Your ship may be in ruins, your ammunition running low, and your teammates scattered across the surface, but remember this: You’re more than just another adventurous spirit.

We’ve got moonshine in our blood - in the case of some old-timers, maybe even literally. We love to talk about likker, make it, drink it all day long - and we love to share it too! How 'bout that, my gaming friend? GET THE KNOW-HOW AND CRAFT FINE LIKKERS What’s your alcohol of choice? Do you maybe know how to make it? The process is a complex one, but with our know-how, we can shed some light on it, if you’d like; a little bit of moonlight - moonshine! - to guide you through the processes of fermentation, distillation, and bottling. RUN YOUR BASE SMART... AND BE DISCREET Makin’ booze is pure fun, but if you’re makin’ money too - now that’s the way to live. However, for that, you need to be smart, manage your base right, and not piss off the boys in blue... We tried to capture the life of a moonshiner as realistically as possible. You’ll be managing workers who’ll be crafting and maintaining your equipment, you’ll be buying ingredients, unlocking technologies, planning deliveries and finances, making sure you remain as discreet as possible - and deciding whom to trust and with whom to work. TAKE YOUR STORY TO METROPOLIS In our game, you take on the role of a young moonshiner. You will progress through main missions, you’ll be performing side quests, and running into road events during deliveries - the life of a moonshiner is ever-exciting and full of surprises... If you’ll be prospering, you’ll get the chance to create and manage bases in five different regions, each with its own, more and more challenging missions. From your hometown mountains, through the thicket of a forest and mud of a swamp, all the way to civilization to conquer the big city. How the story will end depends purely on you - there’ll be a pesky agent who’ll want to work with you, and there’ll be a corrupt governor that you can join. But you can also ignore them. You’re a free man, after all. That’s how Moonshine Inc. came to be. Made for moonshiners, amateurs, dreamers, and newbies. Sit down, launch the game, enjoy crafting and running your business, and relax… after all, ain't nothin’ illegal ‘til you get caught!

In Park Beyond, you are the creative force behind a series of amusement parks, a Visioneer, a combination of a creator, a manager, and a designer. In your role as Visioneer, every aspect of creating, managing, and designing successful amusement parks will be under your control. CREATE THE PARKS OF YOUR DREAMS As creative lead of the park, you can let your imagination off the leash! Build wild loops and hoops for a coaster like no other to attract thrill-seeking teens, research exciting flat rides to appeal to adults, or pop down cheery, adorable flat rides for families. But, you can also take things to the next level with unbelievable modules that add unique pizazz to your park. Going even further, you can adapt the entire world to your imagination by using terraforming tools to raise mighty mountains for your coasters to summit or whip up custom ride scenery using the modular building system that can be grouped, saved, and duplicated for quick and easy creativity! MANAGE AND OPTIMIZE FOR SUCCESS As a park manager, you’ll discover how to cater to your audiences and perfect your ride placement, prices, and shops to appeal to each audience. Guests will need to be supported by a specialized staff that you’ll hire and direct. You’ll also get to decide if you want your park to stay within the more grounded and realistic side of the theme park world or leave those limits behind in search of profits! Gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of visitor enjoyment using powerful heatmap tools that will let you precisely tweak their experience to your benefit. DESIGN WITH LIMITLESS FREEDOM Finally, as the park’s lead designer, you’ll have limitless freedom to customize every aspect of the park. Decorate your park, create themed areas and enjoy the almost limitless possibilities of customization. Create a comfortable, cosy experience for visitors with graceful paths leading through fun and playful scenes that you can arrange using the thousands of themed scenery props available with the base game. CAMPAIGN AND SANDBOX MODES If you’re new to the role of Visioneer, you can learn as you play in Campaign Mode. Are you more of a Creator or a Manager? Your Cloudstormer colleagues will help you understand every possible part of making your parks work perfectly. You’ll team up with them to tackle parks in need of refurbishment and resist the schemes of Cloudstormer’s main business rival, Hemlock. No matter which of these roles appeal to you the most, you’ll be able to choose how you want to play in Sandbox Mode, which can be adjusted to remove all limitations by giving you infinite money or turning off the need to research new rides. However, it can also make your challenges harder by cutting your starting budget or requiring that you buy every new plot of land you want to use, like the true theme park tycoon you are! So come visit Park Beyond today – no matter which type of Visioneer you are, this will be a theme park experience you’ll never forget!","2024-06-18","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0303/6d66ccf8eb33416df75e18ff5c62c662c3f504384db6c139.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0700-PPSA01683_00-LEGENDDLX0000000","45%","0","Simulation","1786.95","null","null","Park Beyond Visioneer Edition","TRD","BANDAI NAMCO ENTERTAINMENT EUROPE","2023-06-15","park-beyond-visioneer-edition-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","3249.00","0","1786.95","0","",

Micro Challenge brings an entire new take on the unique puzzle series by adding new player movement options and new terrain tiles. Whether you are a fan of the series or a first time player, this is the perfect place to start. Micro Challenge is a uniquely set up movement based puzzle game, and your goal is to examine each level and determine the most efficient route possible to collect all items before reaching the move limit. Like in previous entries your Player Tile can Move, Double Slide, Diagonal Slide, Tilt, and Teleport. Micro Challenge also adds the ability to change sizes. Shrink your tile down to fit through narrow hallways and corridors. Be careful when you are small as there are now towers filled with holes, and if you try to traverse them while in the shrunken state, you will fall to your demise! It costs 1 energy unit to shrink or to grow. This creates an entire new style of puzzle design in which you must determine when it's most beneficial to change sizes in your route planning. Micro Challenge features the ability for the Tile to become ""micro"" but it is ALSO a ""micro"" sized Tilting Tiles game. Micro Challenge is designed to be a perfect starting point for the franchise. It features 20 unique levels and 5 creative multiplayer maps! Not only does Micro Challenge feature a focused and unique single player puzzle set, it also contains a series first, with the all new Tilting Tiles Multiplayer Mode. Grab a friend and solve your way through Tilting Tiles Maps together. Both players share a move count, so you must examine the level together and determine who can collect which items more efficiently. Each player is given a different set of problems to solve as well as a different amount of special moves available.

The fearsome orc clans, more numerous than ever, lurk on all roads. The proud nomadic peoples of the steppes are on the alert, for strange beasts prowl the darkness. Not even the stout dwarves, hidden in their underground palaces, seem safe from threat - from the unknown tunnels of its mines, a foul army of hideous creatures advances inexorably.

"","2024-07-03","The Gods have abandoned Midgard. Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.","2024-06-18","/game/70710","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","80%","14","Action, Adventure, Music/Rhythm","75.8","null","null","ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree","TRD","Untold Tales S.A.","2023-02-09","atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","379.00","5","75.80","1","",

While doing so, he tries to persuade fellow pirate captains to join his fleet, all with with their own ships and individual abilities.

Endless procedurally generated dungeons, countless monsters, grafting, crafting and a vast amount of skill trees and items allow for unlimited replayability. DELVE INTO THE LORE Evil has been vanquished. Peace has returned to Ancardia, and the peasants dare to dream once more of prosperity. Seven very different factions vie for control over the cataclysmic aftermath left behind by Andor Drakon’s defeat. And somewhere, deep down in an inhospitable cave, ChAoS is stirring again. Pick up your blade, prepare your spells, check your daggers and ready your bow, for you are about to enter the ominous Caverns of Chaos. Choose your allegiance carefully, for you are nothing more than an expendable asset to the masters you choose. Fight for a mercenary's glory and purse, for the justice of a folk in decline, for the light of purity or even for ChAoS itself.

Two swords and an axe to harvest more body parts than ever before. CHALLENGING AND UNCOMPROMISING, YET REWARDING Countless options of how to tackle the dungeons awaiting you. Befriend or tame creatures, slay monsters, delve deeper or keep exploring and expanding the cavern levels you have already found. Over 200 different foes await, each requiring matching tactics.

"","2024-07-03","In this narrative-driven, third-person survival horror game set 300 years in the future, the player will take on the role of Jacob Lee – a victim of fate thrown into Black Iron Prison, a maximum-security penitentiary located on Jupiter's moon, Callisto. When inmates begin to transform into monstrous creatures, the prison is thrown into chaos. To survive, Jacob must battle his way to safety to escape Black Iron Prison, while uncovering the dark and disturbing secrets buried beneath the surface of Callisto. Using a unique blend of shooting and close-quarters combat, Jacob will need to adapt his tactics to combat the rapidly evolving creatures while scavenging to unlock new weapons, gear, and abilities to outrun the growing threat and escape the horrors of Jupiter's Dead Moon. HORROR ENGINEERING The Callisto Protocol is a next-generation take on survival horror from the mind of Glen Schofield. Blending atmosphere, tension, and brutality with terrifying moments of helplessness and humanity, The Callisto Protocol immerses players in a pulse-pounding story where unspeakable horrors lurk around every corner. UNCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE UNITED JUPITER COMPANY Set on Jupiter’s dead moon Callisto in the year 2320, The Callisto Protocol casts players as Jacob Lee, an inmate in Black Iron Prison. When a mysterious outbreak throws the moon into chaos, Jacob must face his darkest fears to defeat the bloodthirsty creatures that stalk him as he unravels the dark mysteries at the heart of the powerful United Jupiter Company. MASTER BRUTAL, STRATEGIC COMBAT The Callisto Protocol challenges players to master a thrilling blend of hand-to-hand and ranged combat, including a unique gravity weapon once used by Black Iron guards to control the prison population. Players will be forced to get up close and personal with their grotesque opponents, hacking off limbs, blasting off legs, and getting creative with whatever is at their disposal to survive each life-or-death encounter. EXPERIENCE THE ISOLATION OF JUPITER'S DEAD MOON One of the most hostile, isolated environments in the universe, Callisto looms large over Jacob’s desperate struggle to survive. Players must not only contend with the horrors of Black Iron Prison, but also the centuries-old secrets that plague Jupiter’s long-dead moon, both above and below the surface.","2024-06-18","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202206/0222/pqZVlL42HwbUMdSAyNQoRnzg.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5262-PPSA03352_00-9436657797426872","70%","0","Horror","999999","null","null","The Callisto ProtocolÃ¢„Â¢","TRD","KRAFTON, Inc.","2022-12-02","the-callisto-protocol-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","0","524.70","1","",

"","2024-07-03","Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom is a history-driven turn-based strategy set in World War 2. You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies. Possible alternate history flow - what would have happened if the Allies followed the ideas of Operation Unthinkable and went to war against the USSR in 1946? Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Advanced army manager - choose the composition of your forces. Acquire new units, upgrade or dismiss the outdated ones. Make sure that your forces have all the necessary tools for the upcoming battle. Real WW2 heroes - assign historical personalities to your armies and get access to special skills. Realistic 3D graphics - study the battle map and take advantage of 3D graphics, featuring volumetric terrain and physically-simulated movement of units. Attention to detail - game created by a team passionate about WW2 history.","2024-06-18","/game/107830","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0910/r28qdLdXatQ9aY1ux0GGRoQl.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4886-CUSA34476_00-8237173962609670","45%","0","Strategy","374.5","null","null","Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom","TRD","Klabater","2022-09-22","strategic-mind-fight-for-freedom-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","749.00","0","411.95","1","",

See the world through the eyes of a cat and interact with the environment in playful ways. Be stealthy, nimble, silly, and sometimes as annoying as possible with the strange inhabitants of this mysterious world. Along the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B-12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out. Stray is developed by BlueTwelve Studio, a small team from the south of France mostly made up of cats and a handful of humans.","2024-06-18","/game/79790","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202206/0300/E2vZwVaDJbhLZpJo7Q10IyYo.png?w=200","5","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2333-PPSA02101_00-STRAYSIEE0000000","40%","10","Adventure","449.4","null","null","Stray","TRD","Annapurna Interactive","2022-07-19","stray-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","749.00","6","449.40","1","",

Presented in a non-linear, open format, the game provides a dark and mysterious narrative within a gloomy and vast, interconnected decaying city.

In order to survive in this world after the end of mankind, the player will have a diverse selection of weaponry and items available, ranging from energy blades, to riot shields, to rocket launchers. The twisted biomachines which inhabit the lonely world of REDO! breathe fire, electrify air and spit plasma. You will need every tool available to survive.

"","2024-07-03","Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is a standalone release of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed Dragonfall campaign, which first premiered as a major expansion for Shadowrun Returns. The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game making it the definitive version on consoles of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience. Man Meets Magic & Machine In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return… Key Features A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters. A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into. Command Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in. Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfall’s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.

"","2024-07-03","Take part in a roller coaster of emotions with Louise embarking on a road trip of a lifetime through the late 1960s USA, trying to show her son Mitch how to navigate the often cruel modern world. What Does It Take To Be A Mother? Telling good from bad was never easy, all the less when you're a single mum in her late 20s with a clever 8-year-old under your care. Each choice you make in the crucial few moments we all know may change our lives for good in a split of a second, influence what kind of person Mitch turns out to be and what values shall guide him once he becomes his own man. Why Are You Who You Are? Find clues as to why Louise’s life is what it is today, take crucial decisions no other person would be strong enough to stomach and show Mitch what he needs to see in order for him to become independent, suave and brave enough to conquer the day. Everything Has Consequences Your decisions REALLY matter! To keep track of Mitch’s growth as a person, each choice you make adds positive or negative points to three key statistics: Righteousness, Confidence, and Relations. These influence which type of ending Mitch will reach at the end of the game - there are 9 unique endings in total! Everybody Has Their Story The 1960s were tumultuous in more ways than one - the Summer of Love, the Vietnam War, the survivors and the losers of the great upheaval in history. Canned Heat was “Going Up the Country” while Bob Dylan asked “How does it feel” to have no home and live on the street. Travel across the country and meet a plethora of characters that may help or may dissuade Louise from her goals - including the most controversial groups many thought long gone. Best Month Ever! Official Soundtrack included! It'll Be The Best Month Ever! is a complete collection of 29 beautiful, expressive, folk, country and jazz-inspired melodies prepared by the composer JÃ„â„¢drzej BÃ„…czyk (Pan JÃ„â„¢dras). The stunning, nearly 80-minute original soundtrack is an excellent addition to the narrative adventure game, creating the musical soundscape of the main characters' journey across the 1960s USA. CONTENT WARNING The game includes scenes and storyline elements that some people may find disturbing and emotionally heavy.

In This War Of Mine, you do not play as an elite soldier, rather as a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with a lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The Complete Edition consists of a full version of the base game, The Little Ones DLC and all three narrative-driven scenarios, each showing a different perspective of war. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During a war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine: Complete Edition consists of: - This War of Mine: Final Cut – a full version of the base game - The Little Ones DLC – exploring the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child - Father's Promise DLC tells the story of a family’s struggle to preserve the last pieces of humanity in times of despair and cruelty. - The Last Broadcast DLC explores the role of truth in a time of despair. As a radio operator broadcasting in a war-torn city, face the dilemma of whether there is a line beyond which the truth can be sacrificed. - Fading Embers DLC that portrays the story of Anja.

Look at your creation in a 360 degrees view, zooming in and out to marvel at its beauty.

ECONOMICS, ERRORS AND MORE! A unique economic system provides you with a key objective - make your station efficient and profitable or fail! The normal route of business can be, however, disrupted by a number of disruptions: from hacker attacks to error and malfunctions each module and its system entail in your management of the station. Your production may also simply overload, given the production strain - so plan, execute and design to perfection! EXPLORE UNKNOWN PLANETS There are 3 distinct campaign missions where you need to terraform a given planet, make it habitable and easy to extract resources from. Built with a background narrative, each of these missions enable you to focus on the two game modes in order to build your station in such a way as to successfully fulfill their objectives. Are you going to be the most efficient, the most industrious or have the most graphically appealing modules set-up? Anything goes as long as the mission is successful!

A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!

After years of serving as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with her own life. But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they’d ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she’s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can’t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years. While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she’s felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail’s death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries.

"","2024-07-03","Before he was the world’s greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naivetÃƒÂ© of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","2024-06-18","/game/82678","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png?w=200","13","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCOFROGWARESUAK","80%","29","Adventure, Action","225.8","null","null","Sherlock Holmes Chapter One","TRD","FROGWARES IRELAND LTD","2021-11-15","sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1129.00","21","225.80","1","",

In Train Station Renovation you play as a renovation company specialised in restoring railway stations. The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas.

Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment.

"","2024-07-03","FROSTPUNK: COMPLETE COLLECTION CONSISTS OF: Frostpunk – the full version of the highly acclaimed society survival game, which sold over 3 000 000 copies worldwide and won a number of critics awards. Frostpunk Season Pass - a set of three expansions of the Frostpunk universe: • The Last Autumn is a turning point in the Frostpunk universe. Revealing the restless events of Site 113 and its struggle to construct the generator before the freezing veil shrouds the Earth, this prequel expansion broadens the Frostpunk universe by introducing a new environment, new Books of Laws and unique technologies, and presents a range of new buildings — all of which let you shape society and the city in unconventional ways. • On The Edge expansion tells a story of citizens of New London sent for a special assignment after the Great Storm. It not only opens a brand new chapter set in the Frostpunk universe but also pits you against new challenges and offers unique mechanics, both in the city and on the Frostland map - further enriching the core experience. • The Rifts allows you to experience a new level of challenge on a brand new Endless Mode map, where the land itself threatens your survival. Using a new gameplay mechanic, bridge the rifts to access new areas. Expand the city to save your people from the inevitable doom! ABOUT THE GAME Frostpunk is a blend of city-builder, society survival and a strategy game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and the present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?","2024-06-18","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202107/1311/4N4eGyrwGerDc9krtKnthKRN.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKCOMPLET","85%","0","Strategy, Strategy, Simulation","169.35","null","null","Frostpunk: Complete Collection","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2021-07-20","frostpunk-complete-collection-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1129.00","0","169.35","1","",

Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as ‘Shard’ spreads throughout the underworld. With the city’s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city’s fate. Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to die… unless you decide they must. Key Features: Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it’s sneaking through levels or attacking head-on Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle A reactive story where the player’s choices have real consequences Stylized pixel art environments and characters Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley Gameplay: Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them. Tackle encounters in lethal, high-octane combat, or use your wits to stick to the shadows, utilizing distraction techniques and non-lethal attacks to reach your objective. Augmentation: Unlock cybernetic upgrades to augment your abilities via upgrade trees, and build upon your playstyle to improve your stealth or increase the lethality of attacks through talent trees. Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground. Reactive Story: Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld. Crush entire factions or convince them to aid your cause. Your destiny is yours to write. The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","2024-06-18","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202012/0911/p1JVnlcxQf2oQI7qC2gMfz8n.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2520-CUSA23292_00-DISJUNCTIONBUNDL","88%","0","Role-Playing","53.88","null","null","Disjunction - Digital Deluxe Edition","TRD","Fireshine Games","2021-01-27","disjunction-digital-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","449.00","0","53.88","1","",

Get ready to command an odd squad of fun birds and devise a plan to bring them safe and sound to the end of the battlefield. An outlandish puzzle game that will challenge your mind to make these greenhorn recruits into brave soldiers. Not everything is as it seems in this fun game, because these ""flying soldiers"" can hardly glide a few inches and they don't exactly have the abilities to go into battle. So, it's no surprise that, with squads made up of these ""characters"", they wouldn't be able to get themselves out of the mess they're in. Their only hope lies in your tactical skills to help them advance. Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help. It's not only about strategic placement of the limited objects available throughout the terrain. You also have to think about the soldiers' positions and skills; timing their movements right; and how they interact with objects.","2024-06-18","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/2017/xEklooqKV4sYz7liyfsMYa3b.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3877-CUSA20588_00-FLYINGAVATARBUND","89%","0","Family, Puzzle, Unique","41.69","null","null","Flying Soldiers","TRD","Wild Sphere S.L.","2020-12-09","flying-soldiers-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","379.00","0","41.69","1","",

But that was almost a decade ago, and time had ruthlessly passed them by. Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that is weirder than anything they've ever encountered before! NARRATIVE-DRIVEN, DETECTIVE GAMEPLAY Chicken Police is a story-rich and dialogue-heavy game combining elements of the visual novels and classic adventure games.

There are more than 30 places to visit and some of them will change several times during the story. You can return to previous locations on several occasions, to find hidden secrets, meet new characters and gather information about the world and its inhabitants. A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE Chicken Police has a weirdly stunning visual style made with the usage of real photos and photo-realistic 3D backgrounds, inspired by classic film-noir movies and influenced by animated features. Its noir mood is enhanced by an original music soundtrack, backed up by professional voice acting for all characters with more than 8 hours of spoken dialogue!

Join TY on a RIPPER of an adventure to free his family from the DREAMING and stop the nefarious evil genius BOSS CASS from removing mammals from the top of the food chain. To help you on your quest, you've got a BEAUT arsenal of boomerangs, sharp teeth, and the help of a few friends! So don’t be a galah - let's head down under, and have a CORKER of a time! BEAUTY, BOTTLER, BONZA! * Explore 17 levels of the Australian Outback in their old-school 3D platforming glory * 13 different boomerangs including the Frostyrang, Flamerang and powerful Doomerang * Improved camera & graphics; including updated shadows, reflections, HD resolutions and 60fps * New Gamemode called ""Hardcore Mode"" * New TY character skins * Audio Director's cut * Over 35 Trophies, including a Platinum Trophy, plus Speed Run and Time Attack Leaderboards. * * * * * G'day mate! Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago. But then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure! You see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open! Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans! Don't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie.

"","2024-07-03","Ashen is an open world co-op action RPG about a wanderer in search of a place to call home. Passive Co-Op Multiplayer As you adventure through Ashen, you'll occasionally encounter other players in a massive open world, akin to the passive multiplayer of Journey. It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore them. Souls with a Twist Ashen is faithful to the 'souls' genre of stamina-based combat, introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world. But here’s the twist - no two gameplay experiences are alike. Whether you’re exploring bogs, investigating a fjord or pillaging an old palace, where you are at any given moment will dramatically alter the course of your adventure. It's a brutal open world you're just living in it.","2024-06-18","/game/90941","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307mBvWd2WZCl31DaKZxuxhHDXDvhtlxS4r07oiAMQMdes-2Rhl3p88tZ5jJO4d6TJl_fO9AnAqovgCodYhrVWrnokNWnT.png?w=200","6","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2333-CUSA14345_00-ASHENSIEE0000000","75%","0","Action, Adventure, Action","249.75","null","null","Ashen","TRD","Annapurna Interactive","2019-12-12","ashen-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","999.00","0","249.75","1","",

As a battlemage gifted with both, you will use your skill at crafting spells to combat evil forces in a fast-paced, explosive fight for justice.
