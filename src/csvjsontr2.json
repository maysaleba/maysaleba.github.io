Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before.

THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you\u2019re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you\u2019re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you\u2019ll discover choices in this world aren\u2019t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment \u2013 the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small \u2013 like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction \u2013 but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don\u2019t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society\u2019s population.

Chime Sharp is an sequel to 2009's Chime, a music puzzle game with an addictive, ambient heartbeat. You tessellate shapes to cover a grid, while a beatline reads those shapes as notes. As you cover the board the music builds to a beautiful crescendo of your own design. The only way to discover Chime is to play it, but if you want a glimpse, consider what it might feel like to cross Tetris, a music sequencer and a hypnotic dream about your favourite pop song. Chime Sharp takes Chime's classic dynamic and updates it for 2017. The core rules are the same but the aesthetic is clean and modern and the game's soundtrack has been completely refreshed. With sixteen new levels, experimental modes, new-era connectivity and sharper ways to play, Chime's finally back -- and it wants to be your new favourite mixtape.

The game adds a layer of tactical combat to the genre by introducing the weapon of choice of musketeers: the musket.

Following the arrest of a prominent community leader, New York stands in disarray. Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as \u2018Shard\u2019 spreads throughout the underworld. With the city\u2019s future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city\u2019s fate. Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to die\u2026 unless you decide they must. Key Features: Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it\u2019s sneaking through levels or attacking head-on Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle A reactive story where the player\u2019s choices have real consequences Stylized pixel art environments and characters Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley Gameplay: Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them. Tackle encounters in lethal, high-octane combat, or use your wits to stick to the shadows, utilizing distraction techniques and non-lethal attacks to reach your objective. Augmentation: Unlock cybernetic upgrades to augment your abilities via upgrade trees, and build upon your playstyle to improve your stealth or increase the lethality of attacks through talent trees. Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground. Reactive Story: Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld.

The World: The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America\u2019s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2023-03-14","LowestPrice":"/game/70302","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0311/EcTm14LTNjRgt0qM2gHT4502.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2520-CUSA23292_00-2988533598676746","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7tNpIu4wnc","PercentOff":"66%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":52.02,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0311/EcTm14LTNjRgt0qM2gHT4502.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/disjunction","Title":"Disjunction","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-27","Slug":"disjunction-playstation-tr","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/4KmjWIdfXs","IsPS5":0,"Price":153,"MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":52.02,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"70","SaleEnds":"2023-03-29","description":"The official videogame of the Motocross Championship is back!

You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating \u2013 the 1990s \u2013 Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. \"IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN\" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen\u2026 In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels\u2026) impact the way you skate.

The game centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It\u2019s a shockingly enjoyable sci-fi action running game where the player uses techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts. As well as these evasive elements there\u2019s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations.

Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin\u2019s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind\u2019s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra\u2019s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra\u2019s discoveries as she learns more about her family\u2019s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra\u2019s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player\u2019s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra\u2019s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn\u2019t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE\u2019s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE\u2019s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.","SaleStarted":"2023-03-14","LowestPrice":"/game/70710","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200","MainStory":5,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqwwdGneIG4","PercentOff":"33%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Adventure, Music/Rhythm","PlusPrice":99.83,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Untold Tales S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2023-02-09","Slug":"atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":149,"MainExtra":6,"SalePrice":99.83,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-03-29","description":"Companionship awaits you!

For example, Elena's last mission was to safely recover stolen ancient relics. An unknown thief had ransacked the national museum and got away with the namesakes of the empire's oldest rulers. A team of detectives picked up a trail that led across the border, but then disappeared. The Queen summoned Elena. \"The items stolen are of paramount value to the empire and crown,\" she said in a slightly wavering voice. \"We mustn't lose them.\" \"I understand, your Majesty,\" Elena answered. \"But announcing their disappearance would only complicate the matter, so you must carry out your duty in the strictest secrecy! You shall at once be sent abroad under the guise of an ambassador to carry out your investigation in secret. You must track down the perpetrator and force them to return what was stolen.\" Elena soon found herself on a top-secret covert mission of vital interest to the Crown. Her first order of business upon arrival was notifying the local police of the missing valuables. \"Were the items stolen from your hotel or at the port?\" Asked the chief of police, his moustache twitching like a walrus'. \"Neither,\" Elena answered, \"they were stolen on the boat, but I know for certain the culprit is still here. \"Hm...very well,\" the officer let out with an air of authority. \"We'll get on the case at once, don't you worry. There isn't a criminal out there who can slip away from me...\" By evening, the list of suspects had been narrowed down to a few names. Elena asked the chief if she could accompany the detectives to identify the culprit, and he gave his permission. Elena was not only sharp as a tack, but was well-versed in the new deductive method, which had already helped her crack open five robbery cases, two murders and one case of destruction of hotel property. In the end, Elena and the detective team tracked down the artifact thief and were just waiting for the judge to sign the arrest warrant, when an urgent telegram came in from the Prime Minister with orders to meet that very night. She had no choice but to return home that very instant and put her operation on hold. What was it that happened in the palace that forced her to abandon her job and return immediately? Join Elena on an unforgettable adventure through an alternate Victorian world across the endless Emperor Desert Valley, the green banks of the Nile, a volcanic island and more! Will good conquer evil? Can Elena return the Crown of the Empire?

The first time Claeg realized something was wrong was when he went out on an errand for his wife Emma.

He walked all the way back home covered in blood to meet the panicked tears of his wife, children, and friends. From then on, it took Claeg every fiber of his being to concentrate even on the smallest task. Doing work on the farm became insurmountable labor, and his children wept in the corners when he mixed up their names and faces. Emma took him to countless doctors who couldn\u2019t give a name to his ailment, but any person of the cloth they met all said the same thing: A demon was slowly taking over Claeg\u2019s body, and he was in dire need of salvation. \u201cThe demon is only sated after sacrifice!\u201d The good Christians would wail. \u201cStop him before it\u2019s too late.\u201d But the time to stop Claeg never came.

The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always sunshines and rainbows. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their emotional meltdowns and PR nightmares can spell financial disaster for your company. It's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of gossip magazines, super fans, and rival groups, all thirsty for a scoop on the latest scandal. There's a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's nothing personal, it's just business. ■Idol Training Provide voice training and dance lessons to the idols you have scouted, and train them to become top-notch idols.

Whatever happened, she was driven to find order, to find a way to balance the odds. The rabbit hole she followed led deeper and deeper into a shadowy sect of the AHA that sought to keep the world\u2019s unpalatable truths covered. As she passed from success to success, the sect assigned her to straighten out one of their wayward sons, Isaac Powell. Powell, now The Night Seer, impressed Ozols with his vision of a world turned upside down. She grew jealous of his foresight and saw the way to achieve the justice she craved: a way to balance the rightness of actions by both their past and future effects. Ozols gained the Night Seer\u2019s trust, and he confided in her the ritual he had undertaken. She repeated it, and as the power coursed through her, it left her blind to the present, but with a powerful and uncanny sense of what was to come. But seeing the Night Seer\u2019s path, more vividly than he himself had ever managed, shocked Ozols. She shredded her white robes and dyed them black. The symbols of power she\u2019d once daubed in blood, she bleached again with the light from the corrupted moon, enriching her affinity for Dark Sight. She tied the scraps around her weapons, sure reminders to keep her path true. Relying on her heightened perception, familiarity with Dark Sight, and uncanny foresight, Ozols now pursues the Night of the Hunter and any who would work towards their goals. In turn, the Night Seer feels the threat of there being one with greater power than himself, and knows that his prophecy will not come true if another has witnessed it.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle.

At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During a war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival.

First Class Trouble is a party game where players must work together and against each other to survive a disaster. Whether you play as one of the human Residents or the rebellious Personoids, you will have to use your wit (and the occasional flying champagne bottle) to stay alive. In First Class Trouble you either deceive or deduce your way to victory in a charming, yet unsettling and often mischievous environment. Whether you do it sober or with a slight buzz, First Class Trouble will serve you a dangerous cocktail of difficult decisions and whacky possibilities. The goal is to shut down the Central Artificial Intelligence Network, also known as CAIN, of the luxurious intergalactic cruise ship ISS Alithea before it and its loyal Personoids take control of the ship. Two Roles: Trust and Deceive Resident Gameplay Collect information about the passengers and deduce who you can trust and who to avoid. Collaborate with your fellow residents to eliminate the suspected Personoids before engaging in the shutdown of CAIN. Personoid Gameplay Lie, disrupt and deceive your way through the ship among the residents to either reach CAIN and unleash its full potential or kill off the remaining residents to secure control of the vessel. Use your unique skills to communicate and navigate the ship in the shadows and kill off residents when they pose a threat to your identity. Additional Features: \u2022 Character & Vruumba Customization - Aboard the ISS Alithea, the customization possibilities are endless. Shop for new clothes and accessories in the onboard mall using your hard-earned Infinity Coins. Use your spare cash to pimp that Vruumba (Trademark not pending) of yours! \u2022 Endless Kill Scenarios - The ISS Alithea is the ultimate playground for happy accidents. Explore new ways to eliminate both friend and foe in each level. Environmental hazards such as fires, bad wiring and poorly hanging chandeliers can all be used to get rid of your fellow passengers when you find it convenient. \u2022 Physicalized Interactions & Items - Interact with your fellow residents and personoids in unlimited, physicalized ways. Whack your friend to the end of the pool with the racket or simply nudge that foe into the fire and look away for a while. \u2022 Enhance social deduction and interactions through in-game proximity based voice chat, ingame text chat and emote wheel functionality \u2022 Several levels with unique themes and styles, along with items & interactions specific for them \u2022 6 player multiplayer If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

This classic platformer, updated for PlayStation®4, features more rangs, more vehicles, more bots, and more EVERYTHING... in an open world Aussie Adventure. Throw boomerangs, bite, smash and glide your way around the Australian Outback and stop the evil plans of the wicked Boss Cass and help the good folk of the little country town of BURRAMUDGEE. This sequel to the popular TY the Tasmanian Tiger is a game on a grander scale. In addition to classic platforming elements, you'll fight Aussie bush fires from a helicopter, drive around Southern Rivers while hanging on to the back of a four-wheel drive and use the bots to defeat enemies and solve puzzles - all while trying to find a variety of different collectables.

CASS was banished for his crimes, and the land was made safe once again. All thanks to the true blue Aussie hero, TY the Tasmanian Tiger, and his friends at BUSH RESCUE.

Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death. To survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.

Will you push to stay ahead of the other agencies, or focus on testing and research? There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet? Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies? Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You'll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars. Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors. Launching a payload into space is only the first step. In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment. These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue? Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We\u2019ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios.","SaleStarted":"2023-03-14","LowestPrice":"/game/85154","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png?w=200","MainStory":12,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5277-CUSA18418_00-0000000000000000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gqbz8C8bX0","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":92,"genre":"Strategy","PlusPrice":56.76,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/0117/CI6c4X9YcFeSbDwC2PmVEp7n.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Mars Horizon","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"THE IRREGULAR CORPORATION LTD.","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-17","Slug":"mars-horizon-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":172,"MainExtra":34,"SalePrice":56.76,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-03-29","description":"Rollercoaster Darkness - Ultimate Shooter Edition is an amazing adventure where action is ubiquitous!

Weapons in hand, they\u2019re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched. Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel. You take a moment to consider. You\u2019ve been here before. So many times. Maybe this time it will actually mean something. SUPERHOT VR Decisive winner of dozens of VR Game of the Year awards, SUPERHOT VR is a title reimagined and redesigned from the ground up for VR and hand tracking controllers. The fruit of over three years of close cooperation between the critically acclaimed SUPERHOT Team and Oculus, SUPERHOT VR brings the intensely visceral action of SUPERHOT directly into your head and soul. And now \u2013 directly into your VR headset too. The game will test your limits. It will bring pain \u2013 of the good kind. In the end you will prevail. You will be one with the system.","SaleStarted":"2023-03-14","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2477-CUSA18510_00-7827683902308671","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action","PlusPrice":118.75,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"THE COMPLETE SUPERHOT BUNDLE","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Superhot","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-16","Slug":"the-complete-superhot-bundle-playstation-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":475,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":142.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-03-29","description":"WHO\u2019S THE BOSS?
