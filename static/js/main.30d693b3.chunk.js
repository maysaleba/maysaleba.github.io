Now, millions of miles away from home, a micrometeoroid storm damaged your spaceship and killed two vital members of your crew. The mission is no longer just discovery, but to survive the journey with those still left alive. Tharsis is built around a unique mix of a board game and video game mechanics. The outcomes of your choices are determined by rolls of the dice, but ultimately it is up to you and your decisions that will affect the mission\u2019s success. Guide your crew through onboard disasters, food shortages, and the unforgiving nature of space. Maintain what remains of their health and sanity as they are strained by a crumbling ship, lack of food and the strange and disturbing signals coming from the Red Planet. Succeeding in Tharsis requires you to make the best of what you have, even if everything indicates failure. Certain factors may be outside of your control, but that doesn\'t mean they can\'t be overcome. Be ready to plan and adapt continually.

But since then, they remained silent. Now they need to hear our calls. Divine Ascent is a single and local-multiplayer strategy-puzzle game. The goal is to be the first to build towers, and to reach their tops to place temples. Six of the biggest civilizations of the ancient times compete against each other, to be the one taken by the gods to the heavens. To this end, they\'ve elected builders whose sole purpose is to erect monuments as high in the sky as possible. Key Features: Arena (local-multiplayer) and Puzzles (single player) modes Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels for two to six players (humans or A.I.) Single player mode contains 30 puzzles with increasing difficulty, plus the final stage which is sort of an Arena level against 5 opponents Special moves Tile-based isometric 3D graphics Each civilization has its own theme and atmospheric background sound design Game mechanics: The game is turn-based, in a board game style. The goal is to be the first to place three temples. A temple appears when you place a pawn on a tower five pieces high, or three pieces high in puzzle mode.

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.

Barely.<br /><br />Take on the role of a powerful leader and mystic. Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents.<br /><br />You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt?<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it\'s heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.<br /><br />During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands.<br /><br />If you\'re lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.<br /><br />You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode.<br /><br />Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you\'re wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.<br /><br />Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.<br /><br />In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.<br /><br />If you can survive long enough to find it.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"NO MORE ROBOTS","ReleaseDate":"2020-07-30","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/2309/XEozUpmOCdLB940sqK9hCvS5.png?w=200","Slug":"nowhere-prophet-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4256-CUSA19107_00-NOWHEREPROPHETUS","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IadayVADjTw","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"40%","Price":24.99,"genre":"Role-Playing,Strategy","SalePrice":14.99,"PlusPrice":14.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"85","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/55163/resident-evil-village-playstation","SaleEnds":"2022-03-03 07:59:00","Title":"Resident Evil Village","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-02-16 09:10:29","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4 version and the digital PS5 version of this game.<br /><br />Experience survival horror like never before in the eighth major installment in the storied Resident Evil franchise - Resident Evil Village.<br /><br />Set a few years after the horrifying events in the critically acclaimed Resident Evil 7 biohazard, the all-new storyline begins with Ethan Winters and his wife Mia living peacefully in a new location, free from their past nightmares.

Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages.<br /><br />The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible.<br /><br />Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences.<br /><br />As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent.

A fierce brawl commenced and Marty lost his right arm \u2013 but at least the demon also lost his head. Unfortunately, whilst the brawl erupted more demons entered his garage and stole his last batch of limited edition Walrus Ale (tm). Now Marty has become furious! He ripped off the demon\'s arm and did some DIY to re-attach his arm back to himself. This demon is no looker but gee it casts some nasty fireballs. Marty\'s (after)life now has a single purpose: Go to hell and get his beer back!  \\\\m/<br /><br />Remote Play","ESRBRating":"ESRB Mature","Publisher":"Headup Games GmbH & Co.

Sheltered is a world where death is permanent.<br /><br />Combat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you try to turn the cold and cramped Shelter into a home. And as they cling desperately to life, you must send family members from the scant protection of the shelter, outside into the dangerous, desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies. You\'ll come across abandoned towns, roaming factions and feral beasts.<br /><br />How you handle the many moral choices you\'ll encounter could be the difference between the family surviving or dying.

Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.<br /><br />As with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island.<br /><br />Nature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Merge Games Limited","ReleaseDate":"2019-07-30","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307q3DKnRbVRguZntUwA90V0Xpj_BaD9RmoQURl7fcykl0UpKC_E1_YhD3KvFezWNEO-4Q1VmsAp3I200JL3BlTWEUW2Hc.png?w=200","Slug":"solo-islands-of-the-heart-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1260-CUSA14666_00-SOLO000000000001","platform":"Playstation","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"PercentOff":"75%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Role-Playing,Platformer,Adventure","SalePrice":4.99,"PlusPrice":3.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-03-03 07:59:00","Title":"Sonic Colours: Ultimate - Digital Deluxe","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-02-16 09:10:17","description":"The evil Dr. Eggman has built an interstellar amusement park \u2013 but he\'s powering it with a captured alien race called \u201cWisps.\u201d Use Sonic\'s speed to free the Wisps and gain their amazing powers as you explore six unique worlds, filled with hurdles to overcome.
