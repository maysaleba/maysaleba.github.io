83,2023-09-13,"December 2021, Tokyo district court. Akihiro Ehara stands accused of groping a woman on a crowded train. A bystander’s video footage of his attempt to flee the scene and subsequent apprehension is all over the news, and public outcry demands a maximum sentence. “Three days ago, a dead body was found in an abandoned building in Yokohama. Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room. His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further. How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice? From just a single stumble, one can become a monster… LAW AND DISORDER - Lost Judgment once again puts players in the sneakers of lawyer turned street-fighting detective Takayuki Yagami. Joined by his partner, ex-yazuka Masaharu Kaito, the crime-fighting duo is called on to investigate a seemingly perfect crime whose lead suspect has an airtight alibi. What starts out as a tale of revenge reveals a tangled web of conspiracy involving several unlikely factions taking advantage of a broken law system. But as victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, he must choose between defending the law or exacting justice. FREEFORM COMBAT - Yagami’s distinct martial arts forms grant him mastery of any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Harness Crane, Tiger, and the new Snake stance, a graceful style that can deflect and return an opponent's strikes, using their energy against them. INVESTIGATIVE ACTION - Yagami’s arsenal of detective tricks grows with new gadgets, stealthily tracking suspects, and crafty methods of infiltration. Leave no stone unturned in pursuit of the truth. NO PLACE FINER – Immerse yourself in the bustling downtowns of Tokyo and Yokohama at your own pace within an authentic setting that only the RGG Studio can deliver.

In this award-winning cinematic action-thriller, troubled author Alan Wake embarks on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice. Following her mysterious disappearance from the Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, he discovers pages of a horror story he has supposedly written, but he has no memory of. Wake is soon forced to question his sanity, as page by page, the story comes true before his eyes: a hostile presence of supernatural darkness is taking over everyone it finds, turning them against him. He has no choice but to confront the forces of darkness armed only with his flashlight, a handgun and what remains of his shredded mind. His nightmarish journey to find answers to the mind-bending mystery he faces will lead him into the terrifying depths of the night. Alan Wake Remastered offers the complete experience, with the main game and its two story expansions - The Signal and The Writer - in stunning new 4K visuals. The tense, episodic story is packed with unexpected twists, heart-stopping cliff hangers, and intense bursts of combat where it takes more than bullets to banish the darkness.

The controllable team and objectives – e.g. win the overall classification, score more points in mountain stages – differ based on the race. NEW: RACE INCIDENTS You can now choose to enable or disable race incidents and their consequences. If you enable them (for yourself and your opponents or just your opponents), you can choose their frequency and enable or disable their consequences, which vary depending on the incident's severity: loss of power for a short or long duration, or even withdrawal. Be prepared to adapt because your strategy might need to be completely re-evaluated at any moment. NEW: RACE PREPARATION To add more unpredictability to races, a new preparation system has been added. Five random cyclists (from your team or in the peloton) will be especially well prepared for the race and five others may potentially underperform. Unfortunately, you can't know who these cyclists will be… You will need to keep an eye on all your opponents.

68,2023-09-13,"Daydreamer: Awakened Edition is the story of the last human who rouses from an eternal sleep to an unfamiliar Earth. Aliens took over the planet thousands of years ago, and the nameless protagonist was kept in a stasis chamber as a twisted relic to memorialize their victory. However, the mysterious Immortal Gate Keeper liberates her and sets her on a dangerous expedition to the Earth’s core. Be warned though—the aliens will do whatever it takes to get their trophy back, and the Earth is filled with frightening creatures that hunger for human flesh. Shoot your way through the hauntingly beautiful remains of Earth. Created by Roland Studios, a one-man indie development house, Daydreamer is a homage to 16-bit era side-scrolling shooters. Coupled with strategic platforming, high intensity battles, and pets that aid in combat, you wouldn’t want to wake up from this dream.

Step into your own fully immersive throne room with Crusader Kings: Royal Court, and get ready to impress vassals and courtiers with your splendor and treasure on display. Watch visitors pay respect or family members squabble as you pass judgment in royal audiences, establishing the vital link between your people and your realm. In Crusader Kings: Royal Court, you can commission great works of art from inspired craftspeople. Impress your rivals with the grandeur of your court, or awe them with your noble house’s heirlooms and relics. An enhanced Culture system lets you guide your people to novel cultural understandings as they merge or splinter off, embrace their heritage, learn languages, or acquire new traditions. A Royal Court on display ? As King or Emperor, watch as your personal throne room comes to life with the vast range of drama and intrigue of your court. Step into a fully 3D realized space, available in one of four major cultural visual styles, and fill it with regalia and majesty. ? Harsh or benevolent, pass judgment on those seeking arbitration. Hold court and watch as your courtiers scheme and vie for your attention. ? Match yourself against your greatest rival with your court’s grandeur. Or fail to impress them and suffer the sad diplomatic consequences of bad taste. A true treasure ? Show off your exquisitely crafted relics, or focus on your noble house’s history with your family heirlooms. A whole range of new artifacts can be admired in the series’ return of the inventory system. ? Talented craftspeople, from jewelers to weavers, can be employed on special projects, adding even more unique items to your domain. ? Commission special great works of art or win artifacts in battle. Be careful, as they can just as easily be lost in a botched duel or rival’s scheme. Culture and the people ? A greatly overhauled Culture system lies ready at your fingertips. Major new Cultural Traditions allow you to significantly change the way you play, from choosing the right benefits due to your realm’s terrain to giving your military new bonuses. Determine your heritage through Cultural Pillars or have your subjects learn new languages. ? Create a truly dynamic melting pot through the new Hybridisation feature, mixing and matching the defining traits of your people into a unique cultural fusion. Become a great Bedouin conqueror who merges with freshly subjugated people or follow the adventurous Norse ruler who came to adopt the local Sri Lankan ways. ? Witness your realm’s culture evolve with the new Divergence feature, with the hands of time subtly transform a single cultural strand into smaller sub-cultures.

Become Sherlock Holmes, and find yourself at the heart of the terrifying Cthulhu Mythos as you investigate a series of mysterious disappearances in Europe and the US. A Lovecraft meets Sherlock Holmes crossover, The Awakened puts you up against the legendary Cthulhu Mythos.

The Voice of Cards Trilogy bundles together all three titles from the series; Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars, Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden and Voice of Cards: The Beasts of Burden. The titles in the Voice of Cards series are styled as a tabletop card game adventure, as if you are there at the table, talking to the game master as you play through a fantastical journey. During your adventure you will encounter sudden, random events, be faced with difficult decisions and occasionally win or lose battles with the roll of a die. Overcome all of these and many more fiendish challenges as you follow intriguing stories of heroes and villains to their conclusions. This product contains all three games in the series, and although they share a setting and atmosphere, the three stories are not related directly, so can be played in any order.

,2023-09-13,"Tortuga - a Pirate’s Tale tells the journey of a pirate captain with a lust for gold and glory who assumes command of a fleet of pirate ships to strike the Caribbean. He progresses on his journey, raiding trading convoys, upgrading the ships and, of course, always keeping an eye on the morale of the crew. While doing so, he tries to persuade fellow pirate captains to join his fleet, all with with their own ships and individual abilities. With even bigger prizes in his sights, he will not stop until he is undisputedly the greatest pirate of the Caribbean. BECOME THE PIRATE OF ALL PIRATES • You are not born a great pirate, but we give you the tools to make you THE great pirate. Customize your own Flag under which your fleet will sail. As you gain experience, your notoriety and skills will improve. Roleplay with more than 35 distinct pirate’s skills on your way to claim your pirate throne. RAID AND VOYAGE THE CARIBBEAN SEA • The Caribbean of the 17th century is dominated by the four colonial powers of the Old World. Being a pirate is not your fault, but it is your responsibility! Take action to relieve the Spanish, Dutch, French and English colonies from their burden of drowning in riches. But be wary! Unless you are sure you are the biggest fish in the sea, don’t venture out too early or too far from your trusted hometown port. ENGAGE IN TACTICAL NAVAL BATTLES • A ship is safe in a harbor, but that’s not what ships are made for. Fight in tactical turn-based naval battles on a hexagonal grid of epic proportions. Use your wits when raiding a convoy or a settlement. Victory is determined by a clever combination of your ship’s distinct armament with the varying and rough conditions of the sea. UPGRADE YOUR FLEET • It is your job to maintain and upkeep a formidable fleet before facing the cannon hail of those mighty warships lurking in the seas. Combining distinct upgrades of your ship’s basic gear, such as weaponry, hull, mast, or figurehead allows for more than 360 unique loadouts. MEET YOUR CREW’S NEEDS • As an elected captain of the ship, it is your responsibility to split the spoils and riches with your crew. Agreeing on so-called ‘articles of capture’ clearly define the objectives you embark on before leaving port. Remember the whispers of mutiny below the decks can lead to nasty outcome. After all, you are an elected captain and not placed by the grace of the Lord. PARLEY WITH INFAMOUS PIRATE LEGENDS • On your journey to become the most fearsome, most glorious pirate captain, you will have the opportunity to get to know several historic pirates. Choose your foes and companions wisely… COMMAND HISTORICAL SHIPS • Featuring 18 unique types of ships such as Ship of the Line, Frigate, War Galleon and many more. DROWN IN QUESTS • Sink more than 25 hours into stories set in the Golden Age of Piracy. The world is your oyster after all. Governors and fellow pirate companion provide you with valuable questlines where a few doubloons can be made. Also don’t forget to seek out the local tavern and eavesdrop on the latest rumors.

As the Captain of a Genesis starship, you journey into uncharted space on the ultimate mission. Build and manage a space vessel, farm resources, deal with terrifying alien infestations, clone creatures and explore a vast, randomly generated universe. Go Rogue Huge, randomised galaxies ensure every run in Genesis Alpha One is unique. Choose one of three difficulties or tailor the game to your playstyle with the Custom Game Mode.

In Solo mode, you can now deal with incidents (injuries, illnesses) during the 92 stages available. BECOME A LEGEND In Tour de France 2022, you can create your own cyclist in Pro Leader mode. Choose your profile (climber, sprinter, puncher or versatile) and become a future winner of the Grande Boucle or a specialist of the great classics! Take control of a team in Pro Team mode! You start at the lowest levels and must prove yourself to receive invitations from organizers to high-profile races. Create your own tour with My Tour mode and the 92 stages available. Choose teams, rest days and stages to build your own unique tour. NEW FEATURES - New online mode with leaderboard - Race incidents (falls, illnesses…) - New preparation system - New interface on cobbled sections - More intense races with a more aggressive peloton and more collaborative breakaways - All 21 official stages of the Tour de France 2022 - New Primavera Classic inspired by a major Italian race - 3 new teams: Eolo-Kometa Cycling Team, Caja Rural-Seguros RGA and Uno-X Pro Cycling Team- NEW ONLINE MODE: RACE OF THE WEEK Enjoy a new challenge each week, competing against players from all over the world as you try to reach the top of the leaderboard! The controllable team and objectives – e.g. win the overall classification, score more points in mountain stages – differ based on the race. NEW: RACE INCIDENTS You can now choose to enable or disable race incidents and their consequences. If you enable them (for yourself and your opponents or just your opponents), you can choose their frequency and enable or disable their consequences, which vary depending on the incident's severity: loss of power for a short or long duration, or even withdrawal. Be prepared to adapt because your strategy might need to be completely re-evaluated at any moment. NEW: RACE PREPARATION To add more unpredictability to races, a new preparation system has been added. Five random cyclists (from your team or in the peloton) will be especially well prepared for the race and five others may potentially underperform. Unfortunately, you can't know who these cyclists will be… You will need to keep an eye on all your opponents. OTHER IMPROVEMENTS To make the cobbled sections of races more immersive, we have added shuddering to the entire user interface. This new feature reflects the difficulty of cobbled sections. You have never experienced the Arenberg trench quite like this! In Tour de France 2022, the races are more intense than ever, with even bigger early breakaways and better collaboration in all breakaways.

When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure.

Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be.

And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades.

A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really?

Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.",2023-08-29,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/oiWObCmIi2HWJ2AUnHfc7P7a.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCODELUXE000000,,35%,,"Action, Adventure",172.5,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/0714/oiWObCmIi2HWJ2AUnHfc7P7a.png,,Sherlock Holmes Chapter One Deluxe Edition,TRD,FROGWARES IRELAND LTD,2021-11-15,sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-deluxe-edition-ps4&ps5-tr,,1,575,,373.75,1

,2023-09-13,"El Hijo - A Wild West Tale is an exciting spaghetti-western stealth game, in which you guide a young boy on his quest to find his mother. As a six-year-old, “El Hijo” must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins, when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him. However, the place doesn’t feel right and he plans his escape. “El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child. Using the shadows to his advantage is the core element of the game, as “El Hijo” will often have to hide. Without needlessly adding new mechanics, the gameplay is extended naturally, as variations of existing mechanics are gradually introduced and then combined to increase the challenge. These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that “El Hijo” must traverse to reach his ultimate goal. - Survive the Wild West through the cleverness of a young hero - Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world - Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless - Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles - Use an arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes - Inspire other children to join you on the path to freedom - Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother",2023-08-29,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/WYjKQ407XRGoyRypUoBZTrPI.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4539-CUSA17029_00-BASEGAME00000000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFAcJW-05Hg,30%,,Unique,0,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1019/WYjKQ407XRGoyRypUoBZTrPI.png,,El Hijo - A Wild West Tale,TRD,www.handy-games.com GmbH,2021-03-25,el-hijo--a-wild-west-tale-ps4-tr,,0,359,,251.3,1

This bundle contains SUPERHOT - the award-winning first-person shooter in which time moves only when you move, SUPERHOT VR - the absolute must-play staple of virtual reality, and SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE – the followup non-VR title painstakingly created over three years of grueling production to satisfy your intense need for more SUPERHOT. Getting all games in this one neat bundle will let you experience hours upon hours of SUPERHOT’s tight, cinematic ballets of slow-motion mayhem. Immerse yourself in the brutalist, concrete world of SUPERHOT. Bullets wheezing past you from every direction, enemies surrounding you on all sides, shards of brilliant red crystal coating the concrete floor around you - you can easily lose yourself in this world. You can be truly free. SUPERHOT Blurring the lines between cautious strategy and unbridled mayhem, SUPERHOT is the FPS in which time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets. SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE Built on the foundations of SUPERHOT and SUPERHOT VR, MIND CONTROL DELETE continues to bring you more of SUPERHOT’s signature power fantasy. You stand in the center of a firefight. A hail of slow motion bullets is inching slowly towards your face. You see bright red enemies frozen in place as they run towards you. Weapons in hand, they’re stepping over the shattered remains of the foes you just dispatched. Everything is sharp, silent, and still. Light flickers across the red crystal shards coating the cold concrete floor. A gun slowly spins as it arcs through the air. The weapon dropped by an enemy as their dying body exploded in a shower of brilliant red shrapnel. You take a moment to consider. You’ve been here before. So many times. Maybe this time it will actually mean something. SUPERHOT VR Decisive winner of dozens of VR Game of the Year awards, SUPERHOT VR is a title reimagined and redesigned from the ground up for VR and hand tracking controllers. The fruit of over three years of close cooperation between the critically acclaimed SUPERHOT Team and Oculus, SUPERHOT VR brings the intensely visceral action of SUPERHOT directly into your head and soul. And now – directly into your VR headset too. The game will test your limits. It will bring pain – of the good kind. In the end you will prevail. You will be one with the system.",2023-08-29,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2477-CUSA18510_00-7827683902308671,,30%,,Action,359.6,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202005/0719/6QswyYdPnJiLRInRyFqr2nQW.png,,THE COMPLETE SUPERHOT BUNDLE,TRD,Superhot,2020-07-16,the-complete-superhot-bundle-ps4-tr,,0,899,,629.3,1
