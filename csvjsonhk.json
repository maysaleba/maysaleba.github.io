It's been almost a year since Yuu saw her last, having escaped his dreary home town to study in the bustling city, but with the advent of New Year's he finds himself obliged to return to his family to celebrate. Unfortunately, Yuu's absence has not softened his younger sister, and Otoko is just as sullen and surly as ever before.<br /><br />Finding the atmosphere at home unbearable, Yuu decides to escape once more — not to the city this time, but to his grandmother's snowy, secluded village. The reunion between grandson and grandmother starts normally at first… until one moonlit night, when the pair witness a star streaking through the sky.<br /><br />The following morning, Yuu enters the kitchen, still half-asleep, to discover...<br /><br />...that his grandmother has transformed into a cute young girl!<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Read through a compelling narrative of around 50,000 words.<br />• Enjoy detailed backgrounds and character art.<br />• Get immersed with a custom soundtrack.<br />• Experience a kinetic story with no choices or branches.<br />• Meet a very cute grandmother!<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

        "Desc": "※The items offered in this pack can be purchased as a single item.<br /><br />Days Gone Digital Deluxe Edition includes:<br />- Days Gone Digital Full Game<br />- Digital Original Music<br />- Days Gone Digital Mini-Art Book* by Dark Horse Comics<br />- Days Gone PS4 Dynamic Theme<br />- Monkey Wrench Skill Early Unlock<br />- 3 Bike Skins<br /><br />*The art book contains spoilers to the Days Gone story mode. We here at Bend Studio recommend playing through the story mode before viewing the art book.<br /><br />Days Gone is an open-world action-adventure game set in a harsh wilderness two years after a devastating global pandemic. Play as Deacon St. John, a drifter and bounty hunter who rides the broken road, fighting to survive while searching for a reason to live. <br />•Harsh Open World: Using the power of PlayStation4 and Unreal Engine 4, Days Gone offers an incredibly realistic and detailed open-world experience. Immerse yourself in vast and hostile environments, and explore their secrets. Search abandoned vehicles, houses, truck stops and towns as you scavenge for resources. But be careful— day and night cycles, along with dynamic weather systems, all affect gameplay and enemy behavior. <br />•Brutal Sandbox Combat: Perfect your gameplay with an endless combination of strategy and play in every situation. Craft customized items using pieces and parts found in the field, from brutal melee weapons to traps and more. Act wisely, as every choice can be the difference between life and death.<br />•Unique Enemies: In addition to human drifters, marauders and militia, Deacon must face a wilderness overrun by Freakers— mindless, feral creatures. Although more animal than human, Freakers are smart and quickly evolving. As with any living creature, they have needs, habits, and behaviors that Deacon must learn and adjust to. <br />•Unique Setting: Adapt to quick environmental changes inspired by the harsh high-desert of the Pacific Northwest. One minute, Deacon is riding through a dense alpine forest—or snow field or lush meadow— and the next, he's fighting his way through harsh desert lava fields and caves. Ancient lava flows scar and define the hazardous environments, delivering a breathtaking and diverse backdrop of regions to explore. From small towns and mountains to cliffs and river basins, explore the beautiful but threatening world, left in the wake of humanity's destruction.<br />•Compelling Story: At its core, Days Gone is about survivors and what makes them human: desperation, loss, madness, betrayal, friendship, brotherhood, regret, love— and hope. It's about how, even when confronted with such enormous tragedy, hope never dies.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

You play as BK, a hole-driving raccoon who swallows up his friends and their homes to earn idiotic prizes.<br /><br />When BK falls into one of his own holes, he's confronted by his best friend Mira and the residents of Donut County, who are all stuck 999 feet underground… and they demand answers!<br /><br />The Hole Keeps Growing<br />• EXPLORE every character's home, each with their own unique environment.<br />• MOVE the hole to swallow up their stuff, growing bigger each time.<br />• COMBINE objects inside for crazy effects: cook soup, breed bunnies, launch fireworks, and more.<br />• CATAPULT things back out of the hole. You can use it to solve puzzles...or just destroy stuff.<br />• DEVOUR everything. The hole won't stop until the whole county is all gone.<br /><br />Donut County was created by Ben Esposito, designer on What Remains of Edith Finch and The Unfinished Swan. It is the result of six years of solo development, dozens of donuts (for research), and one fateful encounter with a raccoon.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

        "Desc": "From Santa Monica Studio and creative director Cory Barlog comes a new beginning for one of gaming's most recognizable icons. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.<br /><br />• Bold New Beginning — His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. <br />• A Second Chance — Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.<br />• A Darker, More Elemental World — From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War's breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise.<br />• Vicious, Physical Combat — With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.<br />  WARNING: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS MATERIAL WHICH MAY OFFEND AND MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED, CIRCULATED, SOLD, HIRED, GIVEN, LENT, SHOWN, PLAYED OR PROJECTED TO A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS",

        "Desc": "※The items offered in this pack can be purchased as a single item.<br /><br />The Digital Deluxe Edition contains:<br />· God of War digital full game<br />· Death's Vow Armor Set<br />· Exile's Guardian Shield<br />· Digital Dark Horse Comic<br />· Digital Dark Horse Artbook<br />· Dynamic Theme<br /><br />From Santa Monica Studio and creative director Cory Barlog comes a new beginning for one of gaming's most recognizable icons. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.<br /><br />• Bold New Beginning — His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. <br />• A Second Chance — Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.<br />• A Darker, More Elemental World — From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War's breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise.<br />• Vicious, Physical Combat — With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

As an unpaid intern in the dystopian city of Neo-Cascadia, you'll wield office junk as weaponry as you make your way through the offbeat procedural dungeons beneath your company campus.<br /><br />[The Future is Wack]<br />Failed businesses no longer just cease to exist--they sink beneath the earth, and their employees are cursed to wander the halls for eternity as monsters. It's your duty to put these monsters out of their misery and repossess their assets--so that your boss can afford a new car, or something.<br /><br />[Not All Heroes Get Paychecks]<br />Battle through the remains of failed startups themed off of gig workers, dating sites, and cryptocurrency.

Make friends with your co-workers! Hire a freelance goblin! Date a slime! Invest in crypto! Set a rideshare on fire!<br /><br />[Fight Flexibly]<br />In the dungeons of Going Under, almost everything can be used as a weapon, from laptops to brooms to body pillows. Proper weapons can be found as well, but even they can break at a moment's notice if you aren't careful. Playing cautiously and picking the right weapon for the situation are musts if you intend on surviving your internship.<br /><br />[Horrible Bosses]<br />And you thought your boss was a monster. At the bottom of the dungeons lurk the founders of the cursed startups, getting rich off of investments while their employees fight amongst themselves. Defeat them and return to the surface with their enchanted relics to empower the company you work for.<br /><br />[Get Paid in Experience]<br />As you explore, you'll encounter powerful Skills that change the way you play. Learn them at the Cafe and they'll show up in future runs. Use a Skill often enough, and you'll get it “endorsed” and available to start your expeditions with. Combine multiple Skills for crazy synergies, and you'll be cleaning house in no time.<br /><br />[A World of Characters]<br />Complete Tasks for your co-workers to gain Clout with them and unlock their unique bonuses. Learn more about Neo-Cascadia, the origins of Fizzle, and how the drone shipping empire known as Cubicle came to dominate the city.

        "Desc": "At twilight in Kentucky, as bird songs give way to the choir of frogs and insects, familiar roads become strange, and it's easy to get lost. Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.<br /><br />KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.<br /><br />Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes,\" which were originally published separately, available now on PlayStation 4 for the first time.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

        "Desc": "In the Wild West, it takes a lot of luck just to stay alive. Fortunately in Luckslinger, good fortune is measurable, collectible and usable whenever you need it most. Kill bandits, steal their luck and use it for your own good. The more luck you have, the better chance you have that enemy bullets will miss, you get saved from a bad jump or better loot is dropped at your feet. But beware! When you don't have much luck built up in your special bracelet, bridges might collapse, rocks could tumble loose or outlaws might find a way to get the jump on you!<br /><br />Inspired by the unrealistically fast gunslingers, dark humor and greed-driven anti-heroes of spaghetti western classics, Luckslinger is an action-packed romp through the gritty frontier with a unique hip hop twist. Graffiti spraying, vinyl digging, slow drums and jazzy samples give this western a modern and slightly anachronistic flair all its own.<br /><br />The town of Clovercreek has been robbed blind! Six infamous criminals stole the town's precious luck charms and it's up to you to bring them back. You won't be alone, though. Aside from your lucky bracelet's abilities, you'll also have the aid of your feathered friend Duckbridge, distracting enemies for you and grabbing extra health items whenever his duck brain tells him to. Win the day and get paid the golden price for your troubles, because bounty hunters don't do charity work!<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Explore a pixel art rendition of the Wild West.<br />• Collect luck and use it to cheat death!<br />• Enjoy a hip hop soundtrack for a modern twist on spaghetti western aesthetics.<br />• Receive assistance from your sometimes trusty duck companion.<br />• Take down outlaws and save the town of Clovercreek from misfortune!<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Flow mechanics.

        "Desc": "Dive into a deep story of corruption, crime and intrigue. Take the role of gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd, and come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack reach his retirement with a nice stack of bills, or will he end up broken ... or worse?<br /><br />Manage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage.<br /><br />Choose your approach to each situation as it unfolds.

Collect dog-tags from vanquished enemies to upgrade your equipment between areas and look out for special weapons which will give you a momentary advantage.<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• A faithful port of the hit 16-bit game with added extras.<br />• Incredible pixel art.<br />• Intense FM chiptune soundtrack.<br />• Two difficulty levels and three modes of play.<br />• An arsenal of 10 weapons to master.<br />• Play solo or local co-op with a friend!<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",
