75,2023-07-05,"The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. STORY MODE The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episodes 1+2 were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - “DO NOT GO GENTLE” Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - “LUMINACE FUGUE” Mackenzie’s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? EPISODE THREE - CROSSROADS ELEGY In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? EPISODE FOUR - FURY, THEN SILENCE A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. SURVIVAL MODE Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes.

69,2023-07-05,"Before he was the world’s greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes was a brilliant rebel itching to prove himself. When an old wound compels him back to the Mediterranean shore where his mother died, it seems like the perfect opportunity to do just that—but beneath the vibrant urban veneer of the island, the rhythm of island life strikes a more ominous beat. Crime and corruption, a twisted sense of justice and morality... These are just a few stumbling-blocks in Sherlock’s quest for truth. As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.",2023-06-20,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5205-PPSA01978_00-SHCOFROGWARESUAK,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZXfOVX4J10,70%,,"Action, Adventure",134.7,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202103/1109/726FulA9CICxQyT6kgu19XaX.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/sherlock-holmes-chapter-one,Sherlock Holmes Chapter One,TRD,FROGWARES IRELAND LTD,2021-11-15,sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-ps4&ps5-tr,https://shope.ee/4Koz990JKk,1,449,,134.7,1

At the dawn of the 21st century, the conglomerate PROBE-NEXUS, commonly known as Probe, began reconstruction efforts in that eastern area. Colossal capital and cutting-edge technology was poured into rebuilding it. Skyscrapers that put the old high-rises to shame along with the world's biggest shopping mall and recreational facilities.

68,2023-07-05,"The once thriving Kingdom of Hermes has fallen to an age of calamity. Seen as the answer to all the kingdom’s ailments, alchemy became a widely used practice across the land, with denizens welcoming it into their homes, using it to enhance and heal as they saw fit. When the price of alchemy became too steep, attempts to halt its use were made, each as woefully unsuccessful as the last, with the catastrophic consequences felt across the realm. Within days, the kingdom fell to chaos, infected monsters prowling the blood-soaked streets, all hope of a cure lost. Corvus is the kingdom’s final hope, the fate of Hermes resting in his feathered hands. The truth is buried deep in the memories Corvus left scattered throughout the punishing world, and only by collecting these lost memories can the kingdom be saved, but each time he dives back in, trying to piece together the truth, all he finds is more secrets. Key Features Harness the plague: Seize plague weapons from gruesome bosses and formidable enemies, wielding them as deadly weapons. Giving enemies a taste of their own medicine will be the only way to survive the horrors that lurk in the shadows of the once thriving kingdom Embrace the Raven: Shift into your raven form during battle, throw feathers like daggers to interrupt your enemies’ attacks, and perform executions with the swiftness of a raptor. Fight your way: Upgrade and modify Corvus’ basic movements and plague weapons, build your very own playstyle, and prepare for the challenges that await in your own unique way.

68,2023-07-05,"A 3rd person, fixed-camera survival horror adventure. Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages. The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him – but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible. Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences. As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them – and death is permanent. If they die, you will have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so their deaths are not in vain. A mysterious antique shop, a forgotten abbey, an abandoned mental hospital... Each location in Song of Horror is inspired by the classics of the genre. Explore and investigate these haunted places to gather clues and items that will help you solve challenging puzzles while enduring the agonizing tension of the game's atmosphere.",2023-06-20,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/1308/IcgCV6RNmA3I0BUG4vIhQJca.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3792-CUSA20539_00-SONGOFHORROR0001,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDAkLOhQZsM,60%,,"Adventure, Horror",139.6,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/1308/IcgCV6RNmA3I0BUG4vIhQJca.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/song-of-horror,SONG OF HORROR,TRD,"RAISER GAMES, S.L.",2021-05-27,song-of-horror-ps4-tr,https://shope.ee/99uEuofvFY,0,349,,139.6,1

65,2023-07-05,"White Shadows is a cinematic puzzle-platformer where you play as a little Ravengirl trying to escape a brutal dystopia founded on oppression and violence that puts her at the bottom of its hierarchical social ladder. Composed of a vast network of towers rising from the void of post-catastrophe darkness into the sky above, the city our young adventurer seeks to escape is a dangerous place to be. She will have to find ways to avoid the teeth of machinery primed to grind her into dust, leap across rickety infrastructure that bridges the cavernous darkness all around and avoid the watchful eyes of guards ready to gun her down. She will travel to the city’s brightest highs and delve to its darkest depths on her journey, discovering her destiny among the last free people alive. White Shadows’ striking architectural forms and stunning monochrome art style combine to create a place steeped in atmosphere. It’s a world where the lies of the elite are plastered across its walls, where twisted forms of entertainment are used to keep everyone in their place, and where hope seems in short supply.

Thought to be dead, you emerge from exile 8 years later, the faceless man kindled by the flame and seeking vengeance.

With over 30 arrows to craft, experimentation is key to your success! Do you craft a smoke arrow to blind your opponent, or do you add on a poison element to create poisonious gas?

Unlocking its power piece by piece, his curiosity soon turned to obsession. Simply studying the tome wasn't enough. Before long, he used his findings to bring the very world to life. Trees, flowers, and mushrooms sprouted legs and maws, yearning for fresh meat. Wild animals were melded with humans and thrown into his labyrinth. The dead arose from the long-forgotten ruins. And in the city corrupted by gold, his tongue poisoned the king's ear. His obsession finally led to a tear in the veil - a portal to another place where untold horrors lurk. Now, they enter our world in droves, razing villages to the ground. These unimaginable events have brought together heroes from across the realm. Heroes like you. From this camp, we will push these creatures back to the beyond and defeat this irredeemable sorcerer. The ultimate tabletop game, unlike anything you have ever seen before!

,2023-07-05,"Expand your Jurassic World with the incredible Jurassic World Evolution 2: Feathered Species Pack. Featuring three land-dwelling dinosaurs and one flying reptile, these four new eye-catching prehistoric species all exhibit magnificent plumage, ranging from dense coverings to fine coats. Evolve your park like never before and give your guests an experience they won’t forget with these captivating feathered additions. This pack features: · Yutyrannus has a name that translates as ‘feathered tyrant’ due to it being one of the largest known feathered dinosaurs to eat meat. It has a striking nasal crest used for display purposes, and a light yet dense coat to provide insulation when the temperature drops. · Jeholopterus is an impressively quick and nimble flying reptile, and the smallest airborne species in the entire game. Palaeontologists have found only one specimen to date, but it ranks among the best preserved of any pterosaur, giving us a fascinating insight into its looks and behaviour. · Deinocheirus is one of the largest ornithomimosaurs ever discovered, with arms longer than those of any bipedal dinosaur. This distinctive prehistoric species, with its duck-like bill and broad hump on its back, cuts an intimidating figure, despite foraging exclusively on plants. · Sinosauropteryx, a small, meat-eating dinosaur covered with delicate, hair-like feathers and waving a striped tail. Sinosauropteryx works together to hunt in packs. It was discovered in 1996, and its ancient remains were the first to not only suggest the existence of feathered dinosaurs, but hint at their potential to have colouration.",2023-06-20,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1512/bcc3ed09c04f9607bbceccc3a1f7b3f0463ec4e8e7c18910.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2377-PPSA03286_00-FEATHEREDSPECIES,,30%,,"Simulation, Strategy",55.3,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/1512/bcc3ed09c04f9607bbceccc3a1f7b3f0463ec4e8e7c18910.png,,Jurassic World Evolution 2: Feathered Species Pack,TRD,FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC,2023-03-30,jurassic-world-evolution-2-feathered-species-pack-ps4&ps5-tr,,1,79,,55.3,1

,2023-07-05,"Welcome to Lifeless Estate, where the usual eerie silence has been interrupted by signs of undead life. The new lodgers are restless spirits, big on wailing and generous with the ectoplasm. No one knows how to die tastefully these days. Where's the subtlety? These are the dangers of jumping into anything, even death, uneducated. Haunted by unwelcome and undead spirits, the estate needs your help for a new lease on the afterlife. WHAT’S INCLUDED • A New Campus Location • 2 New Courses • 2 New Fully Animated Classrooms • 2 New Student Archetypes • A New Challenge Mode Level • And Lots Of New Items NEW LOCATION Lifeless Estate The lawn may be lacklustre, and the surfaces strangely gooey, but all of the problems come back to the ghosts. You could say that possession is nine tenths of its flaws. There, I've said it. The last heir to the estate, Lady Lifeless had hoped to spend her after-years catching up with her reading and floating tastefully around the garden. Instead, her rest is routinely ruined by rude spirits with even worse table-manners. Tackle the paranormal pest problem, learn what it means to be dead and help the estate rest, peacefully, once again. NEW COURSES Paranormal Detection There was debate in the County for a number of years, surrounding the existence of ghosts. Thanks to science, that debate is now long finished: ghosts are a real and genuine nuisance. You can't wipe away the regrets and resentment of vengeful spirits, but now you can bottle them up… a bit like they did. School Spirits Being dead isn't as easy as everyone makes it seem. It's hard to rest in peace with a life & death's worth of questions on your mind.

This modern take from the fine developers at Llamasoft combines the intrigue of an incredibly rare Atari arcade prototype with a unique creative vision that delivers a wave shooter that is insanely addictive. Akka Arrh drips with Minter’s sense of humor, love of psychedelic color, and ability to create games that are a joy to play. Key Features: Pure arcade bliss!

Start from the beginning of the 50 unique levels, or pick up where you left off to power through to the end. Accessibility! Sensitive to flashing lights or just not a fan?

,2023-07-05,"The Gods have abandoned Midgard. Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.",2023-06-20,/game/70710,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200,5,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6958-CUSA40870_00-0325134800455721,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqwwdGneIG4,50%,0,"Action, Adventure, Music/Rhythm",74.5,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png,,ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree,TRD,Untold Tales S.A.,2023-02-09,atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4-tr,,0,149,7,74.5,1

,2023-07-05,"Embark on a timeless journey through a sprawling cave system packed with treasures, creatures, mazes, and wits-defying puzzles. The great grandpappy of adventure games will test you and tickle your problem-solving skills as you unearth its plot and secrets. Through cunning trial-and-error you will crawl through tight squeezes, encounter impressive caverns, collect inventory, locate treasure, thwart dwarf attacks, all while keeping your eye on the score before your lamp goes out. Dust off your vintage Colossal Cave maps from the 70s or 80s, they'll still work like a charm. This is a faithful, unchanged tribute to the original game design. Developed in the mid-1970’s by amateur cave spelunker, this classic text-adventure was originally crafted as a way for a father to entertain his two young daughters. Will Crowther based his design on detailed cave maps he’d made with his wife, Patricia, of the Bedquilt section of Kentucky’s Mammoth cave. Family cave exploration is at the heart of this game. Shortly thereafter, the code-prankster, Don Woods, discovered the game on the ARPANET and expanded the cave. He layered in more fun, fantasy, puzzles, and a vexing 350-point system. Years later, Don’s expansion became the most accessible and the definitive version of Colossal Cave Adventure. Enter Roberta Williams. She first played the game in 1979 and was instantly hooked. She spent weeks playing the game, taking notes and mapping out the cave, as it was revealed through the textual descriptions in game. Her mind was filled with imaginary neon mushrooms, misty underground lakes, a snappy bivalve mollusk, and a noticeably absent giant. After finishing the game, and all 350 points achieved, she was ready for another adventure – a dilemma in 1979. If it was another adventure she wanted, she’d have to make her own... and, indeed she did. In 1980 she designed and developed the world’s first graphic computer game, Mystery House. This groundbreaking game is considered one of the most influential in history, establishing conventions that have become standard in the adventure game genre. It has been ported to just about every computer and console, played by millions, and inspired many other games, books, movies, and TV series. Relive the golden age of adventure gaming. Immerse yourself in a timeless exploration through a sprawling cave system filled with treasures, creatures, and brain-teasing puzzles. Transport back to a more innocent time and experience the retro-cool of point-and-click mechanics, accompanied by an art style that harkens back to the golden age of adventure games. This lovingly and respectfully assembled tribute is brought to you by boutique studio, Cygnus Entertainment. Ken and Roberta Williams are committed to sharing and preserving the spirit of classic adventure games. With its challenging and mind-bending puzzles, this explorative game will keep you enthralled.

,2023-07-05,"Paper Cut Mansion is a roguelite horror set in a papercraft world. Play as Toby, a police detective arriving at a mysterious old mansion. Explore the mansion floor by floor as you seek to unravel the story behind this bizarre place, with each run giving you the opportunity to collect another piece of evidence to be added onto your Evidence Board. The Mansion also hosts a mysterious cast of characters who may help or hinder your progress on each run... Features • Creepy and Thrilling storyline unfolds (pun intended) as you progress in the game and unlocks different endings depending on your performance • Game mechanics designed for high replayability • Perma-death • The more you fail and start over, the more you learn about the mechanics • Unique AI for each enemy type - unexpected behaviours - makes enemies creepier and more fearsome • Logical puzzles are designed to make the player think • Collectible Upgrades • Customize your equipment before each run to shape your own play style Run by run, Paper Cut Mansion will offer you the opportunity of defining your playstyle as you unlock new abilities and discover new equipment that will give you a better chance of overcoming the challenges each procedurally generated run throws at you. Each new item offers further customisation to your ultimate build, allowing for truly unique set ups. Do you want to get in close as a melee fighter or take shots from afar as a ranged marksman? Set yourself up with a drone who can do the fighting for you or create an engineering build who can lay down traps and turrets as you back enemies into them. Completing quests will also grant you temporary perks, making each run feel fresh as you may not get the same perks to choose from next time! The possibilities are endless and there is no correct way to overcome the ever-shifting procedural rooms of the mansion. The mansion itself also has a dimension-hopping twist. Each floor contains portals that lead you to alternate versions of the same location. Each dimension switches up the aesthetics and gameplay. You always start in the NeoCortex dimension, which plays out like an escape room, filled with challenges, puzzles and surprises. From there, you will receive quests that take you into the Reptilian Complex and the Limbic System Dimensions. In the Reptilian Complex, the mansion takes on a fiery appearance as it is overrun with monsters. The Limbic system sees an icy chill overtake the mansion. You’ll need to move quickly and stay near heat sources as the cold damages you on your search for hidden items or torches to light up. With a variety of enemies, clues, quests, secrets, loot and compelling logic puzzles scattered throughout the mansion, there is always something intriguing to discover on each run. There’s always something for you to keep track of - from kit upgrades, puzzles that need solving or quests to complete. Between each level a musical interlude will reveal more of the twisting story, with decisions you make throughout your run subtly affecting the final outcome - with 27 different possible endings wrapping up the tale. All this, combined with its incredible aesthetics, makes Paper Cut Mansion a roguelite you won’t want to miss.",2023-06-20,/game/112952,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/0809/Js4dKo2XYj1sdyw8t1hJhAcm.png?w=200,0,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5360-PPSA09516_00-PAPERCUTMANPS5EU,,40%,0,Horror,99.5,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/0809/Js4dKo2XYj1sdyw8t1hJhAcm.png,,Paper Cut Mansion,TRD,Thunderful Publishing AB,2022-12-05,paper-cut-mansion-ps4&ps5-tr,,1,199,0,119.4,1

RUNOUT is a dynamic runner-platformer with logical riddles in the setting of the future. Players always run, but when they collide with any obstacle, they turn in the opposite direction.

As the suspenseful story unfolds, find the culprit behind the sinister plot and ultimately save the world.

,2023-07-05,"Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. While you can try, in most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun.",2023-06-20,/game/89898,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png?w=200,10,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-GASSTATIONSIM0EU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQQbqDBpm_0,25%,25,Simulation,139.3,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1009/LsixXfeVD2EOR2eXSrh7r2Bx.png,,Gas Station Simulator,TRD,MD GAMES SA,2022-10-19,gas-station-simulator-ps4-tr,,0,199,13,149.25,1

,2023-07-05,"Strategic Mind: Fight for Freedom is a history-driven turn-based strategy set in World War 2. You will fight across Europe, Africa, and Burma. Will you choose to spend the time on proper reconnaissance before the attack, or rely on fast and aggressive tactics? Will you use nighttime or rain to your advantage, sneaking up on enemy positions, or just complain that the weather was unfavorable? Will you help the locals or leave them to their fate? Saving the stronghold of Democracy and Freedom in Europe from the totalitarian oppression of the Axis powers lies in your hands. Witness WW2 from two different perspectives: The British one features fully historical battles where you lead the British Army as Sir Harold Alexander. Take charge of the Dunkirk evacuation. Fight the Japanese in Burma, and Italians in Africa. Turn the tide of war against Germany at El Alamein. Bring the North Africa war to its end and lead the victorious landing in Italy in 1943. The US one has historical operations up to the defeat of Germany and also features a number of alternate history battles against the USSR afterward. Lead the US Army as General Dwight Eisenhower. Go all the way from D-Day landings to the fall of Berlin. Ensure the success of Operation Market Garden, repel the last German offensive at the Ardennes, and strike the killing blow into the heart of the Reich. Then move into the alternate history of 1946 and face your strongest adversary yet - the Red Army. Quests based on real historic events. Make sure all of your troops manage to escape the Dunkirk trap and conduct Operation Compass to show the Italian troops they should choose better allies. Possible alternate history flow - what would have happened if the Allies followed the ideas of Operation Unthinkable and went to war against the USSR in 1946? Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation. The tone of the interactions is affected by your choices. Advanced army manager - choose the composition of your forces. Acquire new units, upgrade or dismiss the outdated ones. Make sure that your forces have all the necessary tools for the upcoming battle. Real WW2 heroes - assign historical personalities to your armies and get access to special skills. Realistic 3D graphics - study the battle map and take advantage of 3D graphics, featuring volumetric terrain and physically-simulated movement of units.

Characterised by a lightweight frame, extremely sharp teeth, and flexible arms used for grabbing, Australovenator was perfectly built for stalking and running down prey.

,2023-07-05,"Survive, gather resources, expand your crew, improve your starship, and pave the way through outer space – full of hostile races. Your path will consist of difficult choices and everyone will have an influence on the outcome. …and perhaps you might be able to solve the mystery of this universe. FLYING AMONG THE STARS You are the commander of the “Melistar” (“The Star Bee”), and you have a swarm of intelligent anthropomorphic bees. Your ship is your home, and your mission is to keep an eye on its fighting ability to repel enemy attacks; to stay on course, and to effectively collect resources to ensure that both the Queen and soldier bees have enough food; and, of course, to keep an eye on the status of your crew, whose members strive to get into trouble or arrange it. OTHER SPECIES The ship travels through an amazing universe full of strange insectoid races. Who you’ll be forming an alliance with, and who you’ll be fighting with, is largely up to you! The Merchant Guild fights the League of Smugglers; the intelligent Ants compete with Locusts for space colonies; the sinister cult of Blood Suckers spreads across the galaxy... We’ll have to fight and trade – and every one of these decisions can be a turning point in the story. SURVIVAL AND STORYTELLING * You can try your hand at surviving. Space cycles alternate, resources run out – and the crew increases; but luck and accurate calculation are on your side! Competently upgrade your ship and set the right course – and you can stay alive for a certain amount of time, or maybe even break a record! * If you like branching plots and world exploration – boldly immerse yourself in the storyline. The CyberHive universe is a mysterious and deep setting. Collect ancient artifacts and pieces of knowledge on distant planets about the past – and discover how the world turned out to be and what misfortune it faces. Maybe you can avert it... or not. MANY EVENTS As you try to find resources and survive, you will experience many events on the ship: from intrigues within the crew and problems with passengers, to a large contraband “set-up” or a collision with the ghost of a legendary pirate starship. Some events form a story, and some occur randomly. But the choices within each event will also have to be considered... ...Subjects with the waist of a wasp and a deadly sting; predatory rivals and faction battles; exploring the farthest corners of the galaxy; dangerous challenges and responsible decisions. Welcome to the world of CyberHive!

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before. France, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. EXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other. ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL Use ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout.

Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation. TENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER Customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode. ENHANCED KILL CAM More realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.",2023-06-20,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2812/ikX07BwP4iCsfPrSnqfQQ4qs.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4529-PPSA04444_00-SNIPERELITE500DE,,50%,,"Fighting, Action",394.5,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2812/ikX07BwP4iCsfPrSnqfQQ4qs.png,,Sniper Elite 5 Deluxe Edition PS4™ & PS5™,TRD,REBELLION DEVELOPMENTS LTD,2022-05-25,sniper-elite-5-deluxe-edition-ps4--ps5-ps4&ps5-tr,,1,789,,394.5,1

BUILD A WONDROUS VIEW Build, install and redesign your station to perfection in a full 3D view taking advantage of the spectacular visuals provided by Unreal Engine 4. Look at your creation in a 360 degrees view, zooming in and out to marvel at its beauty. Look at the magnificent in-game star constellations, nebulas and planets the development team spent weeks researching to realistically provide in-game visualisations within the endless game sky. FOCUS ON THE ABSTRACT Monitor and set up production cycles, resources and their distribution. Focus either on efficiency or yield, treating everything as a diligent spreadsheet master - but with an abstract layout system resembling a circuit board to help you design the best connections, nooks and crannies to make your station a resounding engineering success! ECONOMICS, ERRORS AND MORE! A unique economic system provides you with a key objective - make your station efficient and profitable or fail! The normal route of business can be, however, disrupted by a number of disruptions: from hacker attacks to error and malfunctions each module and its system entail in your management of the station. Your production may also simply overload, given the production strain - so plan, execute and design to perfection! EXPLORE UNKNOWN PLANETS There are 3 distinct campaign missions where you need to terraform a given planet, make it habitable and easy to extract resources from.

Enjoy both the tried-and-true bullet hell experience of the original game and the added features of the twin-stick Over Power mode. You can even compete for high scores online for the very first time. In Rolling Gunner, you are humanity’s last hope in the defence against the now-sentient computer system BAC that is powering and controlling nearly all of the world’s engines and the planet’s population has been reduced by half. Take flight in the space craft RF-42R STORK which carries the Rolling Gun, a special weapon that was built in secret to fight against BAC in the event of a crisis. Rolling Gunner is a tough but rewarding bullet hell Shoot ‘em Up where precise play lets you climb the leaderboards. In addition, you can refine your skills in practice mode and save replays to truly analyse and master the game. Features: • Pick one of three STORK spaceships, each with unique attributes and firing patterns • Navigate across six stages blanketed in a hail of bullets from an unceasing onslaught of enemies and screen-filling bosses • Varied difficulty modes offer the best experience for every skill level • Climb the global online leaderboards and keep the challenge going, even after beating the highest difficulty • The Replay feature lets you analyze your last attempts and Training Mode helps you master the Rolling Gun and the different stages • Beautifully animated cutscenes and a superior, energetic soundtrack by COSIO marry the gameplay and story perfectly The Over Power DLC can best be described as a super expansion, turning the bullet-hell shooter into an even more frantic twin-stick shooter, with a new control scheme and even a new soundtrack, creating a completely different experience that can be selected from the main menu. The titular Rolling Gun can now be moved independently from the ship with the right stick to destroy enemies and projectiles with more precision and a buster beam gun and rechargeable plasma shield are added to the arsenal.

,2023-07-05,"Showcase an array of outstanding new prehistoric species with the Jurassic World Evolution 2: Camp Cretaceous Dinosaur Pack. Inspired by Universal Pictures, Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Animation’s hit Netflix show, Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous, this DLC features two entirely new dinosaurs, two new variants for existing species, and eight eye-catching skins that players can use to bring their parks to life. ? SCORPIOS REX One of Dr. Henry Wu’s first hybrid creations, the Scorpios Rex is a truly fearsome carnivore. Blood-red eyes, charcoal-black scales, prominent spikes, and jagged, uneven teeth characterise this impressive species. Known for its aggressive nature, it was originally deemed unfit for display…until now. MONOLOPHOSAURUS Named for the single crest adorning its skull, the Monolophosaurus is a medium-sized carnivore from the mid-Jurassic period. Its distinguished crest helps intensify roars and aids communication between Monolophosauruses. OURANOSAURUS (Variant) The Ouranosaurus is a peaceful herbivore that lives in large herds. Keeping a single Ouranosaurus is not advised, as lone individuals have been known to break out of their enclosures and panic guests. The Ouranosaurus has a broad snout and tall spines on its back supporting a camel-like hump. KENTROSAURUS (Variant) Despite being covered in lethal-looking spikes, the Kentrosaurus is actually a docile herbivore that uses its beak to bite off plant material. One of the smallest species of stegosaur, the Kentrosaurus defends itself when threatened using long spikes on each shoulder and smaller spikes protruding from its hips and tail. 8 NEW DINOSAUR SKINS Bring the Baryonyx trio Grim, Limbo and Chaos, plus Toro the Carnotaurus, Bumpy the Ankylosaurus, and Big Eatie the Tyrannosaurus Rex to life in your parks, and entrance your guests with two glow-in-the-dark skins inspired by the Parasaurolophus Lux. · 1 Ankylosaurus skin - Bumpy · 3 Baryonyx skins - Grim, Limbo, Chaos · 1 Carnotaurus skin - Toro · 2 Parasaurolophus Lux skins - Lux 1 (glow in the dark), Lux 2 (glow in the dark) · 1 Tyrannosaurus rex skin - Big Eatie",2023-06-20,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2115/VlZzWssgw9IYJNxeFk6f82rW.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2377-PPSA03286_00-CAMPCRETACEOUSPK,,50%,,"Simulation, Strategy",47.5,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2115/VlZzWssgw9IYJNxeFk6f82rW.png,,Jurassic World Evolution 2: Camp Cretaceous Dinosaur Pack,TRD,FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC,2022-03-08,jurassic-world-evolution-2-camp-cretaceous-dinosaur-pack-ps4&ps5-tr,,1,95,,47.5,1

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army. Get rid of the evil breed and fight against the swamp attack of the monsters!

Bonkies is a jolly party game about cooperation, space construction and the joys of colonizing the solar system as a team of monkeys. You and your prime mates will be tasked with raising all sorts of quirky constructions on distant planets, by stacking blocks so they fit a given outline.

Empowered with the gifts of technopathy, the ability to sense and affect electrical currents. You are the last hope to a band of outcastes and refugees. Lead them across the randomly generated wastelands. Pick fights with greedy slavers and crazy machines using the turn-based card combat. Can you survive long enough to reach the mysterious Crypt? Nowhere Prophet is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat. During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands. If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat. You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode. Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever. Nowhere Prophet is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman. In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.

The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don’t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required! Train yourself into a data science wizard! Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen. Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist! Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you’ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do! Coding just got real! Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right? Improve your gear, improve your life! Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you’ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it’s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe! Fun fact: this is what machine learning specialists actually do. Now, you can become one of them (minus the money)! while True: learn() is the best game about being a data science specialist because no one else has been weird enough to make another one!",2023-06-20,/game/56591,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1013/xMvGzPMjYWHQJUDM4xDkjvDn.png?w=200,7,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3250-CUSA19377_00-0000000000000001,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-SwMAiAbzo,30%,14,"Simulation, Educational, Puzzle",100.8,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202006/1013/xMvGzPMjYWHQJUDM4xDkjvDn.png,,while True: learn(),TRD,Nival International Limited,2020-07-07,while-true-learn-ps4-tr,,0,144,8,100.8,1

Featuring gorgeous hand-drawn illustrations, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine combines 2D visuals with a 3D overworld US map. Players wander across a folkloric Depression era United States at their own pace, meeting strangers with their own stories to tell. Through these interactions, players will be able to collect unique stories which can then be re-told to unlock new interactions. In this way the in-game stories themselves act as a currency to progress through the game, and it’s up to the player to pair the right story with the unique needs of each of the characters that you will encounter throughout your travels.

Up to 10 players can simultaneously fight in the Hexadiums, scenarios that are divided into 6 zones, each with its own gravity, different platforms, hideouts and open spaces, that turn them into a frenetic battlefield. In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle. This way, heroes will be an extension of each player’s style, creating an unique gameplay with hundreds of combinations. 1-4 players Network Players 2-10 - Full game requires PlayStation®Plus membership to access online multiplayer 4GB minimum save size DUALSHOCK®4 Vibration Function HD Video Output 720p,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.
