In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.<br /><br />DESIGNED FOR THE PS5<br />DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane's unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful.<br /><br />IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN <br />Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you'll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you'll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER <br />Are you the hero or the villain? You'll experience DEATHLOOP's main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom.

So if you're feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna's stylish sneakers and invade another player's campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.<br /><br />THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON    <br />Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay.

A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted?<br /><br />EPISODE THREE - \"CROSSROADS ELEGY\"<br /><br />In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters.

Over five alternating turns taking place in a 25\u201d time-loop, you are called to master the unique abilities of a varied cast of deep-space operatives and outskill, outsmart, and outmanoeuvre your opponent in mind-bending, four-dimensional battles.<br /><br />KEY FEATURES<br /><br />THINK DIFFERENTLY<br />Matches in Lemnis Gate take place within time loops. You have 25 seconds to execute your action, be it blasting an enemy, manoeuvring your operative, or setting up your next move. After all players have taken turns, the next 25-second round begins. Now you'll face what has happened while setting up what will happen. Each of the five rounds is your chance to alter the timeline as past, present, and future converge.<br /><br />A TIME-BENDING TACTICAL SHOOTER<br />With a varied cast of characters to choose from, how you play is up to you. Lay damaging toxic waste in your enemy's path, slow time to land the perfect shot, or deploy protective orbs to assist your future self. Every operative possesses a distinctive loadout and special ability that proves decisive on the battlefield.<br /><br />TEAM UP WITH YOURSELF<br />Welcome to the team comprised entirely of one: you. With Lemnis Gate's innovative auto co-op feature, you command every member of your side. Auto co-op gives you total control of five deep-space operatives, effectively enabling two competitors to duke it out in bustling ten-character matches. Become a literal one-person army.<br /><br />COUNTLESS POSSIBILITIES, ENDLESS OUTCOMES<br />From the first second to the last, anything can happen in Lemnis Gate. Each round is a fresh chance to implement an unbeatable new strategy \u2013 or earn redemption from an earlier error. Predict hostiles' routes, infiltrate enemy lines, and develop multi-layered gameplans by co-operating with yourself. Experiment both in and outside time, and get creative with causality.<br /><br />A HOST OF MODES AND MATCHTYPES<br />Create a match to your preference. Pick between a 1v1 and 2v2 contest, online or offline. Select your mode amongst three thrilling spins on established genre staples. There's Retrieve XM, in which you scramble to collect exotic matter and return it to your gate; Domination, which is about competing to capture zones; and Seek & Destroy, where you attempt to wreck your opponent's Resistors. Whether teaming up with a friend for \"hotseat\" local multiplayer, or pitting your operatives against online rivals, Lemnis Gate lets you set the board to suit your style.","ESRBRating":"Apresenta:","Publisher":"Frontier Developments PLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-08-03","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/2109/3mpvKaCSJ51XRErifM2jD1ou.png?w=200","Slug":"lemnis-gate-playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2514-PPSA02803_00-LEMNISGATE000000","platform":"Playstation","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67CpGkrChFw","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"PercentOff":"40%","Price":19.99,"genre":"Strategy,Multiplayer,First-Person","SalePrice":11.99,"PlusPrice":9.99,"MexPrice":"","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","OpenCriticURL":"","SaleEnds":"2022-02-17 07:59:00","Title":"Let's Sing 2021","LowestPrice":"8388607","SaleStarted":"2022-02-02 09:10:39","description":"Let the music take control and become the star of your party or sing your heart out solo!
