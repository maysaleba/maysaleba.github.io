"85","2024-09-04","Return to Monkey Island is an unexpected, thrilling return of series creator Ron Gilbert that continues the story of the legendary adventure games The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’. Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory. Return to Point & Click Swashbuckling Bringing classic point-and-click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze. Embark on Archipelago Adventures Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike. Created by a Legendary Crew The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights & Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).","2024-08-20","/game/109863","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/1822/9EgpieO87hFjIvMIxiUtLPnr.png?w=200","10","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3643-PPSA10123_00-RTMIPS5SIEE00000","50%","16","Adventure","999999","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/return-to-monkey-island","Return to Monkey Island","TRD","Devolver Digital","2022-11-08","return-to-monkey-island-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","879.00","11","439.50","0","",

"83","2024-09-04","MEET A NOT-SO-ORDINARY NUN INDIKA is a third-person, story-driven game set in a strange world where religious visions clash with harsh reality. It tells the story of a young nun who sets off on a journey of self-discovery with the most unusual, horn-headed companion by her side. On the outside, Indika seems to be a typical nun attempting to adjust to a difficult and monotonous monastery life. Humble and innocent in her appearance, do not be deceived as this young girl has also made a highly unlikely acquaintance—as she speaks with the devil himself. Indika’s unusual connection with the Evil One leads her on an errand beyond the safe walls of the monastery. The world she discovers can only be described as a wild combination of comedy and tragedy straight out of the novels by Dostoyevski and Bulhakov. ENJOY AN INDIE GAME WHERE EVERYTHING GOES The subjects of religion and authority are prevalent throughout Indika’s journey and she’ll be faced with many questions along the way. Guide her to find the answers one by one before she can finish her life-defining odyssey. Odd Meter is a small, independent studio formerly based in Moscow and now operating out of Kazakhstan. Its members put aesthetics at the forefront and aren’t afraid to tread the fine line of ethical norms. Their game is a great testament to that, as INDIKA constitutes an open challenge to the industry's established approach to creating video games.","2024-08-20","/game/139446","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/1114/2ab11b93f3b922d21a0c77af4baf962952e4e4d4ac775641.png?w=200","4","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-PPSA16214_00-0000000000INDIKA","20%","5","Adventure","656.25","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/indika","INDIKA","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2024-05-17","indika-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","4","700.00","0","",

His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder.

It is a story of simple emotions we all know so well and value more than sometimes we dare to admit: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Embark on the adventure of an extraordinary family of heroes. With the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil. But... it's not a story about saving the universe. It’s a story about a valiant family standing together while the world around them is being devoured by darkness.

As humanity entered this new era, deranged mutants known as Others began to descend from the sky with a hunger for human brains. Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity. Those with acute extra-sensory abilities, known as psionics, were our only chance to fight the onslaught from above.

Featuring a dual story, begin your adventure with either Yuito Sumeragi, an energetic recruit from a prestigious political family or Kasane Randall, the mysterious scout whose power and skill has gained great notoriety among the OSF.

"77","2024-09-04","Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment. DRIVE TO SURVIVE It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows. INVESTIGATE THE ZONE The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you. REPEAT Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.","2024-08-20","/game/113597","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0710/516003921755aa5cb8873cb08c22b172141e997a0d5cd075.png?w=200","20","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6847-PPSA17476_00-00000000000PS5EU","30%","46","Driving/Racing, Action","681.85","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/pacific-drive","Pacific Drive","TRD","Kepler Interactive Limited","2024-02-21","pacific-drive-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1049.00","30","734.30","0","",

When you cross paths with the Boy, a small creature whose mysterious powers have attracted the attention of Gemini, the Mistress of the Artifacts, you decide to protect him, unaware that much greater forces are involved. EXPLORE ZENOZOIK Drawing upon both surreal and punk fantasy influences, the world and civilisations of Zenozoik are brimming with fascinating characters, creatures and landscapes. Roam this intriguing land and discover its paths, inhabitants and ancient secrets. CRUSH YOUR OPPONENTS Your fists and speed are your greatest weapons. Attack, dodge, stun, block, counter a parry to land a special attack, switch to first-person view to perform unique techniques: each time, it's up to you to seize the occasion to achieve victory and avoid mistakes that could quickly prove fatal. CUSTOMISE YOUR COMBAT STYLE Learn various martial arts during your adventure and alternate freely between them based on the situation, types of enemies and your preference. Victories will enable you to improve your characteristics and upgrade your attacks, so you can develop your own unique style. RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE RITUAL Before fighting, you can challenge your opponent to a game of dice, with the winner defining the rules of the encounter – often to their advantage. Summoning a monster as an ally, covering the area in fog, having shackles limit movement… far from determining the outcome of the combat, the Ritual represents an opportunity to exploit if you win it or a challenge to cleverly overcome if you lose. A RICH STORYLINE Your search for the Great Artifacts that will help you defeat Gemini will take you farther than you ever imagined. While taking on the mercenaries pursuing you and developing your friendship with the Boy, you must confront your past and delve into the sources of the chaotic society of Zenozoik.

"73","2024-09-11","ENDLESS™ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESS™ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her ""unusual"" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESS™ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again.

As a six-year-old, “El Hijo” must always sneak past the dangers of his world. As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy.

However, the place doesn’t feel right and he plans his escape. “El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child.

"71","2024-09-11","The Escapists is an award winning prison break simulation that provides players the opportunity of experiencing a light-hearted insight into everyday prison life. Whilst the aim of the game is simply to escape, the detail is in the execution. (Don’t say the word execution too loud in a prison). You may not be in an open prison, but you are in an open world where in between attending rollcalls, mealtimes and doing your chores you should grab every chance to plan your escape. Do you do favours for other inmates earning money and boosting their opinion of you along the way? Or workout and become stronger? Read to increase your skills or spend your time crafting items into homemade weapons and tools. What about working diligently in your prison job, to gain promotions to new jobs with better benefits? Keep a low profile or go out all guns blazing, as long as you escape in the end, that’s all that matters In-game purchases optional 1 player 220MB minimum save size DUALSHOCK®4 Vibration Function Remote Play Supported HD Video Output 720p,1080i,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

Blending the viciously over-the-top gunplay of its predecessor with the elegant precision of the powerful katana, Shadow Warrior is an imaginative take on the classic arcade-style shooter. Shadow Warrior tells the offbeat tale of Zilla Enterprise’s corporate shogun Lo Wang as he is ordered to acquire a legendary blade of limitless power by his deceitful employer. Betrayed and left for dead, Lo Wang learns of the blade’s connection to ancient gods from another realm preparing to push our world to the brink of destruction. Now the reluctant hero must become legend through a masterful combination of gun, blade, magic and wit to uncover the truth behind the demonic invasion and banish evil back into the darkness. 1 player 8GB minimum save size DUALSHOCK®4 Vibration Function HD Video Output 720p,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

"69","2024-09-11","Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes. Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled—this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these—and more—to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience—a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0102-CUSA24163_00-MAKAIRE000000001","67%","0","Action","346.17","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection","Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection","TRD","CE EUROPE LIMITED","2021-05-31","ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","346.17","1","",

Not me, that’s for sure! …until that moron, Dan Teapot, hired a group of professional demon hunters to banish me! I don’t even know why he has a grudge against me. Maybe I burnt his house a couple of times, but I only did it because it was hilarious! Anyway. Help me in this adventure to best my foes and let’s make evil reign Darkestville once more! Also by purchasing this game you are helping a noble cause, part of your money will be used to enslave mankind… I mean… to clean the seas from pollution, create a sanctuary for the only Endangered Invisible Flamingo on this planet and other kind of noble sounding lies. Sincerely Evil, Cid P.S. So you’re trembling with fear already, aren’t you? That’s the spirit! Because this game is not only TERRIBLY interesting but also TERRIBLY funny! If you ever enjoyed Tim Schafer’s classic adventure games and are fond of the Time Burton’s black humor, we’re about to go along with you as these two Tims are my bros. Sure I wouldn’t be Cid if I didn’t add a couple of dozens of the cunning puzzles so don’t you wait a cakewalk. They say it takes seven hours to complete this game… Well let’s see if you can do it! I trust you can though – my incredible charm and fascinating sense of style are more than enough to overcome any challenge! P.P.S. While you were reading this, someone just rang the doorbell of my castle and left a box with an “INDIE PRIZE - Best Game Narrative” tag on it. Well… just another acknowledgment of my incomparable awesomeness!","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202007/2311/au7TDIMx5drfO7zmOX679XYN.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5190-CUSA16354_00-DSTCMB00000000EU","70%","0","Adventure, Puzzle, Unique","105","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/darkestville-castle","Darkestville Castle","TRD","ESDigital Games LTD","2020-08-13","darkestville-castle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","0","157.50","1","",

Seen as the answer to all the kingdom’s ailments, alchemy became a widely used practice across the land, with denizens welcoming it into their homes, using it to enhance and heal as they saw fit.

Within days, the kingdom fell to chaos, infected monsters prowling the blood-soaked streets, all hope of a cure lost. Corvus is the kingdom’s final hope, the fate of Hermes resting in his feathered hands.

Brace your loins with up to four players to run ‘n’ gun as dozens of different bros and eliminate the opposing terrorist forces that threaten our way of life. Unleash scores of unique weapons and set off incredible chain reactions of fire, napalm, and limbs in the name of freedom. Features: The Broforce: Deliver your own brand of shock and awe with dozens of bros each with their own unique weaponry and special attacks designed to dispatch freedom across the world. Bro-Op & Deathmatch: Battle terrorism with up to four players in cooperative mode or sever ties with your bros and face each other in several bombastic competitive modes. Fully Destructible Everything: Destructible terrain opens up a slew of strategic options while the abundance of Exploding Red Barrels of Justiceâ„¢ can literally level the playing field with one shot. *** Broforce Forever Update *** Broforce Forever, the long-awaited free update to 2015’s most patriotic video game, held back from freedom-loving gamers for a crime it didn’t commit, has promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade and unleashes a megaton of Kentucky-fried carnage into the face of evil. The final update offers an improved and expanded campaign with new unlocks, along with six new ultra patriotic bros, four new democracy-spreading challenge levels, and the ultimate expression of military might – bug fixes! The best way for a returning player to enjoy this is to play through the entire campaign again. And again. Forever. NEW BROS Harness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Seth Brondle, wield Xebro’s flying Chakram, serenade (and grenade) terrorism with the flamenco firebrand Desperabro, or become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer! If sniping is more your style, famed bug hunter Bro Gummer brings pinpoint liberation with his trusty rifle, while Demolition Bro’s Freeze Grenades put evildoers right back where they belong… ON ICE. NEW BADDIES A Bro only becomes a force when confronted with those who seek to destroy their freedoms, and in Broforce Forever, the terrorists are even more determined to delete democracy. Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice. NEW CHALLENGES Bros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards. Succeed and unlock one of four new flexes that can be deployed by any Bro, any time, any place. Just like freedom. ***","2024-08-20","/game/17638","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1206/ZBrZdWMpe8J5dHsXfJxWsGHr.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3643-CUSA03887_00-00000BROFORCEPS4","80%","17","Action, Action, Action","105","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/broforce","Broforce","TRD","Devolver Digital","2016-02-29","broforce-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","525.00","9","105.00","1","",

Excavate the bedrock, reap the rewards of Mother Earth, and trade the mined valuables for new gadgets, travels, funky wild fashion, and more. Cave Digger 2: Dig Harder is a 1-4-player VR action-adventure game set in wildland valleys, where you discover old mines, nautical caves, and ruins of ancient civilizations inspired by Western, Dieselpunk and Lovecraftian themes. Explore the ""pristine"" lands, loot its riches, and unravel the mystery linked to a great explorer. As you go, it's best to keep a six-shooter nearby just in case. Tools and Progression Get thrown right away into the deep end by being stuck in the mines as your drill machine broke. With a single pickaxe, work your way to the surface camp where your journey can begin in earnest. Your goal is simply to mine and carry loot back to the surface the best you can for your mission assigners. With the surplus reward that you get, you can buy new things like upgrading your dependable pickaxe with a shinier look! (And faster digging rate.) Or buy dynamites that work on pretty much anything that needs to be worked on. Maybe you fancy a shovel that works for both digging and moving through the caves like a spider-miner. Whatever your preferred loadout, you will be ready to go deeper into the ever-shifting caves than any miner before or after you! Story The valleys have their mysteries and they hide them well. Step by step the player follows the same path where a great explorer has once wandered. Who is this hardy explorer? Why did he come to these valleys? And where is he now? The answers to these and more lie in the depths of the valleys. The story has multiple endings, each revealing a different side of it. Find the scattered comic pages to a tale of greed, eldritch power, and secrets beyond space and time. Who the wanderer is and why he did what he did in the valleys become clear in the end. But is it really the end? Co-op Multiplayer Gather a party of up to 4 players. Your role in the mining team is totally up to you! As long as at least somebody is carrying their weight in gold back to the surface, you all get paid in official Merchant Dollars equally. Co-op crossplay supports public matchmaking and private groups, and you are very free to show your wildlands drip by combining from a generous selection of clothes, hats and faces once you've bought them first! So, take a pickaxe (and your friends) with you and head to the wildlands for the riches it holds, find out the secrets it contains, and dig deeper into the valleys than any adventurer before or after you!

Play as Gaia, the Spirit of Life, and navigate stunning platforming environments in an abstract world to salvage the souls of extinct animals. Revive these creatures after learning their final fate: the last whale harpooned, the final eagle caged, the last deer hunted down, and more, while you survive encounters with dangerous, oil-covered Devourers that roam the wasteland in search of remaining life. In this emotional journey from the creators of the critically acclaimed Arise: A Simple Story, you alone can restore life to the planet.

From dying forests to the heart of crumbling cities, through the dry seabed and polluted skies, each environment will offer new challenges for Gaia to face and will present her different versions of the Devourers’ wake of destruction as she spreads life and beauty on her path. • A story of contrasts: After Us offers a somber look at a world decimated by human impact. As you guide Gaia’s light through it and discover the causes behind the destruction, you will learn the fate of the Devourers as agents of extinction, but also agents of progress, love, and hope.","2024-08-27","/game/118233","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202304/0312/293739904a7a7ce07856d5e3324f6e3dcd1e3602fb442425.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4829-PPSA07949_00-AFUS00000000SIEE","50%","11","Adventure","0","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/after-us","After Us","TRD","TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE UK","2023-05-23","after-us-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1925.00","11","962.50","0","",

"63","2024-09-11","Alone in the Dark weaves a chilling tapestry of psychological horror and Southern Gothic charm, reimagining the iconic game that set the benchmark for the genre. We invite you to join us on a journey into madness, where each encounter could be your last. With each step you take closer to unravelling Derceto's mystery, the eyes that watch from the darkness grow hungrier. Every bullet means the difference between survival and an unthinkable end. The next door you unlock could lead to a nightmarish realm offering nothing but slashing claws, grasping tentacles, and frayed sanity. Journey to interbellum Louisiana, where an era of decadence hides a darker tale - of escape from past traumas and an intolerant society, into the waiting grasp of something darker, something that has patiently lurked for impossible eons. This is Alone in the Dark as you've never seen it - a skillfully-woven narrative of Southern Gothic elegance and eldritch madness that pays homage to its legendary origins while taking the next step forward in survival horror storytelling. A Haunting Tale of Mystery and Madness Step inside Derceto Manor, an asylum shrouded in intrigue, guarding a terrible secret. Client Emily Hartwood and private investigator Edward Carnby embark on a harrowing quest for answers; Emily to the mystery of her missing uncle, Edward to the toughest case he will ever face, and both to questions they dare not ask themselves. This re-envisioned classic invites you to explore an unforgettable single player adventure rich with suspense, frights, and revelations that will test the limits of your imagination. Featuring Hollywood Talent Experience some of the greatest acting survival horror has ever seen through the performances of award-winning actors Jodie Comer (Killing Eve, Free Guy) and David Harbour (Stranger Things, Black Widow) in their first videogame roles. Jodie and David’s immaculately captured likenesses breathe life into Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby, lending a deeply personal aspect to Alone in the Dark’s story that demands it be played twice to get the full experience. A Tribute to Horror Pioneers Rediscover the essence of psychological horror in a game that respectfully nods to its 1992 origin, the game that established the survival horror genre. Alone in the Dark is your gateway to an experience steeped in the atmospheric dread of classic horror, with next-generation storytelling and gameplay. A must-play for fans of twisted tales, nerve-wracking exploration, and desperate combat. A Story That Challenges Reality Envisioned by Mikael Hedberg, acclaimed writer behind modern horror classics “SOMA” and “Amnesia”, Alone in the Dark’s intricate web of mystery delves into themes of trauma, faith, evil, and abandonment. Whether you choose to brave the nightmare as Emily or Edward, you will uncover secrets that defy everything you thought about videogame storytelling.","2024-08-27","/game/112498","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/1015/b3a91fa43661ced3d57a908c26f5bfab057584343be6f618.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4389-PPSA08135_00-ALONEINTHEDARKEU","30%","18","Horror, Adventure, Puzzle","1469.3","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/alone-in-the-dark","Alone in the Dark","TRD","THQ NORDIC GMBH","2024-03-20","alone-in-the-dark-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","10","1469.30","0","",

IMPORTANT HEALTH WARNING ABOUT PLAYING VIDEO GAMES Photosensitive seizures A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these “photosensitive epileptic seizures” while watching video games. These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eyes or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects. Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms – children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures. The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions: sit farther from the screen, use a smaller screen, play in a well-lit room, do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued. If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1202/z5tGmstkqZ5YZ8U4DvKNcpbZ.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0700-CUSA11932_00-LOA0000000000001","75%","0","Unique","262.25","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/twin-mirror","Twin Mirror","TRD","DON'T NOD ENTERTAINMENT SARL","2020-11-30","twin-mirror-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","262.25","1","",

"51","2024-09-11","The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™ follows the Dwarves as they embark on a new adventure to reclaim their legendary home of Moria beneath the Misty Mountains. Players will join forces to survive, craft, build and explore the iconic, sprawling mines. Courageous expeditioners will need to be vigilant as mysterious dangers await. Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria—known as Khazad-dûm or Dwarrowdelf—in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures. Set in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there’s clatter, there’s combat. Excavate the mysteries of three legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within. Key Game Features: ● Feel the Fellowship: Experience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. ● Survive the Dark: To survive the treacherous Mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain. ● Base Building: Find solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to destroy Dwarven progress. ● Rebuild and Reshape Moria: Restore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-dûm to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses. Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources. ● Explore: Delve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger, providing a unique experience each and every time. ● Co-op Multiplayer: Adventure alone or band together with friends in online cooperative multiplayer. ● Craft Dwarven Tools, Weapons and More: Craft and loot legendary Dwarven armor, tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines. ● Uncover Magic Artifacts: Discover ancient magic items including swords that glow when Orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom. ● Mine Ore and Jewels: Establish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril. Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear. But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness. ● Comprehensive Dwarf Builder: Players become part of Dwarven Legend as they create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator. Dwarves can be customized in a variety of ways to create a unique Dwarven identity. Then, during gameplay, players can find and craft armor and weapons to further enhance their unique style.","2024-08-27","/game/109177","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0520/d7bb0cab42052c1946d6fdcf236f059ee850819f9008843c.png?w=200","35","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7581-PPSA16618_00-0277621140622233","20%","83","Adventure","656.25","null","https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria","The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™","TRD","North Beach Games","2023-12-04","the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","48","700.00","0","",

Your kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner. Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive. The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen. And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter. A realistic tree growth algorithm simulates the forests.

"0","2024-09-04","Jesus did not die on the cross, but came down and unleashed vengeance on all the nonbelievers. 1500 years later, an army of Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith. In this dark fantasy adventure you solve intricate cases and unveil abysmal secrets as Inquisitor Mordimer Madderdin. The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation. Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy’s weak points against them.","2024-08-20","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0813/6c0abbadb6ee8ae04ec8ba8c2b225bedacea0bd6a8733cd9.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA10961_00-0THEINQUISITORDX","25%","0","Adventure","674.25","null","null","The Inquisitor - Deluxe Edition","TRD","Kalypso Media GMBH","2024-02-08","the-inquisitor-deluxe-edition-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","899.00","0","674.25","0","",

"","2024-09-04","“You must play this. It’s luminous.” 5/5 – Eurogamer “It’s all so brilliant and unapologetically different from anything else.” 9/10 – Press Start “A beautifully written tale about loss, friendship and the ties that bind us together, set in a sumptuous oceanic post-apocalypse.” Rock Paper Shotgun Saltsea Chronicles is a new story-driven adventure game from the award-winning indie studio Die Gute Fabrik (Mutazione, Sportsfriends). Captain Maja’s misfit crew must heist their impounded ship and mount a rescue. Guide the crew across islands of a post-flood world known as ‘Saltsea’. Explore strange and wonderful communities, uncover a deep conspiracy, choose where to go and which crew members to investigate with, and chart a journey through twists and turns, difficulties and delights. A Post-Flood World Visit different island communities as you investigate the mystery at the heart of the game. This flooded world, betrayed by the so-called 'Hoarders', barely remembers a time before the Flood. They rebuilt on the ruins of what came before, and new talents and technologies took the place of the old. Many surprises await! Choose Your Priorities In Saltsea Chronicles you guide the entire crew through the story. As well as investigating the mystery of your captain’s disappearance, you will uncover secrets, create and resolve tensions between the crew, and add to your number as you meet others who ask to join you. Each chapter, you pick which island to visit and who to send on the expedition. Your choices will unlock different content, develop relationships, and give you a chance to resolve (and create) tensions within the crew. With a lightning-fast navigation system, you’re free to hop around the islands as you explore. Choose between short and snappy observations, or dig deep into conversations, exploring the islands across different times of day. Uncover a Conspiracy Was your captain kidnapped? Or did she leave of her own free will? Keep track of the mystery in Murl’s Log and collect records of your encounters as stickers in the Almanac. Different playthroughs will trace different pathways, with some dramatic consequences for your crew. You can replay from any chapter and branch your save file to meet new crew members, explore different communities and uncover a rich and gripping story. Themes From an award-winning and diverse writersroom – with experience in Young Adult fiction, film, theatre, poetry and games – Saltsea Chronicles imagines a rich world where communities have rebuilt in the aftermath of disaster, creating a new society of connection, resilience and hope—but one still troubled by the universal questions of how to live together through conflict and change. This wide-reaching story game traces meaningful themes with humour, lightness of touch, and care. Features: * Distinctive print-inspired art style: A unique art style inspired by risograph print techniques brings a storybook aesthetic to the fantasy-tinged world of Saltsea Chronicles. * Try your hand at Spoils: Spoils is a trick-taking card game from the world of Saltsea Chronicles. Play cards with each local community, but watch out – some islands have their own house rules! * An original soundtrack by Eli Rainsberry: IGF-nominated composer and sound artist Eli Rainsberry (No Longer Home, A Monster's Expedition) presents a musically hybrid score and soundscape guided by the spaces and characters of Saltsea Chronicles. * Navigate the drama as well as the seas: Tensions between crew members are represented by Issues, small ‘relationships quests’ you can track, resolve, or, sometimes, just have to leave unsolved.","2024-08-20","/game/129812","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2918/55c77f490a5d4e3e211e8704528183cb2c63d41579913fcb.png?w=200","8","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3301-PPSA16162_00-0340776881686966","20%","32","Adventure","656.25","null","null","Saltsea Chronicles","TRD","DIE GUTE FABRIK ApS","2023-10-12","saltsea-chronicles-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","12","700.00","0","",

Play as Ali, a curious and sarcastic high schooler who ditches band camp to go on a cross-country road trip. But this isn’t a joyride! Ali is on an all-important mission to save her family video store from the nasty loan sharks trying to shut their shop down. Swindle strangers, pickpocket people, and con commoners across a wacky America of the ‘90s. And – it should go without saying – lie to your mom about all of it. Choose who deserves to be conned and who might need a helping hand. The world is your oyster (and hey, pearls are worth a lot!). One Con Doesn’t Fool All Con people your way! Wear disguises, sneak around, eavesdrop on conversations, and learn how to approach each mark. Maybe you think you can make enough cheddar just by pickpocketing. Or seek out more complex grifts that involve breaking and entering, smooth talking, and more. It’s up to you to outsmart everyone and lockpick everything that stands between you and saving your mom's video store. A Coming-of-Age Comedy If there’s one surefire way to discover yourself, it’s by setting out on an adventure. Luckily for you, you’ve got the aid of an expert grifter to coach you in the elusive art of charm. But a life of crime is no laughing matter! Not unless you turn on the laugh track and make it a criminally funny sitcom. Get ready to talk your way into deals, hearts, and trouble. And don’t forget to call home every once in a while to check in with your mom. Sure, you might argue with her sometimes (most of the time?), but you’re a teenager - that’s kind of your job! The Weird and Wack 1990s the Way You Remember Them Whether you were a ‘90s kid or not, this game is brimming with nostalgia. It offers you the perfect opportunity to relive your own awkward high school years, or if you sadly missed out on the ‘90s, finally experience all of the classic teen movies that feel so old and outdated.

"","2024-09-04","One summer's day, Usada and Kotora go to the library to do their homework. While Kotora takes her studies seriously, Usada has her head in the clouds. She wanders over to a bookshed deep inside, returning with a big, thick book. ""I found this interesting-looking book!"" Kotora looks back at her quizzically. Suddenly, a slip of paper falls out from the book. The letter reads: ""Find Alice."" As soon as they read the words, the two are enveloped in a blinding light. When they come to, they're in a grassy field that they've never seen before. At that moment, a white rabbit comes hopping along. He might know how to get back to their own world! The pair take their first steps into the world of this magical book, in order to go searching for the white rabbit... Alice Escaped! is an exploratory 2D action Metroidvania. Follow the adventures of Usada and Kotora, who have wandered into a strange wonderland of grimoires and must chase after a mysterious girl named Alice in order to return to their own world. What awaits them in this mysterious world are strange yet familiar characters, such as Cheshire Cat, Mad Hatter, and Humpty Dumpty. Are they friends or foes? And why does the white rabbit Usamura have a zipper on his back? And who exactly is this enigmatic girl hiding Alice in the deepest part of the world? This is where you've probably realized that this game has multiple endings. There are numerous major choices to be made, a story that repeats itself, and the true goals of the characters to be revealed. An adventure the likes of which you've never experienced before is about to begin! â–  Battle Action One of the core points of this game is its stylish, tag-team battle system! Swing Usada’s giant hammer to pulverize your enemies with powerful melee attacks, or use Kotora’s submachine gun and bombs to take out enemies from a distance. Switch between the two to chain impressive combos! Chaining combos will increase their attack power, and make it easier to quickly defeat your many oncoming enemies. Taking out enemies builds up your Chance Gauge, which can be used to perform supporting attacks and devastating ultimate attacks. (Feature not included in the demo.) The intensity builds in boss fights: whittle down their Shield Gauge to break their shields, letting you unleash a flurry of attacks. But beware: they've got a variety of powerful attacks to hit you back with! â–  Our heroines learn and grow When you collect the skill crystals that drop all over the world, you can improve your characters' skills. You can improve their weapons, which will then unlock unique skills. Or you can focus on their stats and movement, and even pick up skills to help them convince others to help them. If you find yourself stuck on a difficult boss, then try taking some time away from the main path to help our heroes grow stronger. Scattered about here and there in the world are death matches (areas where you can't proceed without defeating all of the enemies there), and if you can finish them with a high-count combo, or without taking any damage, you can earn skill crystal fragments. In addition, out in the world you can also find Heart Crystals, which increase your heroes' maximum health, in addition to other key items that they'll need on their adventure. Based on what you find, you might find that they're protected by powerful traps, just like the treasure you'd find deep inside of a cave. Go explore any way you wish in the world of Alice in Wonderland!","2024-08-20","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/1820/f41253f41480d5c0a2e1dafd651b1915afe01ac0126acd96.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0734-CUSA43414_00-0922380785609695","20%","0","Action","489.3","null","null","Alice Escaped!","TRD","SEKAI PROJECT, INC","2023-08-24","alice-escaped!-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","559.20","1","",

Villagers cry out for a hero, help them to rise up against the forces of this feared villain. Construct buildings to strengthen your village, train your army and equip your allies. Look for key-assistance in other villages, such as dwarves, amazons, and witches. With their help and the strengthening of your army, lead missions, defeat the invaders and make the region a safe place again. We are stronger together! Unlike regular Tower Defense games, Warstone TD has a unique method of summoning defenders (towers represented by player’s allies and army). You start a mission with a fairly empty map and a few stones where you can place defenders. As the level progresses, more stones appear and some even drop from enemies, allowing you to place them in any valid position on the map. Powerful warstones also occasionally appear, which give significant bonuses to specific defenders when placed on them. You can summon any of the basic army classes on the stones. Each class has its own specialization path, damage type, gold cost, and special abilities. With such a variety of defenders and game classes there is a huge amount of tactics , increasing replayability even further! This is Warstone TD Gold Edition, a rare jewel of the game that will take you through the complete experience, including the Astral Voyage expansion with new battles and challenging enemies in even harder modes.

A megacorporation named MK is using its power to control the population, and her community is in danger. She soon discovers that she has a gift of clairvoyance that connects her to Reverie, the realm of the Aspirations of Humanity: Glory, Bliss, Power, Chaos, Bond, and Truth. In this world, Polly becomes Harmony, an Oracle who has the power to choose the Aspiration that will ultimately rule over Reverie and restore the delicate balance between the deities’ world and ours.

"","2024-09-04","THE APOCALYPSE HAPPENED... In a desperate move to end all wars that have been rampaging the world for decades, the mages provoked The Cataclysm. Massive balls of pure magic obliterated nearly everything. A strange purple mist propagated everywhere, with hordes of bloodthirsty mutants coming at night. Our only hope is now to banish all magic from this accursed world by casting The Last Spell, requiring several days of uninterrupted incantation whilst a few strained Heroes try to protect those damned mages. The Last Spell is a tactical RPG with roguelite elements in which you have to defend a city against hordes of deadly enemies. During daytime, prepare your Heroes, carefully choose how to rebuild your Haven and position your defenses. Over the night, exterminate all the monsters coming at your walls with a large range of weapons and skills. Then heal, level up, and repeat until the Magic Seal is broken. FEATURES Turn-Based Tactical RPG: â—� The whole RPG package: a flurry of stats, skills, perks, traits… and more. â—� Tons of items: armors, weapons, trinkets and potions… with their own stats and skills, as well as optional random modifiers. Each weapon has its own skillset and playstyle! â—� Build your own classes: upgrade your heroes with stat bonuses and perks, and equip whatever gear you wish. Want to make a glass cannon rogue/mage fighting with a gun? Do it! â—� Manage your squad of heroes: they’re strong, but they are few and have access to limited resources. Healing and mana are scarce, so try to find a good balance. Hordes of Evil: â—� Think and adapt: you will face swarms of deadly enemies with only a few hardened heroes. Optimize your positioning and plan your actions: big AOE attacks, crowd control, buffs, poison... Every Action Point counts towards another day of survival. â—� Enemies have strengths and weaknesses that will challenge your wits. And because hard is not enough for us, be prepared for the terrifying Elites! â—� Each map will end with epic fights against unique mind-bending bosses. Protect the Haven: â—� Rebuild the city to help you in-between fights. Get healed, forge new magical weapons, get new heroes. Spend your resources wisely, commander! â—� Build up your defenses: walls, traps, towers, catapults… every tiny bit of help is welcome. â—� Protect the Magic Circle at all costs! If you lose it, humanity is doomed. â—� 5 Havens to protect, each with their own setup and challenges requiring you to tailor your strategy to beat the Great Evil. Roguelite Elements: â—� The game is meant to be hard. You will fail… A lot. But every time you do, you’ll grow harder, better, faster, stronger! â—� Procedurally generated enemy waves, characters, weapons and a ton of unlockables will keep you entertained until the real world collapses. â—� Tailor each run thanks to the Omens: a limited amount of bonuses that can be picked for the upcoming run. Do you prefer more Action Points, more characters, sturdier defenses, better loot? Experiment to find your preferred tools of destruction. â—� Scale the difficulty to your liking, with 6 levels of Apocalypse to entertain even the most crazy hardcore players.","2024-08-20","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202303/0613/103bc799353f562b710a34015ca09d895ed2f64556c8b194.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5539-PPSA09525_00-2899485575378333","40%","0","Role-Playing","437.5","null","null","The Last Spell","TRD","The Arcade Crew","2023-03-09","the-last-spell-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","875.00","0","525.00","1","",
"","2024-09-04","[About This Game] â– One-of-a-kind, unique action! The protagonist, Kuuta, attacks the enemy using his club. Kazemaru sucks the enemy's spirit out of its body, and by destroying that spirit, Kuuta can then claim victory. Enjoy an all-new, unique co-op experience by playing both Kuuta and Kazemaru at the same time! â– A different way to level up! Kisejima, where the game takes place, is divided into three areas with a variety of challenges ranging from fighting enemies to escort missions. The player can also level up by running away from pursuing monsters, like a game of tag, and collecting mushrooms that grow in clusters to purchase upgraded clubs. [What is ONI : Road to be the Mightiest Oni?] â– Setting: Kisejima Island The story takes place on Kisejima, a small island in the middle of the ocean. Here, it is said that the power that lies dormant within the local demon spirits can be drawn out by challenging them to trials, where ancient demons who were once defeated by Momotaro are summoned to battle. However, few have ever returned from Kisejima alive. â– Characters: Kuuta, a demon warrior, and his spirit partner, Kazemaru Kuuta, the protagonist, is the only survivor of the Demon King's army that faced Momotaro in battle. He and Kazemaru, a mysterious spirit that lives on Kisejima, team up to take on challenges of all shapes and sizes! â– Artwork by KENEI DESIGN Kisejima may not be large, but the colorful artwork by KENEI DESIGN, with its dazzling green meadows, looming forests, and plains of floating megaliths, offers a unique emotional impact unlike any other action game. Its solo creator has invented a mini-world in which each and every location is marked by its own memorable appeal.

"","2024-09-04","Welcome to Praslav, a cold Central European city that grows even colder with the coming winter. Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades. While most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go. You are one of those people. In-depths Survival Mechanics: Keep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point. Combat and Crime System: How far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are. Winter is Coming: Spend the last few days of autumn wisely – gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again. Expansive Story: Unlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav. Homeless, But Not Hopeless: Maybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own. You Are Not Alone: Is surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter. Claim the Throne: For over a decade, no one has been able to bring the many factions of the homeless together. The throne of the Homeless King has been sitting empty for far too long. Who will earn enough respect and prove themselves worthy of uniting the homeless? Will you rise to the occasion?","2024-08-20","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1814/dqyOj6BeMDetJ9RSM8OQOzhw.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6075-CUSA29679_00-1040084594243406","45%","0","Role-Playing","437.5","null","null","Hobo: Tough Life","TRD","Perun Creative s.r.o.","2023-02-22","hobo-tough-life-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","875.00","0","481.25","1","",

The Mansion also hosts a mysterious cast of characters who may help or hinder your progress on each run... Features • Creepy and Thrilling storyline unfolds (pun intended) as you progress in the game and unlocks different endings depending on your performance • Game mechanics designed for high replayability • Perma-death • The more you fail and start over, the more you learn about the mechanics • Unique AI for each enemy type - unexpected behaviours - makes enemies creepier and more fearsome • Logical puzzles are designed to make the player think • Collectible Upgrades • Customize your equipment before each run to shape your own play style Run by run, Paper Cut Mansion will offer you the opportunity of defining your playstyle as you unlock new abilities and discover new equipment that will give you a better chance of overcoming the challenges each procedurally generated run throws at you. Each new item offers further customisation to your ultimate build, allowing for truly unique set ups. Do you want to get in close as a melee fighter or take shots from afar as a ranged marksman? Set yourself up with a drone who can do the fighting for you or create an engineering build who can lay down traps and turrets as you back enemies into them. Completing quests will also grant you temporary perks, making each run feel fresh as you may not get the same perks to choose from next time! The possibilities are endless and there is no correct way to overcome the ever-shifting procedural rooms of the mansion. The mansion itself also has a dimension-hopping twist. Each floor contains portals that lead you to alternate versions of the same location. Each dimension switches up the aesthetics and gameplay. You always start in the NeoCortex dimension, which plays out like an escape room, filled with challenges, puzzles and surprises. From there, you will receive quests that take you into the Reptilian Complex and the Limbic System Dimensions. In the Reptilian Complex, the mansion takes on a fiery appearance as it is overrun with monsters. The Limbic system sees an icy chill overtake the mansion. You’ll need to move quickly and stay near heat sources as the cold damages you on your search for hidden items or torches to light up. With a variety of enemies, clues, quests, secrets, loot and compelling logic puzzles scattered throughout the mansion, there is always something intriguing to discover on each run.

"","2024-09-04","Escape String is a 2D puzzle game set in an undefined time and place. A small humanoid robot wakes up in the debris of a landfill inside a large factory. He receives strange and enigmatic messages, from someone who apparently wants to help him. The robot's purpose is to explore the large factory where he is in search of answers about who he and his mysterious remote helper are. The player does not control the robot directly and in real time, but inserts movement commands above its display in order to tell the robot when it is time to jump, to crouch and more. It is therefore a puzzle game based on perspective: the player must calculate the spaces between the robot and the obstacles. The obstacles are initially totally static, but as they advance they will be more and more dynamic and varied. For example, we will have guard robots that will perform the same actions as our robot in a mirrored manner. There are currently 40 levels, with 8 types of obstacles. The real challenge will consist in finishing the level with the minimum possible number of indications (input) and providing these commands in a single line (string), ending the level while simultaneously satisfying these conditions will unlock the """"gold chip"""" of that particular level. The """"gold chip"""" will be used to unlock new skins for our robot. This title is therefore suitable both for those looking for a relaxing puzzle, given the non-dynamic gameplay, and for those looking for a challenge given its arcade nature. - Original puzzle game - Suitable for all ages - Many types of obstacles - Relaxing but with a good level of challenge - 40 levels, expandable - Original art sector - Skins for the character - No microtransactions","2024-08-20","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0918/J74I6xtnTXOobXQ5SGU1zxnZ.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8151-CUSA37535_00-5946527224077423","50%","0","Puzzle","122.5","null","null","Escape String","TRD","7 RAVEN STUDIOS CO.

"","2024-09-04","Idol Manager is a business simulator where you conquer the entertainment industry by using any means necessary. You take on the role of manager at a small (but growing!) talent agency. As you cultivate and train the newest generation of young pop stars, you'll have to decide who to hire and who to fire, who gets promoted and who gets reprimanded. The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always sunshines and rainbows. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their emotional meltdowns and PR nightmares can spell financial disaster for your company. It's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of gossip magazines, super fans, and rival groups, all thirsty for a scoop on the latest scandal. There's a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's nothing personal, it's just business. â– Idol Training Provide voice training and dance lessons to the idols you have scouted, and train them to become top-notch idols. Do you want a cool group or a cute group? Will the office control what they post on social networking sites? Or how long should their skirts be? You decide. â– CD Production Lyrics, musical arrangement, choreography, number of singers per group, who will be front and center? The players themselves will have to make the tough decisions, produce the music and CD, and then release it. Of course, watch how much funds you have before you end up in the red! â– Advertising Activities Your Idol’s work isn't just to sing and dance in concerts. They may appear in magazines, TV, or livestreams on the Internet. Take on a wide variety of media outlets to increase your fan base! â– Office Management In addition to releasing single CDs, you can freely operate a cafe, theater, general elections, program production, and many other types of businesses. However, there is a limit to your funds. Be careful to not become a shoestring operation and watch your revenue! â– Complicated human relations Idol management is fraught with problems, such as scandals, media manipulation, and interpersonal relation issues between idol group members and outsiders. To avoid risks, form good relationships and aim for smooth office management. â– Fascinating Story The story is set in the Japanese entertainment industry, and there are many events outside the main storyline. You can even marry your idol! How this story ends, is entirely up to you. â– Free Play Style Free play with no storyline can also be used to avoid random events and love scandals. There are two unique difficulty levels: ""Relaxed,"" where you cannot go bankrupt, and ""Unfair,"" which makes it more difficult for players to make ends meet.

"","2024-09-04","CAVYHOUSE, creators of Forget Me Not: My Organic Garden and The Midnight Sanctuary, presents their latest “Clicker-style Dungeon Agriculturalization Rogue-like Game”! Level-up not only your character, but your dungeon itself to score huge bumper crops of items and Magic Circles galore! By continuously exploring deeper and deeper into the dungeon, you can remake (agriculturalize) your dungeon, increasing your strategic efficiency and gradually transforming it into a bountiful and profitable farm in this extremely unique and original Rogue-like game combining elements of dungeon exploration and clicker-style gameplay. â–¼ Story There once was a novice alchemist named Irene. Having recently lost her beloved mother, she decided to start her own business as a way to help take her mind off of her grief and become more independent. One day, she found a cheap secondhand dungeon for sale in an online alchemist shop called ""Mercuri"", and bought it immediately. However, if a deal seems too good to be true, well... The dungeon turned out to be full of strange enemies, which Irene must defeat before gathering items for her alchemy practices. Upon finally reaching the deeper depths of the dungeon, exhausted, she encounters a doll-like set of twins and the mysterious dead body of an unknown man. This is where Irene's dodgy dungeon murder mystery begins... â–¼ Game System The basic game system is pretty simple: Explore the dungeon > Harvest items > Go back home and handle various “preparations” > Explore the dungeon some more. During the preparation phase, you can develop and expand your dungeon or acquire new skills for Irene. Learning new skills will allow you to dive deeper into the dungeon and fight against tougher enemies and bosses. â–¼ Dungeon Agriculturalization There are two distinct “levels” for each dungeon floor: Farm level and Magic level. Increasing Farm level will increase the number of items made available; Increasing Magic level will increase the number of useful magic circles. Ultimately, if you manage to maximize both levels for a particular floor, you can then agriculturalize it. Once agriculturalized, the floor becomes a veritable paradise, providing large amounts of items and free of any enemies. â–¼ Various Skills There are over 100 types of skills, such as Attack, Heal, Enchant, Item Management, etc. Each player can develop their own unique play style based on how they manage and combine their various skills. Prepare yourself well, go out and explore the dungeon, and level up both your character and your dungeon... It’s an all-new type of Rogue-like exploration and adventure!","2024-08-20","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202112/1509/tew1iMYstcPik6SFqREgDbnC.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0122-CUSA29164_00-THESEALEDAMPOULE","40%","0","Adventure","357","null","null","The Sealed Ampoule","TRD","PLAYISM","2022-02-02","the-sealed-ampoule-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","595.00","0","357.00","1","",

This leads you straight into the middle of an exciting murder case and a murder mystery unfolds while you listen to the testimonies of witness, friends and relatives. The whole game is somewhat Christmas flavored - however, don't get yourself comfortable, the game not going to give you a nice and warm feeling but rather confront you with a cold and harsh reality as the thrilling storytelling of the game will leave you with a cold shiver down your spine. The game is a must have for any true fan of thrillers and anyone how enjoys a murder mystery that goes beyond the normal story telling. How does the gameplay work? You will play as a free-floating ghost like creature. Basically, as the soul of someone who is experiencing the story. You are very small in comparison to the surroundings and can fly freely through the area. You start by exploring the area and enjoying the feeling of flying as well as the gentle yet mysterious background music. Soon after starting to explore, you will find the first memory piece. You can collect the memory pieces to continue with the story and to advance with the overall narration. The story talks about a young boy, about his live and about how everything changes. It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. The first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become. Once you have finished a chapter by collecting all memory pieces and finishing the overall story of a level you will continue into the next chapter.","2024-08-20","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/0713/MdykcFBrVbTsRxO86dAiH7Uh.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6556-CUSA31171_00-6244328745700174","40%","0","Horror, Unique, Simulation","297.5","null","null","Murder Diaries 3 - Santa's Trail of Blood","TRD","EpiXR Games UG","2021-12-16","murder-diaries-3-santas-trail-of-blood-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","595.00","0","357.00","1","",

Now, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass.

"","2024-09-04","The world of Lera has fallen ill to an unstoppable plague and as the King of Ebris, you – Farren – franticly seek a way to bring an end to your people’s suffering in Ena: The Kingdom Above All Kingdoms. And to rid your world of this illness once and for all. In the weakness of your distress, your Regent – Gulbrand – speaks to you a tale of hope, a way to purify the world by means of the Spires and the extraordinary resources that await beyond the realms. Desperate for answers, you leave Gulbrand in charge of your kingdom to trek out to the other six Kingdoms of Lera and reopen the Spires; the other kings willing or not. You succeed in your endeavor, however with the reopening of the last Spire… something is wrong. The world begins to fall apart, the heavens turn dark and the oceans go dry. In the aftermath of your deeds, you find yourself stranded in the middle of a deteriorating world, only thoughts of worry to comfort you, as you trek onward to get back to your kingdom. The journey back takes you three years. And when you arrive… you do not recognize your own kingdom. Forsaken and betrayed by your own Order, fight back against the forces of a long-forgotten realm as you try to save existence from the evil of a usurper king in pursuit of what lies beyond immortality in the Kings of Lorn: The Fall of Ebris.

However, they are much stronger than you. Large Array of Weapons Fight back using a variaty of weapons, from swords, axes and a war hammer to powerful staves and a life consuming ultimate weapon.

"","2024-09-04","PLAY FROSTPUNK: CONSOLE EDITION This version of the award-winning game from 11 bit studios is tailored to give console players the full Frostpunk experience: • Thanks to the special, dedicated controller scheme all important features of the game are quickly within your reach. • The Console Edition of the game already includes all the updates that have been released since its premiere on PC. THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.","2024-08-20","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000","85%","0","Strategy, Simulation, Strategy","0","null","null","Frostpunk: Console Edition","TRD","11 Bit Studios S.A.","2019-10-10","frostpunk-console-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","157.35","1","",

CREATING THE WORLD The world consists of blocks that you can place anywhere. Thanks to this, you will be able to think over a defense plan. BUILD TOWERS Tower locations are the most important aspect in tower defense games. This aspect becomes even more valuable in Block Tower: you can build towers on high ground, leave free blocks for resource extraction or later strong towers. In addition, all towers have an experience bar, the earlier you build it, the stronger it will be in the late game. CHOOSE UPGRADES The order in which upgrades are chosen in each game is very important. You can choose resource-based upgrades, magic tower upgrades, or upgrades for strong early defense, which will allow you to safely move into the late game. Combined with randomly generated blocks, this gives infinite replay value. RESOURCE MINING Think over your economic strategy. Early construction of economic buildings is risky, but gives a big boost in the late game. The random location of resources in each game sets new strategic questions that you will have to answer each time.","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202407/0912/c15bc2c51fabaa19796a0edfbebf59c23f924e1c77823200.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6138-CUSA48092_00-0303083378814996","25%","0","Strategy","144","null","null","Block Tower TD","TRD","Samustai LTD","2024-07-18","block-tower-td-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","192.00","0","144.00","1","",

With help from your robot assistant, you will appraise, value, buy and sell a vast array of items. But remember: there are no umbrellas allowed. AVAC will be watching… No Umbrellas Allowed is set in a futuristic sci-fi dystopia where greed is a crime and the emotions of the populace are suppressed by a drug called 'Fixer', which is administered via rainfall. Through a series of strange events, you find yourself in the position of manager at a well known second-hand shop called Darcy's. By learning the tools and tricks of the trade - and with some help from a loud-mouthed robot assistant - you must earn money, raise the shop's reputation, and pay off your debts, all while trying to avoid any unwanted attention from AVAC (Association for Victims of Avarice Crimes). EVALUATE: Customers will bring you a wide variety of items they want to sell, from the mundane to the marvelous. Use tools to discover an item’s true value: worthless junk or precious rarity? HAGGLE: Once you’ve decided an item’s value, you can negotiate a price for it. Try to strike a balance between keeping the customer happy and ensuring a deal is as profitable as possible for Darcy's. PROFIT: Procured items can be displayed for sale in the shop’s showcase. The rule of Darcy’s is buy low, sell high. But don’t get too greedy. Ajik City is not the place for flagrant avarice. REPUTATION: Consistently offering good item appraisals, good recommendations, and good deals all positively raises the profile of Darcy’s and brings more customers into the shop. Be good at your job. UMBRELLAS: Strictly prohibited in Ajik City due to their ability to protect against Fixerain. Any umbrellas submitted to Darcy’s must be handed over to AVAC. Failure to comply will be punished.","2024-08-27","/game/92276","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202307/2615/d44ac0076137566917239362e2fd00e8ec5b6966e09020c4.png?w=200","11","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8925-CUSA33737_00-0537447488349316","25%","0","Strategy, Simulation","299.25","null","null","No Umbrellas Allowed","TRD","DIGERATI DISTRIBUTION","2024-07-11","no-umbrellas-allowed-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","399.00","15","299.25","1","",

"","2024-09-11","Eternal Threads is a single-player, first-person story-driven puzzle game of time manipulation, choice and consequence. As an operative tasked with fixing corruption in the timestream, you have been sent to the North of England in May 2015, where six people died in a house fire. Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event. From the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely. You must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates. However, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone? Ultimately, everything is about choices and consequences. Features Choose how you want to follow the game’s story. The complete narrative follows the six main characters through multiple decisions across multiple timelines and you can experience these in any way you choose. You can concentrate on just one particular character’s storyline at a time, following their choices across the timelines and then go back to the start and follow another character. You can approach the story like a forensic detective, observe the final outcomes of the story and then work backwards along the timeline – essentially observing the effects and then determining their cause. Or you can just watch things in chronological order, experiencing the timeline unfold as you observe and change the decisions that the characters face as the week progresses. Watch and change things as many times as you like Can’t remember exactly what happened in an event? Changed a decision and you’re not sure you like the consequences? That’s fine. Just pop back along the timeline and watch and change whatever you like, whenever you like, as many times as you like. Change the past to affect the future Setting up temporary base in the house mere hours after the fire, provides a unique perspective on events. As you look back through the timeline, past events play out in front of you in ghostly form, with the smoke and fire damaged house a constant reminder of what is to come. In addition, as you manipulate the past, the environment can be reset around you to match the changes taking place. Some new objects will appear, others will move around the house and the contents of rooms can change substantially as you change the past.","2024-08-27","/game/107312","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202404/2215/24af702899a05af24e9ea708cfbdf71c661794c4c5bf61ce.png?w=200","7","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP7072-PPSA19317_00-ETERNALTHREADS01","25%","9","Adventure, Puzzle","524.25","null","null","Eternal Threads","TRD","Secret Mode Limited","2024-05-23","eternal-threads-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","699.00","8","524.25","0","",

"","2024-09-11","Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. Airstrip DLC It is more story-driven than what we did in the past and it allows you to build a small airstrip close to your gas station. Meet Joe Joe is an old pilot flying an old single engine plane. He is a bit strange and one day approaches you to help him with his endeavours. For that he needs a place to land in the middle of nowhere to make a stop halfway to his destination. In return he is willing to cut you in on his deals. The Airstrip You have plenty of space and as it turned out, there used to be an old military landing strip during WWII close to your gas station. Should be that hard to make it work again, right? You might even go a step further, order some aviation fuel and some parts for planes. A windsock wouldn’t probably hurt and some lights might turn out to be useful, since you will on occasion also need to help him land. Let’s see how things develop and what Joe is up to... The Plane Joe’s plane is like its pilot: old. It’s also simple. The most advanced technology on this thing is the LED reading light Joe uses to find his way on the chart. How hard can it be to fix some simple things on a small plane? And it’s not like you are doing it for free. The Gameplay The Airstrip DLC brings new game mechanics and content to Gas Station Simulator based on events. Unlike the content we introduced in the past, it does not require your constant attention, it is more something that happens every now and then.","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/0811/b8f13605c8c28858ee9edb0a090601b63229b7a90f139710.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6300-CUSA31829_00-0529173475105583","30%","0","Simulation","545.35","null","null","Gas Station Simulator and Airstrip DLC Bundle","TRD","MD GAMES SA","2024-05-16","gas-station-simulator-and-airstrip-dlc-bundle-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","839.00","0","587.30","1","",

By dint of sword, and by way of magical objects known as “rune-lenses,” the land’s history has been shaped by the alliances and aggressions of the humans, beastmen, elves, and desert people who live there. The Galdean Empire has edged out other nations and discovered a technology that amplifies the rune-lenses’ magic. Now, the Empire is scouring the continent for an artifact that will expand their power even further. It is on one such expedition that Seign Kesling, a young and gifted imperial officer, and Nowa, a boy from a remote village, meet each other and become friends. However, a twist of fate will soon drag them into the fires of war, and force them both to reexamine everything they believe to be right and true.

"","2024-09-11","In Celebration of Violence is a fantasy action roguelike of exploration and murder. The methodical combat requires that you plan your attacks, dodges, blocks, and parries while considering your opponents and the environment. Death is permanent but you can improve your stats and purchase items to aid future lives. And if things get too tough then up to four local friends can grab controllers and aid the hero as player-controlled monsters, zombies, and bandits. The World Large, procedurally generated, and interconnected lands range from plains to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons, you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area’s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items. One must choose carefully though; every god has a different price and some become displeased when their rival is the subject of worship. Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians. Variety Scores of weapons, items, spells, and mementos are scattered throughout the world to find. One may acquire a powerful enchanted ballista early into one life, only for the next to yield nothing more than a couple of wooden clubs. Mementos represent objects remembered from past lives and change the rules of gameplay. You may discover a memento that summons spiders from enemy corpses, improves your stats while on fire, or reverses the effects of death. There are multiple paths to victory. One could be nimble and stealthy, charge in waving a hammer, raise an army of undead, harness a variety of spells, manipulate enemies into traps or flames, amass resources to acquire the most powerful items, or simply play it safe with a sword and a shield. The various characters simply offer different starting points, every decision is your own. Challenge No life is predetermined for success. The cheery graphics disguise a brutal and unyielding experience. Unforeseen obstacles will need to be dealt with in real time and even a regular enemy will be deadly if you’re not careful. To reach the end, players will need to demonstrate that they are able to consistently overcome these obstacles. Failure can halt or even reverse progress. As you accumulate experience, discover schematics, and defeat bosses you can become permanently better prepared to tackle future challenges. The choices and advantages a player has at the beginning of a playthrough will dramatically increase as they play. New characters, items, and bonuses are unlocked in ways that are only hinted at during gameplay.","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/2711/594d0e532892337960f060de798e952ff115296f67d9f613.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6718-PPSA21627_00-0132056813808815","60%","0","Role-Playing","182","null","null","In Celebration of Violence","TRD","Dolores Entertainment S.L.","2024-03-14","in-celebration-of-violence-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","455.00","0","182.00","0","",

Your name is Kave, and you’re the chief of your tribe – or rather you were until now. Banished by your own people you stumble upon… a jetpack! The device turns you into the only caveman who stands a chance against “the alien invader” – a rather unlikable guy from the sky who’ll readily kick off a disastrous volcanic eruption just so he can repair his spaceship.

The Shadow forces seek to reignite the war that almost destroyed Celenheim and steal the sacred magic held within the walls of the Enclave. It is up to you to keep the light from being extinguished.

The legion of Darkness is ready and it is up to you to gain back what is rightfully yours. Begin your campaign as a soldier of the Light, defending Celenheim from forces of darkness and the horrid demon king Vatar.

"","2024-09-11","Respawn into a new dinosaur survival experience beyond your wildest dreams… as ARK is reimagined from the ground-up into the next-generation of videogame technology with Unreal Engine 5! You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it! FEATURES ARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically of off surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail. Advanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall. ARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island and Scorched Earth are released now, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis. The definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond. Thorough Quality of Life revamps in every area: redesigned User Interfaces, dynamic navigation for intelligent creature pathfinding, Wild Babies, Photo Mode, new Camera systems, new Map system, Tracking System, new Structures and Items, new Creatures, and much more. Cross-Platform Modding: Download & play new custom content created by players, including new maps, creatures, items, and game modes, through a dedicated new Mod-bowser directly within the game! Enjoy an endless stream of new ARK content as the creativity and talent of the community is fully unleashed for the first time ever across gaming platforms! Cross-Platform Multiplayer: form your online tribe across different gaming platforms as you work together to survive and thrive on the ARK!

"","2024-09-11","Start with a pickaxe in one hand and nothing in the other. Excavate the bedrock, reap the rewards of Mother Earth, and trade the mined valuables for new gadgets, travels, funky wild fashion, and more. Cave Digger 2 is a 1-4-player action-adventure game set in wildland valleys, where you discover old mines, nautical caves, and ruins of ancient civilizations inspired by Western, Dieselpunk and Lovecraftian themes. Explore the ""pristine"" lands, loot its riches, and unravel the mystery linked to a great explorer. As you go, it's best to keep a six-shooter nearby just in case. Tools and Progression Get thrown right away into the deep end by being stuck in the mines as your drill machine broke. With a single pickaxe, work your way to the surface camp where your journey can begin in earnest. Your goal is simply to mine and carry loot back to the surface the best you can for your mission assigners. With the surplus reward that you get, you can buy new things like upgrading your dependable pickaxe with a shinier look! (And faster digging rate.) Or buy dynamites that work on pretty much anything that needs to be worked on. Maybe you fancy a shovel that works for both digging and moving through the caves like a spider-miner. Whatever your preferred loadout, you will be ready to go deeper into the ever-shifting caves than any miner before or after you! Story The valleys have their mysteries and they hide them well. Step by step the player follows the same path where a great explorer has once wandered. Who is this hardy explorer? Why did he come to these valleys? And where is he now? The answers to these and more lie in the depths of the valleys. The story has multiple endings, each revealing a different side of it. Find the scattered comic pages to a tale of greed, eldritch power, and secrets beyond space and time. Who the wanderer is and why he did what he did in the valleys become clear in the end, but is it really the end? Co-op Multiplayer Gather a party of up to 4 players. Your role in the mining team is totally up to you! As long as at least somebody is carrying their weight in gold back to the surface, you all get paid in official Merchant Dollars equally. Co-op crossplay supports public matchmaking and private groups, and you are very free to show your wildlands drip by combining things from a generous selection of clothes, hats and faces once you've bought them first. So, take a pickaxe (and your friends) with you and head to the wildlands for the riches it holds, find out the secrets it contains, and dig deeper into the valleys than any adventurer before or after you! For the latest updates, exclusive sneaky-peeks, and 24/7 Saloon talks (memes),﻿ step into our Discord community -> discord.gg/cavedigger Features – Discoveries, dangers, and digging – Mine your way with the dependable pickaxe, versatile dynamites, hi-tech hammer, and more – Procedurally generated partially destructible cave and mine networks – Grab the six-shooter, chain-shovel, and the gold-pan-turned-to-a-shield if things get rough. TNT works fine too, just mind your team members if you aren't lone-wolfing! Gadgets evolve with upgrades. – 1-4 player crossplay co-op of private groups or public matchmaking, also between VR and non-VR – Collectable comic pages of Clayton - The Greed reveals the history of the Valley throughout the player’s journey – Multiple discoverable game endings, each revealing a different angle to the story – Player avatar customizing with dozens of things from clothes to faces to hats.

"","2024-09-11","The Absolute Evil and its trusted *cough* servant, the Dark Elf Thalya, return in Dungeons 4 after the events of its fabulous predecessor to bring about their triumph over the forces of good once more. Build a cozy and comfortable Dungeon to suit your creatures’ needs and rule over them, then send them out into the Overworld to kindly remind the good people living there that the Absolute Evil rules over their lands. Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise. But what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart. Dungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilness™. Features: • Everything is better with Dwarves™: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources. • It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons! • Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. • New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand. • Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time. • Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil. • Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes. • Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together. All maps from the skirmish mode and the campaign are playable in co-op.","2024-08-27","/game/134131","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0312/cc9b9859c73692c8ddbb19f5d922c0598070db16cb0b86de.png?w=200","25","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4365-PPSA07937_00-DUNGEONS40000000","20%","34","Strategy","1399.2","null","null","Dungeons 4","TRD","Kalypso Media GMBH","2023-11-08","dungeons-4-ps5","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","1749.00","34","1399.20","0","",

The evil emperor of Blobolonia™ is threatening to rule the planet with his army of minions. Thwart his plans for total conquest while forging an unbreakable bond by using the power of jelly beans!

Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That’s what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience unmatched. Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement. The Tightest Crew The legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. They've been ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake. In order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan. Give In to Your Greed Give your greed an outlet and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash, jewelry, and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics, and accolades.

Gain experience, unlock new skills, and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges. The Art of the Heist A professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work, and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist; do you sneak or go in guns blazing? Do you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns? Do you go it alone or bring friends? The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays out. Thrive in Co-op Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends, whether you bring them along from your childhood or make them along the road.

Get a babysitter for the kids, this game is a madcap, mile-a-minute spree of spies, dives, and gun-toting bad guys that will have you on the edge of your seat. You take on the role of Jack, a handsome, jaded former intelligence officer pulled out of his retired life as a strip club regular for one last mission to stop the villainous virologist Krueger, who plans to unleash a mind-controlling virus on the unsuspecting citizens of L.A. Everyone is out to kill Jack now that he’s hot on Krueger’s trail, and he’ll need to use his mind, muscles, and mojo to stay alive long enough to stop Kruger’s plot. Your spur-of-the-moment decisions will help or hinder Jack as he tries to find and protect the only scientist who has the cure to counter Krueger’s deadly bioweapon. A restoration and remaster of a game lost to time for over 25 years, American Hero was originally designed for the Atari Jaguar CD as a “playable movie” with a groundbreaking, more fluid presentation than the FMV games of its time. The game features the talents of professional actors, including Timothy Bottoms (The Last Picture Show, Johnny Got His Gun), Daniel Roebuck (The Fugitive, Final Destination), and Musetta Vander (O Brother, Where Art Thou, Wild Wild West). For this restoration, Timothy Bottoms reprises his role in newly recorded voiceovers of Jack’s inner thoughts heard throughout the game. This restoration was rebuilt from the ground up with new game logic that delivers on the ambitious promise of the original game. This edition of the game includes new voicework from star Timothy Bottoms to accompany the original footage, completing the American Hero experience for the first time. American Hero features: • An explosive and adult-oriented Hollywood production with intense action, spicy encounters, and gut-busting laughs • A winding player-directed plot with multiple paths and endings • A unique FMV format that plays smoothly like watching a film • The return of Hollywood actor Timothy Bottoms as Jack with newly recorded voiceover","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/2203/ejzKp9VIndGcgNyCzJyu60bv.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6260-PPSA09302_00-9439955969514772","35%","0","Action, Unique","341.25","null","null","American Hero","TRD","Ziggurat Interactive, Inc.","2023-07-04","american-hero-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","525.00","0","341.25","1","",

After meticulously analyzing Meat Boy all throughout Super Meat Boy Forever (did you notice the cameras in the levels???), the nefarious Dr. Fetus now has all the data he needs to create the perfect Meat Boy clone! There’s just one problem: The DNA sample he’s collected isn’t a perfect specimen, which in turn yields some…less than perfect clones… But fear not, Dr. Fetus knows how to solve this problem. He creates a bunch of ruthless test chambers and starts sending all of the clones he’s created through them, in order to weed out the crap clones from the good ones. The specimens start out looking nothing like Meat Boy, but over time that grotesquely lovable face that Dr. Fetus hates so much, starts to emerge. Perfect clones are just on the horizon and after they’re done…who knows what happens next? Probably something to do joyously with torturing and killing lots of Meat Boys for the hell of it!

"","2024-09-11","The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ is an official adaptation based on the literary works of J.R.R. Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose… How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring ™, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself… or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn't break; he bends, he adapts… Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It's up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","2024-08-27","/game/82092","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0314/3bfea22d60d10ee2ba3ab64ffbfe95a53ee9a133d0fcc77e.png?w=200","13","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG0000000000000","80%","18","Adventure","999999","null","null","The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™","TRD","NACON SA","2023-05-25","the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","15","419.80","1","",

Lay down pathways with new easy-to-use tools. Plant glorious collections of outdoor flora. The only limit is your imagination (and your in-game bank balance). Rather than typical academic fare, students in Two Point County enjoy a range of wild and wonderful courses: from Knight School (hey, we all have to learn jousting at some point in our lives), to the salivatory Gastronomy, where your students will build mouth-watering concoctions like giant pizzas and enormous pies. Build libraries, hire the best staff, kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked! But it’s not just work hard. Oh, no. It’s play hard, too. You’ll need to keep an eye on their happiness and make sure they’re getting enough entertainment, pastoral care and general joie de vivre to develop into incredible individuals who will do the legacy of your university proud.

Micro Challenge brings an entire new take on the unique puzzle series by adding new player movement options and new terrain tiles. Whether you are a fan of the series or a first time player, this is the perfect place to start. Micro Challenge is a uniquely set up movement based puzzle game, and your goal is to examine each level and determine the most efficient route possible to collect all items before reaching the move limit. Like in previous entries your Player Tile can Move, Double Slide, Diagonal Slide, Tilt, and Teleport. Micro Challenge also adds the ability to change sizes. Shrink your tile down to fit through narrow hallways and corridors. Be careful when you are small as there are now towers filled with holes, and if you try to traverse them while in the shrunken state, you will fall to your demise! It costs 1 energy unit to shrink or to grow. This creates an entire new style of puzzle design in which you must determine when it's most beneficial to change sizes in your route planning. Micro Challenge features the ability for the Tile to become ""micro"" but it is ALSO a ""micro"" sized Tilting Tiles game. Micro Challenge is designed to be a perfect starting point for the franchise. It features 20 unique levels and 5 creative multiplayer maps! Not only does Micro Challenge feature a focused and unique single player puzzle set, it also contains a series first, with the all new Tilting Tiles Multiplayer Mode. Grab a friend and solve your way through Tilting Tiles Maps together. Both players share a move count, so you must examine the level together and determine who can collect which items more efficiently. Each player is given a different set of problems to solve as well as a different amount of special moves available.

"","2024-09-11","This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game. It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build. If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product. Owners of a PS4™ disc copy must insert it into the PS5™ every time they want to download or play the PS5™ digital version.

Become Sherlock Holmes, and find yourself at the heart of the terrifying Cthulhu Mythos as you investigate a series of mysterious disappearances in Europe and the US. A Lovecraft meets Sherlock Holmes crossover, The Awakened puts you up against the legendary Cthulhu Mythos. Investigate a series of mysterious disappearances, apparently linked to a dark cult that worships an Ancient God. Whatever their plan is, you must put a stop to it… or face unspeakable consequences.

This edition also contains ""The Lethal Script"" case that will have the detectives investigating a movie industry mystery on The Peak Hotel. Put on your headphones and step back into the past.

And what's the mysterious thread weaving all of these cases together? A Unique Case-Solving Experience Discover the truth hidden in the voices from the past. Step through time as you use our device to eavesdrop on conversations from past crime scenes. Every clue, every move, and every motive will be presented in the form of audio.

Defend your city as five unique and devastating Kaiju grow in power with every attack. Unfortunately, they can't be killed, but can be slowed down and forced to fall back... for now. Monsters move towards the nearest building, and the scientists have mathed the exact odds of where they might go next. Build sacrificial army bases and airfields to distract the Kaiju. If standard methods aren't enough, deploy experimental weapons such as freeze rays and transforming mechas to keep them at bay. Or you can always park tanks and jets in the monsters’ path to slow them down (don't worry, we have a good insurance policy). If all your efforts fail, don't be ashamed and run away!

You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. ""IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN"" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels…) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones for your style and shred the most iconic spots!","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202312/0610/9c75daf101112bea773a57692d2d8e01bd2855d53ab81f5a.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06510_00-1798662863472577","70%","0","Simulation, Sport","629.7","null","null","Session: Skate Sim - Deluxe Edition","TRD","NACON SA","2022-09-22","session-skate-sim-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","2099.00","0","629.70","1","",

Competently upgrade your ship and set the right course – and you can stay alive for a certain amount of time, or maybe even break a record! * If you like branching plots and world exploration – boldly immerse yourself in the storyline. The CyberHive universe is a mysterious and deep setting. Collect ancient artifacts and pieces of knowledge on distant planets about the past – and discover how the world turned out to be and what misfortune it faces. Maybe you can avert it... or not. MANY EVENTS As you try to find resources and survive, you will experience many events on the ship: from intrigues within the crew and problems with passengers, to a large contraband “set-up” or a collision with the ghost of a legendary pirate starship. Some events form a story, and some occur randomly. But the choices within each event will also have to be considered... ...Subjects with the waist of a wasp and a deadly sting; predatory rivals and faction battles; exploring the farthest corners of the galaxy; dangerous challenges and responsible decisions. Welcome to the world of CyberHive! Commander, we are counting on you.","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/2312/DfIlU2yDcLaFI3lJl69ty00z.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6138-CUSA32422_00-8643474005770211","60%","0","Role-Playing","126","null","null","CyberHive","TRD","Samustai LTD","2022-06-17","cyberhive-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","315.00","0","126.00","1","",

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before. France, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken. EXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other. ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL Use ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target. HIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION Use workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal. INVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP Invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation. TENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER Customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode. ENHANCED KILL CAM More realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2812/ikX07BwP4iCsfPrSnqfQQ4qs.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4529-PPSA04444_00-SNIPERELITE500DE","70%","0","Fighting, Action","629.8","null","null","Sniper Elite 5 Deluxe Edition","TRD","REBELLION DEVELOPMENTS LTD","2022-05-25","sniper-elite-5-deluxe-edition-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","1","3149.00","0","944.70","1","",

"","2024-09-11","The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante is a narrative-driven RPG that comes to life on the pages of the protagonist's journal. Set in a ruthless world where any form of dissent is mercilessly crushed, the story follows a man who has dared to challenge the existing order. Set out on a lifelong journey and become an individual able to carve out their own destiny... But remember that freedom never comes cheap. Life in the Great Arknian Empire is harsh and its hardest Lot is yours by the circumstance of birth. You are a commoner, holding no rights and no title. To seize your fate and become the rightful heir to the legacy of the Brante family you will have to come to grips with ossified tradition and prejudice. Embarking on a life-long journey from one's birth until true death, you will have to endure great upheavals, face adversity, and make many difficult choices. Every decision will affect not only the protagonist, his family, and loved ones, but may even topple the foundation of the Empire itself. Key features At the turn of time Every imperial citizen's life is predetermined by their estate. The deities known as the Twin Gods have bestowed this truth to the world, dividing mortals into Lots. The nobles lead and rule over others, while the clergy guides people on the one true path, and the lowborn suffer, toiling away for the glory of the Empire. You may accept your fate without question, but it is also in your power to change the cosmic order that governs all. Your choice is not an illusion Divided into chapters, the game keeps track of the player's deeds, the skills they acquired, as well as other overlapping circumstances that shape a unique plotline for each playthrough. Every decision has its consequences and you will be held accountable throughout the entire journey. To protect your family and loved ones, to impose the rule of the Emperor and make a fortune, or to try and change the world as you see fit... Make your choice, but beware of the follies of pride and ambition. Fight for your life One man is anything but omnipotent in this realm yet under your guidance, Sir Brante may become a person who can endure every trial fate throws at him and rewrite the very laws that govern his world! Develop and train your character, leveling up such traits as determination, sensitivity, and endurance. All of the hero's skills, starting with those acquired in infancy, will affect his personality, worldview, and relationships, ultimately unlocking new talents and possible storylines. Find your own path The first complete walkthrough can take you upwards of 15 hours! Numerous branching paths that affect the unfolding story will make every playthrough a unique experience: become a noble judge, learn the ways of the inquisition, plot a revolution as a member of a secret society, or embrace an entirely different purpose. Be brave and fate itself shall bend to your will! There and hereafter Resurrection system allows the character to keep his experience upon death, letting the player reevaluate past steps and make adjustments to their strategy going forward. Take control not only of your life but also your demise, then put everything at stake in this cycle of death and rebirth!","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202201/2115/LcHtBrVEm4FvYAnsm3Ti2Ci4.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5036-CUSA31131_00-8779315563592274","60%","0","Role-Playing","262.5","null","null","The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante","TRD","101XP LTD","2022-02-10","the-life-and-suffering-of-sir-brante-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","875.00","0","350.00","1","",

It's been months since you last saw Theo, and she's incredibly excited to spend the weekend together. She invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just the get-together that you need to reconnect. Everything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he's bringing along an uninvited guest. Although Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's about the only thing you share in common... Will you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star?

A dreamlike journey into a surreal world of the artist’s own creations where the atmospheric gameplay provides mysteries to discover, puzzles to solve and artistic landscapes to explore. GAMEPLAY You find yourself on an evolving island. As you investigate your surroundings, the island will start to change.

This intriguing world within the canvas holds more mysteries than even the artist intended. STORY Prague July 20th 1945 The city of Prague was under siege, ravaged by war. Buildings were falling, churches were burning, and everything was to be washed away forever. A painter lived there, isolated from the outside world. The worse the terrors of war became, the more the artist obsessively painted beautiful landscapes as a contrast to the evil he had witnessed. One night, a mysterious figure appeared in the house seemingly out of nowhere. The stranger walked slowly around the room, inspecting the paintings. He then sat down in front of the artist; to offer him a deal. The chance to enter one of his own creations, far away and free of war. But he would have to find his way back out before midnight, or else his soul would become trapped in the canvas forever.

To combat these new threats, Operation ExZeus has been reopened with the legendary robots Calista, Sophia, and Dynamis being fused together to create the ultimate fighting robot, Minos. Dominate the land and skies as you take control of Minos to repel the alien threat, destroy the five pods, and defeat the invaders once and for all! • Give your trigger finger a workout and unleash your full arsenal of weaponry and super attacks against waves of invading alien forces. • Battle through urban cityscapes, dense forests, snow-covered mountains, desert wastelands, and even under the sea to eradicate the threat to mankind. • Take on giant bosses that will test your skills to their limit while you dodge a hail of attacks and take aim for their weak points. • Collect gold during your missions to spend on energy, shields, mega bombs, and more.","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/2621/ARfvXTt1ebeXTbaD0miVKnkf.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6260-CUSA27421_00-9216966129656834","35%","0","Shooter, Shooter","295.75","null","null","ExZeus: The Complete Collection","TRD","Ziggurat Interactive, Inc.","2021-09-30","exzeus-the-complete-collection-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","455.00","0","295.75","1","",

Now you must explore the dangerous and abandoned region of Isur and discover its secrets — as they are tightly connected to your own story. To explore the world you will need to use the power gained by combining nature’s four elements — fire, water, air, earth — with various ingredients. By crafting different potions, you will be able to explore the regions of Isur, solve alchemical puzzles, and fight dreadful enemies. Discover Isur Explore the devastated lands and uncover hidden secrets. Your journey will take you through four regions filled with quests, puzzles, enemies of all kinds and bits of lore that will help you to unlock the secrets of a seemingly forsaken region.

While playing, you will learn more about this strange land, your memories of it, and the disturbing connection between Isur and your own story. Feel the adventure Alchemist Adventure is a game that encourages you to experiment, think, and search for new things throughout your journey. There are no strict alchemical recipes, so you will be able to make your own unique potions and explore the possibilities of the rich alchemy system. As you progress, the challenge increases, and the number of save points decreases — and with no auto save, you will need to be careful, think ahead, equip yourself with the right potions for the job, and most importantly….watch your step! Key Features Discover a mysterious world — During the game you will explore different locations, from laboratories and dungeons, to a factory deep inside the heart of a volcano. Each region features unique challenges, sinister secrets, different enemies to fight, and lore to reveal. Concoct potions from the four elements — Use the four basic elements (fire, water, air, earth) along with special ingredients (from cuprum to nigredo) to create bombs, elixirs, and sword oils. There’s a potion for every task, and you can craft your own unique recipes! Transform the world around you — Interact with the environment using alchemy. Raise the water level of a lake, cross a river by creating ice platforms, use the wind to move objects, and create lightning to start an engine! Solve alchemical puzzles — Combine elements to open chests, make paths, or find hidden objects. Elemental monsters await — Use elements to discover enemies’ weaknesses and try different strategies to defeat them. Switch between characters or play co-op — Join the journey as a flying homunculus that can fight, solve puzzles, collect resources, and play with a friend!","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/0123/mjsGySgu6QXm0yoAcBVP6nbl.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5911-CUSA20231_00-CHEMISTADVENTURE","75%","0","Unique","139.8","null","null","Alchemist Adventure","TRD","SUPER DOT COM LTD","2021-05-20","alchemist-adventure-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","699.00","0","174.75","1","",

"","2024-09-11","Forget everything you know about first-person shooters: Void Bastards asks you to take charge, not just point your gun and fire. Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage... Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don’t worry though, as any crafting progress you’ve made is retained from one to another.","2024-08-27","","https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202004/0922/c2PFv5RzqHZ4L87K6BuGxnQW.png?w=200","0","Playstation","https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3717-CUSA16300_00-VOIDBASTARDSGMEU","70%","0","Arcade, Strategy","314.7","null","null","Void Bastards","TRD","Humble Games","2020-05-07","void-bastards-ps4","https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","0","1049.00","0","314.70","1","",

Breeder Homegrown is a short horror game about a family dealing with a strange creature over several generations. You will encounter some puzzles but the game relies mostly on atmosphere, music and dialogues. Perfect for people who enjoyed games like «To the Moon» or «Undertale» and want to spend an hour having a similar experience.

Up to 10 players can simultaneously fight in the Hexadiums, scenarios that are divided into 6 zones, each with its own gravity, different platforms, hideouts and open spaces, that turn them into a frenetic battlefield. In HIVE, we play the role of the best fighters of different factions that exist in the game: human military (UFG), human modified by Altenum (NHC), robots (EVO), and evolved aliens (YILL). These heroes, now called Hexadiers, have to conquer the hexagonal coliseum to obtain Altenum, a vital energy source for interspatial travelling in the 26th century. Win the battle and get fuel to survive, explore and colonize new planets! Each Hexadier has several inborn skills and a selection of weapons that can be equipped before entering battle.

You need to maneuver an ever-extending arm to grab the goal bottle, avoiding anything hazardous on the way. To make things more tricky, Grab the Bottle brings physics and puzzles to the mix. You must grab, pull and drop objects to get to the goal bottle. On the way you will find different kinds of obstacles that need to be dealt with. The story of the game begins in the 50s, somewhere in rural America, where one particularly strong minded baby is taking his first steps and discovers that anything is possible. Especially as he seems to have an infinitely stretchy arm. Grab the Bottle follows the life of this boy, from cradle to grave, solving many levels of puzzles inspired by “real life problems” on the way.
