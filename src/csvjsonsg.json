Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community. Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes,\" which were originally published separately, available now on PlayStation 4 for the first time.

Seen as the answer to all the kingdom\u2019s ailments, alchemy became a widely used practice across the land, with denizens welcoming it into their homes, using it to enhance and heal as they saw fit. When the price of alchemy became too steep, attempts to halt its use were made, each as woefully unsuccessful as the last, with the catastrophic consequences felt across the realm. Within days, the kingdom fell to chaos, infected monsters prowling the blood-soaked streets, all hope of a cure lost. Corvus is the kingdom\u2019s final hope, the fate of Hermes resting in his feathered hands. The truth is buried deep in the memories Corvus left scattered throughout the punishing world, and only by collecting these lost memories can the kingdom be saved, but each time he dives back in, trying to piece together the truth, all he finds is more secrets. Key Features Harness the plague: Seize plague weapons from gruesome bosses and formidable enemies, wielding them as deadly weapons. Giving enemies a taste of their own medicine will be the only way to survive the horrors that lurk in the shadows of the once thriving kingdom Embrace the Raven: Shift into your raven form during battle, throw feathers like daggers to interrupt your enemies\u2019 attacks, and perform executions with the swiftness of a raptor. Fight your way: Upgrade and modify Corvus\u2019 basic movements and plague weapons, build your very own playstyle, and prepare for the challenges that await in your own unique way. Unforgiving enemies: Corrupted by the plague, and mutated into monsters, enemies are twisted and incredibly hostile, challenging your ability at every turn.

Our old heroes are armed with a variety of homemade weapons and gadgets to take on anything the Grim Reaper and his Zombie army may throw at them. Can you survive the retirement village? Players must battle it out against The Grim Reaper and other competitors over a 13 race Championship, where only the most skilled racer will survive. There are 4 distinct areas within the Sunny Pines Retirement Community, each featuring it's own mini tournament in which your rank against other competitors will ensure you progress to the next stage; however finish bottom of the pile and the Reaper gets to take your soul. The final race takes place over each of the 4 areas in a straight shoot out between you and the Grim Reaper. As the game progresses the game environment becomes more and more apocalyptic as Grim's shadow slowly engulfs Sunny Pines. Look out for Grim's retinue of fiendish friends as they try and halt your progress. Collect XP throughout the Single Player Story Mode to gain Coins to spend in your very own Garage. Here you can upgrade your engine parts, paint jobs and even your weapons to get an edge over your competitors. Choose your mods carefully to suite your driving style!

Welcome to a suburban retirement village where all is not as it seems\u2026 After settling down to recover from the responsibilities of working life, the residents of Sunny Pines have been idling away the days, life could not be more tranquil. However, a creepy new resident, Mr Grim Reaper, looks set to turn retirement on its head. After years trawling the earth for souls to harvest, Mr Grim Reaper concludes Sunny Pines is where he\u2019ll lay his hat, where he can harvest souls from the comfort of his rocking chair. However, seven of the sprightliest senior citizens have other ideas and set out to prove that life for Grim in Sunny Pines definitely won't be like shooting fish in a barrel. The stately seven decide to strike a deal with the Grim Reaper; a mobility scooter racing championship to the death. If they can prove themselves to be fast and full of life, surviving and ultimately winning the championship, then he will allow them to live. However, too slow and they will be condemned to the retirement village in the sky. What the Reaper doesn\u2019t tell the folk of Sunny Pines is that once he takes your soul he can bring you back as one of his army of the living dead; mobility scooter racing zombies that are hell bent on making sure that nobody wins, by any means possible.

You only have a limited amount of stamina to use in order to reach the peak. If you run out of stamina or miss a hold you'll fall! But! The twist on the roguelike genre is that you never have to die. Careful players will try routes several times while clipping their rope to the wall before taking any risks. Skilled players will be those that find the right balance between risk and rationality and reach the peak in peace.

You take on the role of manager at a small (but growing!) talent agency. As you cultivate and train the newest generation of young pop stars, you'll have to decide who to hire and who to fire, who gets promoted and who gets reprimanded. The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always sunshines and rainbows. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their emotional meltdowns and PR nightmares can spell financial disaster for your company. It's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of gossip magazines, super fans, and rival groups, all thirsty for a scoop on the latest scandal. There's a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's nothing personal, it's just business. ■Idol Training Provide voice training and dance lessons to the idols you have scouted, and train them to become top-notch idols. Do you want a cool group or a cute group? Will the office control what they post on social networking sites? Or how long should their skirts be? You decide. ■CD Production Lyrics, musical arrangement, choreography, number of singers per group, who will be front and center? The players themselves will have to make the tough decisions, produce the music and CD, and then release it. Of course, watch how much funds you have before you end up in the red! ■Advertising Activities Your Idol\u2019s work isn't just to sing and dance in concerts. They may appear in magazines, TV, or livestreams on the Internet. Take on a wide variety of media outlets to increase your fan base! ■Office Management In addition to releasing single CDs, you can freely operate a cafe, theater, general elections, program production, and many other types of businesses. However, there is a limit to your funds. Be careful to not become a shoestring operation and watch your revenue! ■Complicated human relations Idol management is fraught with problems, such as scandals, media manipulation, and interpersonal relation issues between idol group members and outsiders. To avoid risks, form good relationships and aim for smooth office management. ■Fascinating Story The story is set in the Japanese entertainment industry, and there are many events outside the main storyline.

You take on the role of manager at a small (but growing!) talent agency. As you cultivate and train the newest generation of young pop stars, you'll have to decide who to hire and who to fire, who gets promoted and who gets reprimanded. The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always sunshines and rainbows. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their emotional meltdowns and PR nightmares can spell financial disaster for your company. It's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of gossip magazines, super fans, and rival groups, all thirsty for a scoop on the latest scandal. There's a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's nothing personal, it's just business. ■Idol Training Provide voice training and dance lessons to the idols you have scouted, and train them to become top-notch idols. Do you want a cool group or a cute group? Will the office control what they post on social networking sites? Or how long should their skirts be? You decide. ■CD Production Lyrics, musical arrangement, choreography, number of singers per group, who will be front and center? The players themselves will have to make the tough decisions, produce the music and CD, and then release it. Of course, watch how much funds you have before you end up in the red! ■Advertising Activities Your Idol\u2019s work isn't just to sing and dance in concerts. They may appear in magazines, TV, or livestreams on the Internet. Take on a wide variety of media outlets to increase your fan base! ■Office Management In addition to releasing single CDs, you can freely operate a cafe, theater, general elections, program production, and many other types of businesses. However, there is a limit to your funds. Be careful to not become a shoestring operation and watch your revenue! ■Complicated human relations Idol management is fraught with problems, such as scandals, media manipulation, and interpersonal relation issues between idol group members and outsiders. To avoid risks, form good relationships and aim for smooth office management. ■Fascinating Story The story is set in the Japanese entertainment industry, and there are many events outside the main storyline. You can even marry your idol! How this story ends, is entirely up to you. ■Free Play Style Free play with no storyline can also be used to avoid random events and love scandals. There are two unique difficulty levels: \"Relaxed,\" where you cannot go bankrupt, and \"Unfair,\" which makes it more difficult for players to make ends meet.

A dreamlike journey into a surreal world of the artist\u2019s own creations where the atmospheric gameplay provides mysteries to discover, puzzles to solve and artistic landscapes to explore. GAMEPLAY You find yourself on an evolving island. As you investigate your surroundings, the island will start to change. The appearance of a ship, the rise of a lighthouse, each mystery you uncover and puzzle you solve will unfold new wonders and unveil new places to explore. But be forewarned, the scene you find yourself in, this breathtaking land of paint and oil is not always as straightforward as it appears. This intriguing world within the canvas holds more mysteries than even the artist intended. STORY Prague July 20th 1945 The city of Prague was under siege, ravaged by war. Buildings were falling, churches were burning, and everything was to be washed away forever. A painter lived there, isolated from the outside world. The worse the terrors of war became, the more the artist obsessively painted beautiful landscapes as a contrast to the evil he had witnessed. One night, a mysterious figure appeared in the house seemingly out of nowhere. The stranger walked slowly around the room, inspecting the paintings. He then sat down in front of the artist; to offer him a deal. The chance to enter one of his own creations, far away and free of war. But he would have to find his way back out before midnight, or else his soul would become trapped in the canvas forever. Feeling alone, on the edge of madness, terrorized by the scent of death creeping in from the streets, the artist shook the mysterious man's hand, accepting the deal. A few moments later, the house was empty.

Spikes, traps, electric fences, and rings of fire are just some of the many dangers these daredevil soldiers must avoid over a total of 45 missions. You'll find yourself with three types of birds with different skills, but even the boldest won't make it through without your help.

Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny. In Evertried, the player\u2019s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don\u2019t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs.

Product Description To commemorate the 15th anniversary of the sword fighting action game series Onee Chanbara, the events of THE Onee Chanbara and THE Onee Chanbara 2 have been completely remade in full HD. The story of Aya and Saki, two sisters bound by mutual hatred and locked in a brutal fight to the death, has been revived and reimagined. Main character designer Katsumi Enami breathes new life into the characters, making this silky-smooth 60fps high-speed action game an unmissable treat. All shall be revealed in this reimagined rerelease of the games that started it all in OneeChanbara Origin! The Story In the year 20XX AD, Tokyo is nothing but a dystopic wasteland overrun by living corpses known as the Undead. Here we find two sisters who descend from a long line of expert swordsmen, yet were born to different mothers. The elder sister, Aya, was raised by her father, who subjected her to rigorous training in the way of the blade. Meanwhile, the younger sister, Saki, was raised by her mother, learning to despise her father for abandoning them and taking her sister away. When her father goes missing, Aya decides to put her skills with the sword to use as an Undead-hunter. Upon her beloved mother's murder, Saki becomes consumed to the point of insanity with a desperate thirst for revenge, resorting to manipulating the Undead to achieve her goal. Aya resolves to seek out her younger sister, her only surviving relation, while Saki is determined to resurrect her mother using an ancient art passed down through the ages. This art, however, requires the heart of a blood relative to work, meaning that the younger sister must kill the elder if she is to have her sworn vengeance. And so, amidst a swirling storm of love, hate, and intrigue, the battle between the two sisters begins.","SaleStarted":"2022-11-03","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/1212/Lz57SM6Pnqfd5vyDeXIKdZBx.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/product/HP5846-CUSA19217_00-ANEZ3GAMEEPP0000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Unique","PlusPrice":23.97,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/1212/Lz57SM6Pnqfd5vyDeXIKdZBx.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"OneeChanbara ORIGIN (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"SGD","Publisher":"CLOUDED LEOPARD ENTERTAINMENT INC.","ReleaseDate":"2020-09-24","Slug":"oneechanbara-origin-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-sg","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":79.9,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":23.97,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-18","description":"One day, a mysterious dungeon suddenly appeared in a peaceful town.

Razmi has decided to annoy Ajna by challenging her to do something impossible, promising a \u201creward.\u201d Ajna accepts the first challenge and after the player succeeds at it, Razmi claims it was part of 40 things you have to do, but Ajna remains optimistic and is willing to go through all of them. Razmi is discouraged by Ajna's continued success but is determined to make Ajna look foolish, so keeps coming up with new absurd challenges. As the player continues, other fan-favourite characters tell Razmi that it is getting to be too much, which Razmi stubbornly ignores. \u2022 Missions are gated by players\u2019 current story progress. These will be spread across the game for players starting from early on, with new sets of challenges unlocked at points in the story where they learn new abilities. \u2022 DLC will begin for players on a new save file once they have added Razmi to the party. DLC Overview: \u2022 40 self-contained challenge levels, each exploring mechanics from simple to advanced in a linear fashion. o World mechanic levels  Emphasizes combining learned moves such as Heruka Hustle (dash) into Pirate\u2019s Leap (high jump) in a series of challenges across a short linear level.  Each level assigns Ajna certain world traversal abilities and players must explore the imposed limitations. o Battle mechanic levels  Enemies with unique features that force the player to explore new ways to \u201csolve\u201d a battle  This will involve use of established battle mechanics, such as Iddhi meter building, Clean Blocking, and various \u201cbattle gimmicks\u201d like battle armor, physical attack resistance, and magic attack resistance. \u2022 Two new palettes. \u2022 New trophies and achievements. \u2022 A comic side-story with Ajna and Razmi as a framing device. \u2022 2-3 hours of content when played straight through (levels taking 3-5 minutes in one go) but the emphasis is on providing a challenge to the player so multiple re-tries should be expected. \u2022 Challenges will however start much easier and ramp up in difficulty as they are unlocked across the main game.

From the team that brought you SENRAN KAGURA and VALKYRIE DRIVE comes the brand-new Kandagawa Jet Girls Project! Kandagawa Jet Girls is an exhilarating racing game that takes place in a fictional version of Tokyo, sometime in the near future. A hot-blooded story unfolds among teams of young girls who pilot river-running jet machines. Teams consist of a Jetter, who pilots the jet machine, and an offensive Shooter, who attacks opponents with their water guns from the jet machine\u2019s rear. Together, these teams dash into the water in competitive jet races! Explore myriad courses across Tokyo, customize your characters and machines, and challenge Time Attack Mode! Up to four players can compete against their rivals in online matches. --- Enter Rin Namiki, a young lady whose mother was once a legendary Jetter. She dreams of becoming a jet racer herself, leaving her home island and setting out to Asakusa, Tokyo. She encounters the aloof and beautiful Misa Aoi, and the two become partners. Little by little, the two deepen their bond as they race against 12 rivals. This is the story of passionate girls, devoting their youth to the jet races. An all-new story awaits, with twists and turns that deviate from the anime adaptation.

In secret, they fill the roly-poly world with light and life. But when their existence is discovered, they become hunted. Emil, a trader for odds and ends, made all the Asposians believe that the dynasty is in cahoots with dark forces. The only one who can stop the evil Emil is the heir to the throne: Robert.
