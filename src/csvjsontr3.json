You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethan\u2019s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into. Inspired by the weird fiction and other tales of the macabre from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games.

Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You\u2019ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\u2019ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows? Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\u2019ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You\u2019ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it. Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you'll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-19","LowestPrice":"/game/51108","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1322/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png?w=200","MainStory":8,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP3376-CUSA20594_00-SSVISAGEGAMEPACK","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-AJjWF58AY","PercentOff":"45%","Completionist":15,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":19.24,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1322/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/visage","Title":"VISAGE","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"SadSquare Studio Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2020-10-31","Slug":"visage-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":34.99,"MainExtra":11,"SalePrice":19.24,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"80","SaleEnds":"2022-11-03","description":"Darkwood is a challenging survival horror that does not rely on jump scares.

Fear the Presence, a mysterious entity you cannot fight: stay alert, hide, breathe slowly... Explore cursed places where unseen spirits and lost souls linger in a true horror story for the ages. The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for him \u2013 but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The Presence seems to be responsible. Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience. Experience unbearable fear as an otherworldly being, The Presence, responds to your way of playing and hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted sequences. As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different, and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can die if the Presence gets to them \u2013 and death is permanent.

Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne. Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.

This leads you straight into the middle of an exciting murder case and a murder mystery unfolds while you listen to the testimonies of witness, friends and relatives. The whole game is somewhat Christmas flavored - however, don't get yourself comfortable, the game not going to give you a nice and warm feeling but rather confront you with a cold and harsh reality as the thrilling storytelling of the game will leave you with a cold shiver down your spine. The game is a must have for any true fan of thrillers and anyone how enjoys a murder mystery that goes beyond the normal story telling. How does the gameplay work? You will play as a free-floating ghost like creature. Basically, as the soul of someone who is experiencing the story. You are very small in comparison to the surroundings and can fly freely through the area. You start by exploring the area and enjoying the feeling of flying as well as the gentle yet mysterious background music. Soon after starting to explore, you will find the first memory piece. You can collect the memory pieces to continue with the story and to advance with the overall narration. The story talks about a young boy, about his live and about how everything changes. It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. The first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become. Once you have finished a chapter by collecting all memory pieces and finishing the overall story of a level you will continue into the next chapter.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-19","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/0713/MdykcFBrVbTsRxO86dAiH7Uh.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6557-CUSA31172_00-5678348502049271","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Horror, Unique, Simulation","PlusPrice":6.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/0713/MdykcFBrVbTsRxO86dAiH7Uh.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Murder Diaries 3 - Santa's Trail of Blood","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"EpiXR Games UG","ReleaseDate":"2021-12-17","Slug":"murder-diaries-3--santas-trail-of-blood-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":13.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":6.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-03","description":"THE NEXT CHAPTER IN FEAR Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Security Breach is the latest installment of the family-friendly horror games loved by millions of players from all over the globe.

Explore corridors dyed twilight crimson, witness the ethereal glow of -amber through paper walls of a traditional Japanese house and escape creeping black shadows in hospital rooms where the power is somehow always out. ◆Hide or die 10-year-old Ai has no defensive measures to defeat the enemies you face; instead, you must take advantage of each spirit\u2019s weaknesses to survive. Hold your breath to sneak past blind foes or dash past deaf ones as quick as your little legs can carry you. And if you can\u2019t get away in time, prepare to suffer a dire fate at the hands of unimaginable forces. ◆A tragic tale of friendship, betrayal and facing your demons Mute and anxious, Ai is grateful when she makes a group of friends to play with. But it turns out that the ghostly apparitions trapped in the world of dusk aren't the only things she has to contend with; ghosts can be cruel, but children even more so. Your classmates harbour dark thoughts and harrowing secrets that you must uncover to progress. Throughout the game, Ai will learn more about her new friends than perhaps she'd care to know... ◆If only there were another way\u2026 Upon clearing the game, another ending will become available to you. What story will this new path unveil? Slipping back into the terrifying world of Yuoni will see you face considerably more challenging foes for an even greater reward.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-19","LowestPrice":"/game/97173","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/1901/3dX5u5FMCL78N4VpYUXkQPfD.png?w=200","MainStory":4,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5258-PPSA02511_00-CHOR000000020DUS","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure, Horror","PlusPrice":8.79,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202107/1901/3dX5u5FMCL78N4VpYUXkQPfD.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Yuoni","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Chorus Worldwide Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-08-19","Slug":"yuoni-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":21.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":8.79,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-03","description":"Blair Witch: VR Edition is a story-driven psychological horror game based on the cinematic lore of Blair Witch.

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality. In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.

It's like a human's essence that can\u2019t be measured by a staged photo. And thus Glittering Sword is not that kind of game that some may think judging by screenshots or trailer.

Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it\u2019s shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: «fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher. We hope that players who are addicted to adventure games will fall in love with this small but very entertaining game.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-19","LowestPrice":"/game/98018","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/0517/xwozsdQiItXnb99GL6CpCKpO.png?w=200","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6537-CUSA26244_00-8444220691372937","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":3,"genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":1.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/0517/xwozsdQiItXnb99GL6CpCKpO.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Glittering Sword","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"CHILIDOG INTERACTIVE LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-05","Slug":"glittering-sword-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":4.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":2.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-03","description":"The Champion of Gaia pack includes: - 3 outfits for Cahal - 4 exclusive furs for the Wolf and Werewolf - A nature spirit to help you in combat - A unique finishing move","SaleStarted":"2022-10-19","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/3009/iOiXETyWC3CbdUzefwTzVkBv.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4008-CUSA16865_00-WTASIEADLC000002","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":6.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/3009/iOiXETyWC3CbdUzefwTzVkBv.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood Champion of Gaia Pack","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-04","Slug":"werewolf-the-apocalypse--earthblood-champion-of-gaia-pack-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":12.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":6.49,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-03","description":"The Champion of Gaia pack includes: - 3 outfits for Cahal - 4 exclusive furs for the Wolf and Werewolf - A nature spirit to help you in combat - A unique finishing move","SaleStarted":"2022-10-19","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/3009/iOiXETyWC3CbdUzefwTzVkBv.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4008-PPSA02114_00-WTASIEADLC000002","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Unique","PlusPrice":6.49,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202011/3009/iOiXETyWC3CbdUzefwTzVkBv.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Werewolf: The Apocalypse - Earthblood Champion of Gaia Pack","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-04","Slug":"werewolf-the-apocalypse--earthblood-champion-of-gaia-pack-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":12.99,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":6.49,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-03","description":"This DLC includes: - The exclusive Cahal The Exiled One outfit - Dark fur for the Werewolf and Wolf - An Auspice of Ahroun emblem embroidered on the outfit Exile was the only option to protect his family.

She came home to unimaginable horrors that left their mark. Now she walks, haunting and vengeful, between this world and the next. Adam Francis has no legacy, no inheritance.

But nothing prepared him for this course. If you already own the PS4™ version of this game, you can get the PS5™ digital version at no extra cost and you do not need to purchase this product.

SYSTEM REDUX Veteran Observers can dive deeper into this dystopian reality thanks to three brand-new side cases to solve. \u201cErrant Signal\u201d, \u201cHer Fearful Symmetry\u201d and \u201cIt Runs in the Family\u201d add another layer of depth to the game\u2019s story while exploring thought-provoking themes of a future that soon might become our present.

Newcomers get the chance to experience one of the most thrilling cyberpunk stories in all its next-gen glory: boasting 4K resolution, upgraded textures, new animations, models and effects, and transformed with jaw-dropping Ray-Tracing and HDR lighting. WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects\u2019 minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion. But remember, no matter how deep you go, you can never hide from an Observer.","SaleStarted":"2022-10-19","LowestPrice":"/game/82626","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4176-PPSA02118_00-8840415776217330","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RseKlXtD8cE","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":13,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Observer: System Redux","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Bloober Team","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-12","Slug":"observer-system-redux-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":14.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-11-03","description":"Dead Dungeon is a hardcore 2D platformer in the best traditions of classic games, with an excellent chiptune soundtrack.
