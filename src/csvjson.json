The story of Blaster Master Zero 2 begins a few months after the events of the first game (released on March 9, 2017), where the main protagonist Jason saves planet Earth from the mutants. Eve has been infected by mutant cells that are slowly corrupting her body, so together with Jason and Fred, they board G-SOPHIA and begin an intergalactic journey to Eve's home planet, Sophia, in hopes of finding a cure for the mutant infection.

As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning, and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy. The journey begins when a farmer and her son are attacked by bandits who raze their farm to the ground. The mother decides to leave the boy at a secluded monastery to protect him.

In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from the six displayed. This card gives the player a resource, and also has an action which the player takes immediately. Actions help players take over the map, but the resources are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects. Players spread across the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majority control in regions and continents. \u2022 Recruit troops to strengthen your army \u2022 Command your forces to acquire new provinces \u2022 Challenge your friends all over the world \u2022 Sail across the seas & build castles to expand your empire \u2022 Eliminate enemy troops to weaken your adversaries \u2022 Collect goods to increase your advantage[/list] AWARDS & HONORS Our digital adaptation: \u2022 2017 Golden Geek Best Board Game App Nominee \u2022 2017 Golden Geek Best Mobile/Handheld Nominee The board game: \u2022 2013 Golden Geek Best Family Board Game Nominee \u2022 2013 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Nominee \u2022 2014 Gioco dell\u2019Anno Nominee \u2022 2014 Hra roku Nominee Eight-Minute Empire: Complete Edition features all additional content released to date: \u2022 Eight-Minute Empire base game \u2022 Mountains Expansion \u2022 Old Europe Map \u2022 Archipelago of Azra Map \u2022 Southern Plains Map \u2022 Starfall Crater Map \u2022 Isthmus of Gom Map Features: \u2022 official Eight-Minute Empire game \u2022 great artwork \u2022 ingame interactive tutorial \u2022\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_EightMinuteEmpire_enGB_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/eight-minute-empire-complete-edition-switch/","platform":"Switch","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"60%","genre":"Board Game,Strategy,Multiplayer,Party","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"9.00","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_EightMinuteEmpire_enGB.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"97.60","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"450","Title":"Eight-Minute Empire: Complete Edition","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Acram","ReleaseDate":"2019-08-27","Slug":"eight-minute-empire-complete-edition-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 5 players","PolandPrice":"23.60","ChilePrice":"","Price":"14.99","MexicoPrice":"115.60","SalePrice":"5.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-03-10","LowestPrice":"3","SaleStarted":"2022-02-17","description":"Nyanzou always makes a mess of things.

Players with a tactical approach will also be able to build a base \u2013 by constructing additional hangars and supporting structures and then ensuring their safety by building anti-aircraft artillery and barrage balloons. There\u2019s all this, plus over 30 historical airplanes at their disposal: from classic fighters to light and heavy bombers which they can fly, repaint, customize, and upgrade. Included in the collection are the Spitfire, Hurricane, Lancaster, II-2 \u201cShturmovik\u201d, La-5FN, Ju-87 \u201cStuka\u201d, Fw 200 \u201cCondor\u201d, and a Nintendo Switch™ exclusive \u2013 the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk.

Earn coins to obtain improvements in the integrated shop system and to buy new towers. History: In a once very peaceful village, a strange professor tried to build a machine (Arcade Klonomat) that was intended to clone cows and increase milk production. Already in the first tests, he found out that cows could not be cloned due to the high protein content of the milk. In short, the professor secretly sank the Arcade Klonomat in a nearby swamp. Favored by toxic fumes from the waste stored there from the local nuclear power plant, the Arcade Klonomat has been creating terrible swamp monsters since that day who wreak havoc in the neighborhood. Courageous villages fight an almost hopeless fight against the spawn of the swamp without suspecting that the valued professor is to blame for this problem. Instead of trying to find a solution, he built an Arcade Klonomat for people and demanded money for its use. Since this is only a very small village, the few residents are forced to clone themselves in order to compete against the swamp monsters as an army.
