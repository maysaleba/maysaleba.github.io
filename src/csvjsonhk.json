In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop. DESIGNED FOR THE PS5 DEATHLOOP is built for a new generation, leveraging the PlayStation 5's hardware and graphics to bring Arkane\u2019s unique artistic vision to life like never before. DEATHLOOP takes advantage of new cutting-edge features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to make each encounter feel unique and impactful. IF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you\u2019ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you\u2019ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted. SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER Are you the hero or the villain? You\u2019ll experience DEATHLOOP\u2019s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you\u2019ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you\u2019re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna\u2019s stylish sneakers and invade another player\u2019s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign. THE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF \u2013 PARADISE OR PRISON Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself.

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip. KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community. Originally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes,\" which were originally published separately, available now on PlayStation 4 for the first time.

Explore the nature of good and evil, learn the true cost of power, and rise as a Mythic Hero capable of deeds beyond mortal expectations. Discover the Story Your path will lead you to the Worldwound, where the opening of a rift to the Abyss has unleashed all-consuming terror across the land. For over a century, the neighboring nations have fought fearlessly, trying to drive the enemy back \u2014 but to little avail. Now, you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel, backed by noble paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else entirely? Lead your army and challenge mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will leave you \u2014 and the world itself \u2014 forever changed. PLAY YOUR HERO, YOUR WAY Create any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset. Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle.

Who will stay, and who will go? Make your choices, and watch the world around you change. A NEW WAY TO FIGHT Enjoy two combat modes as you slay your enemies \u2013 real-time with pause or turn-based.

And if you get on their bad side, well\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s time to part ways. LEAD THE CRUSADE You will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of its demonic scourge.

CHOOSE YOUR PATH Explore nine unique Mythic Paths: obtain extraordinary abilities and shape everything that comes next. Your decisions might transform you into a celestial Angel, a raging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, an otherworldly Aeon, a rebellious Azata, a wise Gold Dragon, an insatiable Swarm That Walks \u2014 or remain mortal and walk the arduous path toward becoming a living Legend.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/83856","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/0418/aC9jmq4nJFtNWTjUcTW9h23h.png?w=200","MainStory":52,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/EP6008-CUSA35021_00-3515132086703036","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoCBgO8qS70","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":191,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":238.8,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202108/0418/aC9jmq4nJFtNWTjUcTW9h23h.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous","Title":"Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (Simplified Chinese, English)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"Postmeta Games Limited","ReleaseDate":"2022-09-28","Slug":"pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-simplified-chinese-english-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":398,"MainExtra":129,"SalePrice":278.6,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"80","SaleEnds":"2023-01-18","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4™ version and the digital PS5™ version of this game. * There is also a set product that includes this content.

Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/87808","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/UP0102-CUSA24159_00-MAKAIRE000000001","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F177-VTSGSM","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":22,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":114,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection","Title":"Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection (Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"Capcom U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-31","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-simplified-chinese-english-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":228,"MainExtra":7,"SalePrice":114,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2023-01-18","description":"◆Story Reincarnation is the foundation of our way of life.

With an emphasis on culture and character, ANOTHER SIGHT focuses on the emotional development of the relationship between its two protagonists, Kit, a refreshingly intrepid teenager, and Hodge \u2013 a mysterious red-furred cat. They meet in the darkness of a London Underground construction site, after Kit loses her sight when the tunnel she had been exploring collapses. They team up for an adventure into the unexpected, with Hodge proving himself to be an indispensable companion, upon whom Kit will come to rely. Kit and Hodge explore a surreal fantasy world, both together and separately, each using their own unique talents to make their way through compelling environments, and to solve intriguing puzzles. Beneath London, in a world inspired by Neil Gaiman\u2019s urban fantasy, Neverwhere, Kit and Hodge encounter a hidden society made up of the world\u2019s greatest inventors and finest artistic minds, including Claude Monet, Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison and other historical cultural icons. Another Sight Gameplay Features: AN EMOTIVE ADVENTURE \u2013 A story about a girl and her cat companion on a journey beyond sight and the real world. A tale of affection and intrigue is woven throughout the adventure, touching on trust and companionship, and the consequences of losing what we take for granted. The innovative gameplay and emotional story are galvanized through a soundscape brought to life by a symphonic orchestra, emphasizing the most memorable moments on Kit and Hodge's emotional and physical journey. MASTERS FROM THE PAST - Throughout their journey, Kit and Hodge will meet celebrated virtuosos such as Claude Monet and other historical cultural figures, and learn more about the world and the dangers it presents. These encounters have a visual impact on the world, as Kit's perception alters according to the aesthetics of each famous character's creative movement. NARRATIVE-DRIVEN GAMEPLAY \u2013 Use the unique abilities of each character to help Kit and Hodge traverse the world and overcome environmental challenges. Kit and Hodge can split up to investigate different areas of the locale that the other may not be able to reach, with both Kit and Hodge perceiving the world in very different ways, opening up different possibilities for overcoming the obstacles they are faced with on their adventure.

And so, nearly all resources were consumed, and the loved ones had perished. Humanity was spent... Much like the sand dunes piled by ceaseless winds, despair grew within the hearts of the survivors. Soon, humanity was on the brink of extinction, its fate all but sealed. Then one day, the people remembered an old legend, passed through generations.

Our old heroes are armed with a variety of homemade weapons and gadgets to take on anything the Grim Reaper and his Zombie army may throw at them. Can you survive the retirement village? Players must battle it out against The Grim Reaper and other competitors over a 13 race Championship, where only the most skilled racer will survive. There are 4 distinct areas within the Sunny Pines Retirement Community, each featuring it's own mini tournament in which your rank against other competitors will ensure you progress to the next stage; however finish bottom of the pile and the Reaper gets to take your soul. The final race takes place over each of the 4 areas in a straight shoot out between you and the Grim Reaper. As the game progresses the game environment becomes more and more apocalyptic as Grim's shadow slowly engulfs Sunny Pines. Look out for Grim's retinue of fiendish friends as they try and halt your progress. Collect XP throughout the Single Player Story Mode to gain Coins to spend in your very own Garage. Here you can upgrade your engine parts, paint jobs and even your weapons to get an edge over your competitors. Choose your mods carefully to suite your driving style! Once you\u2019ve built the mean machine that\u2019s right for you, head over to the Local Multiplayer Race Mode (2-4 players) where you can battle it out with your friends on the big screen. Welcome to a suburban retirement village where all is not as it seems\u2026 After settling down to recover from the responsibilities of working life, the residents of Sunny Pines have been idling away the days, life could not be more tranquil. However, a creepy new resident, Mr Grim Reaper, looks set to turn retirement on its head. After years trawling the earth for souls to harvest, Mr Grim Reaper concludes Sunny Pines is where he\u2019ll lay his hat, where he can harvest souls from the comfort of his rocking chair. However, seven of the sprightliest senior citizens have other ideas and set out to prove that life for Grim in Sunny Pines definitely won't be like shooting fish in a barrel. The stately seven decide to strike a deal with the Grim Reaper; a mobility scooter racing championship to the death. If they can prove themselves to be fast and full of life, surviving and ultimately winning the championship, then he will allow them to live. However, too slow and they will be condemned to the retirement village in the sky. What the Reaper doesn\u2019t tell the folk of Sunny Pines is that once he takes your soul he can bring you back as one of his army of the living dead; mobility scooter racing zombies that are hell bent on making sure that nobody wins, by any means possible.

It is a place of pain, turmoil and death. Plumb its detestable depths and abominable history. Untangle riddles that bar your perilous path. And flee the hellish halls of The Witch\u2019s House. The Witch\u2019s House, originally released in 2012, falls within the tradition of Japanese horror RPGs with heavy emphasis on puzzle-solving and jump scares. Among other entries in the genre such as Ib and Ao Oni, The Witch\u2019s House surprised fans with pixel-art that conceals truly frightening horror. The Witch\u2019s House is deliberately designed with traps at *almost* every turn--sudden death is unpredictable and it keeps players on their toes. Anything can happen at any time. With completely remastered visuals, The Witch\u2019s House MV will feel fresh to even the most familiar old-school fans.

You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street skating \u2013 the 1990s \u2013 Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. \"IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN\" Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen\u2026 In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.).

[Game Description] The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki is a completely new game in the Kiseki series. The sprawling Republic of Calvard is experiencing an unprecedented economic boom brought on by post-war reparations. At the same time, feelings of uncertainty stemming from a massive influx of immigrants and bold political reform by the new president are rife. Deep within its capital city, a young Spriggan man receives a strange request that threatens to plunge the entire nation into chaos\u2026 [Prologue] The Spriggan is a type of undeground agent, born in the melting pot of diversity that is the Republic of Calvard. Spriggans take on any and all requests, acting as detectives, negotiators, or even as bounty hunters. They subcontract requests that the police can't handle, consult with citizens on matters that can't be brought to light, and even take on legitimate requests from criminals and underground forces. This earned them the apt nickname \"jack-of-all-trades\". In the year 1208, a well-to-do student dressed in the uniform of a prestigious school visits an old building located deep within the Republic's capital. The girl stares at the plaque, upon which Arkride Solutions Office is emblazoned in plain letters. She clears her throat and then knocks three times. \"How odd, we don't receive many callers before noon...\" The calm voice of a surprisingly young, though mature-sounding man is heard from within, and the doorknob slowly starts to turn. And thus, our story begins.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/0701/6K0WE5g3uTqE92ribQ39uWwi.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/HP5846-PPSA07728_00-KURONOKISEKIDE01","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":"","genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":454.3,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202207/0701/6K0WE5g3uTqE92ribQ39uWwi.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki Digital Deluxe Edition (Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"CLOUDED LEOPARD ENTERTAINMENT INC.","ReleaseDate":"2022-07-27","Slug":"the-legend-of-heroes-kuro-no-kiseki-digital-deluxe-edition-traditional-chinese-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":649,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":454.3,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"Get ready to blaze through your enemies with as much firepower as you can carry!

Man Meets Magic & Machine In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It\u2019s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed.

Experience the new online mode with weekly challenges and leaderboards. In Solo mode, you can now deal with incidents (injuries, illnesses) during the 92 stages available. BECOME A LEGEND In Tour de France 2022, you can create your own cyclist in Pro Leader mode. Choose your profile (climber, sprinter, puncher or versatile) and become a future winner of the Grande Boucle or a specialist of the great classics! Take control of a team in Pro Team mode! You start at the lowest levels and must prove yourself to receive invitations from organizers to high-profile races. Create your own tour with My Tour mode and the 92 stages available. Choose teams, rest days and stages to build your own unique tour. NEW FEATURES - New online mode with leaderboard - Race incidents (falls, illnesses\u2026) - New preparation system - New interface on cobbled sections - More intense races with a more aggressive peloton and more collaborative breakaways - All 21 official stages of the Tour de France 2022 - New \"\"Primavera Classic\"\" inspired by a major Italian race - 3 new teams: Eolo-Kometa Cycling Team, Caja Rural-Seguros RGA and Uno-X Pro Cycling Team- NEW ONLINE MODE: RACE OF THE WEEK Enjoy a new challenge each week, competing against players from all over the world as you try to reach the top of the leaderboard! The controllable team and objectives \u2013 e.g. win the overall classification, score more points in mountain stages \u2013 differ based on the race. NEW: RACE INCIDENTS You can now choose to enable or disable race incidents and their consequences. If you enable them (for yourself and your opponents or just your opponents), you can choose their frequency and enable or disable their consequences, which vary depending on the incident's severity: loss of power for a short or long duration, or even withdrawal. Be prepared to adapt because your strategy might need to be completely re-evaluated at any moment. NEW: RACE PREPARATION To add more unpredictability to races, a new preparation system has been added. Five random cyclists (from your team or in the peloton) will be especially well prepared for the race and five others may potentially underperform. Unfortunately, you can't know who these cyclists will be\u2026 You will need to keep an eye on all your opponents. OTHER IMPROVEMENTS To make the cobbled sections of races more immersive, we have added shuddering to the entire user interface. This new feature reflects the difficulty of cobbled sections. You have never experienced the Arenberg trench quite like this! In Tour de France 2022, the races are more intense than ever, with even bigger early breakaways and better collaboration in all breakaways. You will need to adapt your strategy accordingly!","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202204/1509/v8sC3bO3hwhM164YQUWE3ngc.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/EP6665-CUSA32196_00-TDF2200000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Simulation, Sport","PlusPrice":199,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202204/1509/v8sC3bO3hwhM164YQUWE3ngc.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Tour de France 2022 (English)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-09","Slug":"tour-de-france-2022-english-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":398,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":199,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"Face the Unknown with style.

With the aid of weapons, spells and tonics, and the guidance of the magical and mysterious Beatrice, you will explore a dark and dangerous world, battle hideous monsters, and topple incredible bosses. A young girl wakes up in a dimly lit dungeon without any of her memories. Surrounded by horrible, bloodthirsty monsters, the girl is rescued by the magician, Beatrice. With Beatrice\u2019s help, the girl goes on a perilous journey to find answers, and unlock the secrets of the Lost Ruins. Combat Combat in Lost Ruins is in real time, and can be both fast and methodical. Slash away at enemies, burn them to a crisp, or even deflect their projectiles back at them. Arm yourself with a variety of swords, axes and other assorted medieval weaponry, and hack monsters to pieces. For those with an affinity for magic, Lost Ruins allows you to cast a variety of spells through wands, tonics, and scrolls. Burn monsters, freeze bosses, and heal yourself when in danger. Choose what works for your playstyle, and make a magic casting character that\u2019s totally your own. Using the Environment As you explore the depths of Lost Ruin\u2019s dimly lit dungeons, you will find that while everything around you might bring about your death, you can also use the environment around you to your advantage. Elements within the world will react with other elements realistically. Flammable liquids will be set ablaze when in contact with lit lanterns. Ice magic will freeze bodies of water, making them dangerously cold. The more you understand the environment and how to use it to your advantage, the more dangerous you will become. Equipping Yourself The world of Lost Ruins is a dangerous one, and being armed to the teeth with awesome weaponry is sometimes not enough. That\u2019s where accessories come in. Accessories are unique pieces of equipment with all manner of effects. One accessory might protect you against fire, while another might heal you when you\u2019re poisoned. The right combination of accessories can open a world of strategic options for your adventure.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/88780","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1310/JdwA9IKvVUJ3x7jC9AxwfEu1.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/JP4108-CUSA29271_00-LOSTRUINSJP00000","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijk9Lzad_zE","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":15,"genre":"Action, Adventure","PlusPrice":88.8,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202205/1310/JdwA9IKvVUJ3x7jC9AxwfEu1.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Lost Ruins (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese, Traditional Chinese)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"Dangen Entertainment Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"2022-06-05","Slug":"lost-ruins-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-traditional-chinese-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":148,"MainExtra":7,"SalePrice":88.8,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"\u2014 Unique armoured car: \u201cValley doctor\u201d; \u2014 New weapon of epic rarity: \u201cVarun\u201d; \u2014 New frontal wheel: \u201cSabbath\u201d (4 pcs.); \u2014 Unique character portrait: \u201cAlva\u201d; \u2014 Unique paint can; \u2014 1500 in-game coins.

The Arbiter\u2019s daughter has been drawn to the otherworldly since she was a child, but her father taught her only to drive and shoot, with the hope of making Alva his own bodyguard in the future. The Firestarters offered a compromise: they recognized the girl\u2019s potential and took her with them, continuing not only to nurture her cruelty but also providing her with occult knowledge. However, the shamans soon cast the young witch out for her different view of their ideology: while fire was the most important element for them, Alva drew her strength from death. She believed that by killing a man in a fair fight, one could take away the power of the defeated. For years Alva wandered through the woods, communicating with spirits and searching for her destiny, until eventually she stumbled upon an abandoned armoured car in a cave in the swamp. The young woman decided that the vehicle was inhabited by an ancient raven spirit named Kutkh, who needed to absorb souls in order to live. The witch was able to start the car and returned to her father, who immediately offered Alva to become his bodyguard. Such cooperation was beneficial for everyone: the attempts on Petrolium\u2019s life happened quite often, and Alva with her armoured vehicle were eager to kill. The unique armoured car presented in the pack is known for its balance of weapons, combination of modules and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the \u201cPacks\u201d tab, select the desired armoured car and click the \u201cAssemble\u201d button.

The legendary mercenary Wolfhound has stopped contacting his customers a long time ago. Of course, many thought that the Valley had ruined him, but in fact it was a man who tried to do so. Which is not surprising, considering how many enemies a hired killer can have. One night, when Wolfhound arrived at a routine meeting with his client, the mercenary was ambushed. The abandoned plant, where the meeting was supposed to take place, was turned into a pile of rubble and dust, but the vigilantes could not find Wolfhound\u2019s body in it. They couldn\u2019t find his car either. The mercenary\u2019s enemies celebrated their victory and went on with their lives, forgetting about Wolfhound like a bad dream. But a few years later, one of the vigilantes fell into a familiar snare, and seconds later all that was left of his armored car was a flaming pile of metal. One by one, those who had once tried to destroy the mercenary began to die under similar circumstances, and all of them met the same unfortunate end. Wolfhound has returned, but he stopped killing for money. Now all those who had once used his services started to die. The rumors about the emergence of a terrifying ghost named Barghest started to spread around the Valley. People just couldn\u2019t believe that the mercenary could have survived that attempt on his life, and decided that he had really become a ghost. A far more dangerous and terrifying ghost than Wolfhound himself had been. The unique armoured car presented in the pack is known for its balance of weapons, combination of modules and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the \u201cPacks\u201d tab, select the desired armoured car and click the \u201cAssemble\u201d button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases to 55. Attention! Storage overflow is possible under certain conditions. Buying the pack also gives early access to several structural parts. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy. Unique portraits provide an excellent opportunity to stand out among the survivors. Paint cans are a way to make your armored car different from the pack. Coins \u2014 is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention! When buying multiple packs, the acquired coins stack!","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2112/seAGJJ0JuFb978ziSiYuap7Z.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/EP4432-CUSA06859_00-EB00870000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Simulation, Unique","PlusPrice":199,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2112/seAGJJ0JuFb978ziSiYuap7Z.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Crossout \u2013 Barghest (English Ver.)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"Gaijin Distribution KFT","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-25","Slug":"crossout--barghest-english-ver-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":398,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":199,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-18","description":"Mediterranean Horror: Explore the forsaken capital of an awe-inspiring archipelago.

His new destructive capabilities makes the high-speed action more satisfying than ever! INTI CREATES is proud to present new apeX of cutting-edge 2D action with Luminous Avenger iX 2! ●2D action that breaks new ground! With his new spinning blade weapon, the Razor Wheel, Copen rips through any enemy standing in his way as he traverses an enormous tower. A wide variety of stages with powerful boss characters lurking in them await him. Copen earns a new EX Weapon for his arsenal whenever he defeats a boss. He uses these weapons to target enemies' weak points to bring them down faster; a key strategy to clearing stages and ascending the tower quickly. Copen's Bullit Dash that allows him to fly freely through the air has also been powered up! Super-stylish maneuvers reward those who master the Bullit Dash's high-speed capabilities! ●Tear through your enemies at break-neck speed! Copen takes on all challenges by changing seamlessly between his two forms: the power-focused \"Break-Shift\" and the speed-enhanced \"Bullit-Shift.\" Crush your enemies in Break-Shift to bank points and activate Overdrive! In Overdrive, Copen can stay in Bullit-Shift mode longer, allowing him to zip through the air at high speed. ●The \"Muse of Hope\" Lola is lovelier than ever! Her songs really light up the stage! When Copen's HP hits 0, Lola can transform and activate her Anthem skill to bring Copen back to life using the power of song. She brings that recovery power to the frontlines in Luminous Avenger iX 2 with her newest and cutest form yet: Healing Mode! This powerful new ability heals Copen to full HP at any time, anywhere, and as often as he likes...with no cost! Build up over 1000 Kudos points and Lola will really heat up the battle with her song! ●An intense standalone story! Luminous Avenger iX 2 is set in a parallel world where a dystopic story unfolds in a ruined desert wasteland where only robots exist.

Each floor presents a unique challenge to overcome through wits, strategy and positioning. Make clever use of attacks, movement, skills and hazards to clear floors of enemies and advance higher toward your destiny. In Evertried, the player\u2019s actions dictate when enemy units move. In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension! Test Your Strategic Might Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy. Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don\u2019t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level. Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top. Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might.

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You\u2019re the only human there, after all. SURVIVAL Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game \u2013 including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™\u2019s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/80159","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0114/xvUwYjctSRFXETMYPdfkwDUc.png?w=200","MainStory":23,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/HP0507-PPSA04872_00-8740332137435014","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9cj2mae5w","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":46,"genre":"Action, Strategy","PlusPrice":123.6,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0114/xvUwYjctSRFXETMYPdfkwDUc.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Riftbreaker (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"Marvelous Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-13","Slug":"the-riftbreaker-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":206,"MainExtra":35,"SalePrice":123.6,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"Additional content for \"LOST JUDGEMENT\".

As Redgi, heir to the Rat Throne, you must restore your broken Kingdom by banishing the merciless Frog Clan and their ferocious leader, Greenwart. As you explore the deceivingly charming world, you\u2019ll encounter a cast of unique companions, ready to aid you in your adventure. And you\u2019ll need all the help you can get, whether that\u2019s new meal recipes, blueprints to forge deadly weapons and armour, or even a land-chugging, armour-plated mole mobile! Overcome your fears. Rescue your brothers. Restore Your Kingdom. Your tail has begun\u2026 Master Brutal Combat From frog zombies to gargantuan grubs - and everything in-between - the Kingdom is awash with danger.

PLAYSTATION 5 ENHANCEMENTS Enjoy massively reduced loading times thanks to the SSD and experience an augmented level of immersion with the Dual Sense controller. Feel object resistance, surface texture, damage feedback, heartbeat simulation and more thanks to the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. SYSTEM REDUX Veteran Observers can dive deeper into this dystopian reality thanks to three brand-new side cases to solve. \u201cErrant Signal\u201d, \u201cHer Fearful Symmetry\u201d and \u201cIt Runs in the Family\u201d add another layer of depth to the game\u2019s story while exploring thought-provoking themes of a future that soon might become our present. On top of that, System Redux offers expanded gameplay, which includes new game mechanics, new secrets to find, redesigned stealth, additional neural interrogations, and quality-of-life improvements made with the help of the Observer community. Newcomers get the chance to experience one of the most thrilling cyberpunk stories in all its next-gen glory: boasting 4K resolution, upgraded textures, new animations, models and effects, and transformed with jaw-dropping Ray-Tracing and HDR lighting. WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects\u2019 minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion. But remember, no matter how deep you go, you can never hide from an Observer.","SaleStarted":"2022-12-22","LowestPrice":"/game/82626","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-hk/product/UP4176-PPSA02118_00-8840415776217330","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RseKlXtD8cE","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":13,"genre":"Horror","PlusPrice":0,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Observer: System Redux (Simplified Chinese, English, Korean, Japanese)","ESRBRating":"HKD","Publisher":"Bloober Team","ReleaseDate":"2021-07-22","Slug":"observer-system-redux-simplified-chinese-english-korean-japanese-playstation-hk","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":1,"Price":238,"MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":119,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-01-06","description":"A video game about secret lives, the ties that bind and how magic can be found in the mundane.

Away from home, Donna seeks teenage thrills with her friends Becky and Vivek, but gets more than she bargained for when the trio become unexpected kidnappers in a game of amateur detective gone wrong. - John, an overworked middle-aged single dad. Burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent, John jealously pines after the free and easy life of his twenty-something bachelor neighbour, Jack. When the pair unwittingly fall foul of a vengeful stranger, a cursed artefact threatens to transform their lives forever. - Meena, a ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work. As Meena vies with an upstart colleague for a crucial promotion, something ancient stirs in the basement beneath her workplace.

With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality. In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.

The CURTAIN CALL Chapter is a Chapter for Dead by Daylight and it includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map. People often speak of the tears of a clown, of the sadness that lies beneath the greasepaint smile. What if that wasn\u2019t sadness, but a deep malevolence, born of a life spent in the pursuit of drink and gluttony? A mind that sees others only as vessels for torture, and reduces their bodies down to a single finger, a trophy to be added to a collection? For something like that to survive, it would have to wear a disguise, cloak itself in a brighter aspect and a broad smile, even if it were just painted on. Kate Denson\u2019s smile is genuine, friendly and warm. She sings of love and life, family and hope. She holds those values dear, and will fight anyone who tries to destroy them.

Bayonetta includes an optional Japanese dub (originally made for the PS3 version), while Vanquish comes with 3 weapons that were previously PS3 exclusive DLC. ■Bayonetta - Climax Action With its brilliantly designed stages, filled with challenging enemies and traps, Bayonetta is like an action movie climax that never stops. Fight however you want, with a large variety of weapons and accessories that can be equipped to both your hands and feet. Experience a world where \"Witches\" fight \"Angels\"; where good and evil are reversed, now realized at an even greater level of graphical fidelity. ■Vanquish - Shooting Action Shoot, dodge, and use the boosters in your \"ARS\" Battle Suit to blaze your way around the battlefield! Featuring fast and frenetic gameplay, the experience of boosting up to enemies and blowing them away is something that only Vanquish can provide. Unlike regular stop and pop shooters, you'll need to take the initiative - keep moving and fighting if you want to survive. There's nothing else quite like it.

It\u2019s hosted by everyone\u2019s favorite curmudgeon Razmi with plenty of comic dialogue between her and Ajna. Razmi has decided to annoy Ajna by challenging her to do something impossible, promising a \u201creward.\u201d Ajna accepts the first challenge and after the player succeeds at it, Razmi claims it was part of 40 things you have to do, but Ajna remains optimistic and is willing to go through all of them. Razmi is discouraged by Ajna's continued success but is determined to make Ajna look foolish, so keeps coming up with new absurd challenges. As the player continues, other fan-favourite characters tell Razmi that it is getting to be too much, which Razmi stubbornly ignores. \u2022 Missions are gated by players\u2019 current story progress. These will be spread across the game for players starting from early on, with new sets of challenges unlocked at points in the story where they learn new abilities. \u2022 DLC will begin for players on a new save file once they have added Razmi to the party. DLC Overview: \u2022 40 self-contained challenge levels, each exploring mechanics from simple to advanced in a linear fashion. o World mechanic levels  Emphasizes combining learned moves such as Heruka Hustle (dash) into Pirate\u2019s Leap (high jump) in a series of challenges across a short linear level.  Each level assigns Ajna certain world traversal abilities and players must explore the imposed limitations. o Battle mechanic levels  Enemies with unique features that force the player to explore new ways to \u201csolve\u201d a battle  This will involve use of established battle mechanics, such as Iddhi meter building, Clean Blocking, and various \u201cbattle gimmicks\u201d like battle armor, physical attack resistance, and magic attack resistance. \u2022 Two new palettes. \u2022 New trophies and achievements. \u2022 A comic side-story with Ajna and Razmi as a framing device. \u2022 2-3 hours of content when played straight through (levels taking 3-5 minutes in one go) but the emphasis is on providing a challenge to the player so multiple re-tries should be expected. \u2022 Challenges will however start much easier and ramp up in difficulty as they are unlocked across the main game.

Set around a city being consumed from within by a disease, Plague Road tells a story of a lone doctor who once abandoned their home and now returns to learn the fate of those they left behind. Travel from the safe refuge of your farm through a series of regions progressively more affected by the infernal plague. On the road, rescue survivors and choose whether to use them as traveling companions or to improve the Doctor's farm and gain access to new abilities. How your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work. Some survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your ability to fight horrors created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring grid-based positioning and turn-based strategy mechanics.

Please apply the latest patch. Welcome to the 1940\u2019s. Europe is being torn apart by the war, the USA is preparing for battle and the mob does business as usual. Only this time they went too far, even for Vinnie\u2019s standards. Prepare yourself to go to war after you make a shocking discovery about what actually happened during the end-stage of the Thugtown Massacre from Guns, Gore & Cannoli 1. \"Just when you thought you were out, we\u2019re pulling you back in!\" STORY 1944, the war in Europe is entering its final stage. 15 years have passed since Vinnie survived the Thugtown Massacre. But now, some loose ends start crawling out of the past, dragging Vinnie as far as the European battlefield of World War 2. Find out who is chasing Vinnie around like a dog, turning all his friends into foes. KEY FEATURES Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 continues the rich, engaging gangster story of the first game and includes all the fast paced action you\u2019ve come to love, we made the best even better, with: Upgraded character mobility Vinnie has received a massive upgrade in his mobility features. 360 aiming, double jumping, kicking, jump-kicking, dodge rolls, somersaults, dual guns and a weapon wheel. Campaign mode Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 features a full single or multiplayer campaign mode, packed with action, humor and animated cutscenes. Rich environments We pushed our artists to the limits to produce the best immersive, atmospheric backgrounds, smoothest animations, and coolest special effects, setting a new benchmark for 2D games. Look for opportunities to bring down walls, explode barrels, drop crates on top of enemies, blow up cars and even kick your enemies through doors. Enjoy watching the corpses of your enemies fly through the air like ragdolls after you blast them away with your rocket launcher. Immersive world and period Walk around in the European battlefields of World War 2. Every level of Guns, Gore & Cannoli breathes the 1940\u2019s. Every inch of the game is like a picture straight from the second World War era. The cars, the furniture, the speakeasy clubs, the music, the propaganda posters, the streets and the weaponry reflect the turbulent time that the 1940\u2019s were. Online and local Co-op mode You don\u2019t want to die alone in the trenches? Well round up a platoon of 4 players and get blasting. Play as Vinnie in the solo campaign, or with up to 3 friends together while fighting through hordes of Nazis, zombies, monster, gangsters, cops, soldiers, tanks, submarines... in this all-new and incredibly fun arcade-style co-op action game. Teamwork is essential to surviving waves of enemy goons.

It was a large-scale RPG that the game company Enigma poured all of its energy into, but canceled development on after the disappearance of game director Shina Ninomiya. Several years later, \u201cWorld\u2019s Odyssey,\u201d which was supposed to have been deleted from the network, is restored in a state eroded with every possible \u201cbug.\u201d These bugs, which take on the form of actual insects, are infesting humans, objects, monsters, and every possible material, and collapsing the game world. Bugs have produced a number of mysterious phenomena, transforming the world into one filled with various mysteries and madness such as \u201cbugs with their own will,\u201d \u201cNPCs with human hearts,\u201d and \u201ccharacters who cannot exist.\u201d An e-mail arrived for game programmer Arata Mizunashi. The sender: Shina Ninomiya, a game director who went missing a year prior. She, together with Arata, once developed \u201cWorld\u2019s Odyssey,\u201d a game that fully implemented virtual reality, but after she disappeared, development on the game was canceled. The cryptic e-mail indicated that Shina Ninomiya disappeared in World\u2019s Odyssey, a game that does not exist. Arata tries to analyze the program, which should have been deleted from the network but was restored. The program has been rewritten to the point that it has no trace of its original form, and in a world full of bugs, Shina was there as the only \u201cplayer.\u201d Arata tries to get in touch with Shina and learns that she cannot log out from this game. And so the two look for clues, and alongside NPCs that possess human hearts and their colleagues, in reality, proceed with clearing the game from both the \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside.\u201d However, a dreadful situation also involving reality awaits.
