We have chosen the five most beloved logical games and bundled them together! You can play them either against the AI or against a friend (on the same console). Fill your coffee breaks with some brain stimulation! In this bundle you will find: TIC-TAC-TOE (also known as Noughts and Crosses, or Xs and Os) Two players alternate placing Xs and Os onto the grid. The first player to create a straight line of three of his or her symbols... wins! CHECKERS (also known as Draughts) Players move their pieces diagonally from one square to another square. When a player jumps over their opponent's piece, you take that piece from the board. The first player to lose all of his or her pieces loses the game. MEMORY GAME The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board covered with cards faced down with minimum number of moves. Each separate move is to turn over any two cards. If they match you take them from board, if not you turn them back over. MINES The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden \"mines\" without detonating any of them. Numbers on revealed squares show how many mines are adjacent to that square. GOMOKU Two players alternate placing white and black tokens onto the grid.

Dark Flavour The game is inspired by the Greek myth of the labyrinth and the fight between Theseus and the Minotaur. The dark theme is visually expressed by retro pixel art, enriched by voice acting and metaphorical storytelling, creating (we hope) a thrilling atmosphere. The Labyrinth The journey has 6 chapters - each with its own specific challenges, patterns, and rewards. A total of 42 stages, 5 skill upgrades - each with 3 levels, 3 hidden upgrades, 2 unique upgrades, secret passages and Easter eggs. Fair Warning This game is not a rogue-like dungeon crawler, but rather an experience which will ultimately give you the answer to the question: dare you know yourself? Of course, you can simply see it as a guilty pleasure arcade game, just take note: permadeath is unforgiving.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Tauronos_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tauronos-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"0","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k3ZCIRbdYM","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":"8","genre":"Adventure,Puzzle,Simulation,Arcade","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"5.40","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Tauronos.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"64.80","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"TAURONOS","ESRBRating":"Everyone 10+","Publisher":"Restless Corp","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-03","Slug":"tauronos-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"14.40","ChilePrice":"","Price":"6.99","MexicoPrice":"81.36","MainExtra":"0","SalePrice":"4.19"},{"CanadaPrice":"13.22","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-12","LowestPrice":"10.49","SaleStarted":"2022-04-21","description":"Retro-style platform game in keeping with the best traditions of games of our childhood!

The mythology-based hardcore action style transports the gamer into the realm of the game, and its namesake. Animus is very tactical in that it requires the learning and application of tactical skills to defeat enemies who would otherwise brutally punish any gamer expecting casual battles. Leveling, skill point placement, farming equipment and materials, as well as attack and defensive mechanics are crucial. Types and attributes of weapons, armor, and accessories are important. The Proficiency tree within the character status area should be utilized to advance further into the game. The amount of HP, amount of HP recovery, dodge time and distance, stamina control are some of the important stats to cover in that area. Players are rewarded for how they balance their equipment before a battle, and how they place skill points in their Proficiency tree. Preparedness will carry you far. The type and grade of drops get better upon progression and following playthroughs or at higher difficulty levels. Players will farm material and equipment. Much needed equipment drops (weapons, armor, accessories) occur in the sub-quests, which are indicated by blue flags. This is similar with the Rift (yellow flag) areas as well. However, Rift areas award players with Rift weapons, which are in most cases stronger weapons with dual attributes, comparable to other weapons of identical grades.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animus-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"4.5","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"65%","Completionist":"0","genre":"Action,Role-Playing,Arcade,Fighting","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"4.54","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_Animus.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"45.50","BrazilPrice":"","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"ANIMUS","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"TROOOZE","ReleaseDate":"2019-01-03","Slug":"animus-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"13.29","ChilePrice":"","Price":"7.99","MexicoPrice":"52.15","MainExtra":"5","SalePrice":"2.79"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.84","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-05-12","LowestPrice":"2.79","SaleStarted":"2022-04-21","description":"These are the days before Ire: Blood Memory, the days when Kerr the Breaker\u2019s evil slipped its way into Cadmeia.

Now it's on Rufus once again to convince all three parts of Goal, utilizing his remarkable charming wits, to become one again, venture to Elysium with her and save Deponia from certain doom while he's at it.

Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's novella At the Mountains of Madness, but largely set after the original story. You, as Frank Gilman, open your eyes inside a room filled with strange, pulsating noises. Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you\u2019re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near the South Pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister... Explore the Antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues and unlock secrets, whilst avoiding macabre beings at all cost. Key features: A deep and suspense-filled Lovecraftian story with lots of secrets and Easter eggs. Ominous but wonderful graphics created with Unreal Engine 4. Multiple endings. A haunting and atmospheric soundtrack.

A mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease. The hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. A mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself!

The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. Renovate and decorate train stations and trains. Detailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements. Build your own station. Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station. Choose how hard you want to work. The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage.","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TrainStationRenovation_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/train-station-renovation-switch/","platform":"Switch","MainStory":"8.5","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHoo9Hg5OZA","PeruPrice":"","PercentOff":"85%","Completionist":"17","genre":"Simulation,Adventure","ArgentinaPrice":"","AustraliaPrice":"2.85","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_TrainStationRenovation.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"","SouthafricaPrice":"34.20","BrazilPrice":"14.39","OpenCriticURL":"","RussiaPrice":"","Title":"Train Station Renovation","ESRBRating":"Teen","Publisher":"Forever Entertainment","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-06","Slug":"train-station-renovation-switch","NumberofPlayers":"1 player","PolandPrice":"6.99","ChilePrice":"","Price":"18.99","MexicoPrice":"58.49","MainExtra":"13.5","SalePrice":"2.84"},{"CanadaPrice":"15.74","SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-04-28","LowestPrice":"12.49","SaleStarted":"2022-04-14","description":"Lead the ultimate party of heroes into the Tower of Time, a vertical battleground filled with lore, mystery, and combat.

Sadja, a Southern princess, has an unstoppable desire to become the greatest hero in history \u2013 by joining and succeeding in the biggest war Aventuria has ever seen: The war of the Mages, fought in the middle of an uninhabitable desert. Bird catcher Geron lives almost 450 years after the Great War. Geron\u2019s eternal love, Nuri, has been turned into a crow by an evil curse. To give her back her human form, Geron needs the help of the mysterious merchant Fahi, who has magical powers. But Fahi is only willing to help Geron if he agrees to solve a puzzle which Fahi has seen in his dreams. The quest for answers soon leads to a chain of events that connects both Sadja's and Geron's stories, threatening to turn the present into a grim reflection of a long forgotten past.
