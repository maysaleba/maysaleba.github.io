87,2023-07-19,"PLAY FROSTPUNK: CONSOLE EDITION This version of the award-winning game from 11 bit studios is tailored to give console players the full Frostpunk experience: • Thanks to the special, dedicated controller scheme all important features of the game are quickly within your reach. • The Console Edition of the game already includes all the updates that have been released since its premiere on PC. THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Offering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. EXPAND AND EXPLORE Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.",2023-07-04,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4361-CUSA15690_00-FROSTPUNKGAME000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipHHGDDhm9Q,80%,,"Strategy, Simulation, Strategy",0,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307dRNIA91BmsNlAiza66g_qnqcnn5bL2DO8xTxiQLGTCkodnDdjk43lKvKFcfwVP58sneYw4cnkgSxjkX96GdoeACAEQa.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/frostpunk-console-edition,Frostpunk: Console Edition,TRD,11 Bit Studios S.A.,2019-10-10,frostpunk-console-edition-ps4-tr,https://shope.ee/6fDHRQpNgG,0,259,,51.8,1

80,2023-07-19,"IMPORTANT NOTE: The game focuses on exploration and builds tension slowly to create a deeper and more meaningful experience. Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. Visage is a first-person psychological horror game. Explore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience. Environment The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You’ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining. Storyline This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You’ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows? Dark entities The families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They’ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own. Gameplay In Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You’ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it. Dying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you'll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.",2023-07-04,/game/51108,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1322/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png?w=200,8,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3236-PPSA04698_00-5793122806301854,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-AJjWF58AY,50%,15,Horror,134,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1322/zz3hYWUBYCDYoe1bwz0sa3Qo.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/visage,VISAGE,TRD,SadSquare Studio Inc.,2021-11-10,visage-ps4&ps5-tr,https://shope.ee/1fobSYXdyC,1,335,11,167.5,1

77,2023-07-19,"Observer: System Redux is the definitive vision of the award-winning cyberpunk thriller, rebuilt and augmented for the next generation. PLAYSTATION 5 ENHANCEMENTS Enjoy massively reduced loading times thanks to the SSD and experience an augmented level of immersion with the Dual Sense controller. Feel object resistance, surface texture, damage feedback, heartbeat simulation and more thanks to the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. SYSTEM REDUX Veteran Observers can dive deeper into this dystopian reality thanks to three brand-new side cases to solve. “Errant Signal”, “Her Fearful Symmetry” and “It Runs in the Family” add another layer of depth to the game’s story while exploring thought-provoking themes of a future that soon might become our present. On top of that, System Redux offers expanded gameplay, which includes new game mechanics, new secrets to find, redesigned stealth, additional neural interrogations, and quality-of-life improvements made with the help of the Observer community. Newcomers get the chance to experience one of the most thrilling cyberpunk stories in all its next-gen glory: boasting 4K resolution, upgraded textures, new animations, models and effects, and transformed with jaw-dropping Ray-Tracing and HDR lighting. WELCOME TO THE FUTURE The year is 2084. The future has turned out much darker than anyone could imagine. First, there was the Nanophage. A digital plague that killed thousands upon thousands of those who chose to augment their minds and bodies. Then came the War, leaving both the West and the East decimated and shattered. With no one left to seize power, corporations took over and forged their own crooked empires. You are a tool of corporate oppression. Feared and despised, you hack into the darkest corners of your suspects’ minds. You creep into their dreams, expose their fears, and extract whatever your investigation may require. You are an Observer. BECOME A NEURAL DETECTIVE You play as Daniel Lazarski, an elite investigator of the future portrayed by late cyberpunk icon Rutger Hauer. As an Observer, you hack into the minds of suspects to extract clues and evidence. Anything they felt, thought, or remembered can and will be used to solve your case. EAT THEIR DREAMS Using a device known as the Dream Eater, hack into the minds of the dead and dying to relive their final moments, to explore their fears and obsessions. Delve into these twisted neural mazes and search for clues that will help you find the elusive killer. But beware: the deeper you go, the greater the risk of losing your own sanity. TAKE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF 2084 Enter a world ravaged by war and cyber-plague, where life is cheap and hope is scarce. Where most people will do anything to escape their grim existence. Virtual realities, mind-altering drugs, neural implants - pick your poison and drift away into a blissful oblivion. But remember, no matter how deep you go, you can never hide from an Observer.",2023-07-04,/game/82626,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png?w=200,7,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4176-PPSA02117_00-8201964206903574,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RseKlXtD8cE,50%,14,Horror,0,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/2214/ErqnwUhRIdUHcJifL4ownssD.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/observer-system-redux,Observer: System Redux,TRD,BLOOBER TEAM S.A.,2020-11-11,observer-system-redux-ps4&ps5-tr,https://shope.ee/5V1K2a7CEd,1,259,9,129.5,1

70,2023-07-19,"Shadow Warrior is bold reimagining of the cult classic FPS from developer Flying Wild Hog and Devolver Digital. Blending the viciously over-the-top gunplay of its predecessor with the elegant precision of the powerful katana, Shadow Warrior is an imaginative take on the classic arcade-style shooter. Shadow Warrior tells the offbeat tale of Zilla Enterprise’s corporate shogun Lo Wang as he is ordered to acquire a legendary blade of limitless power by his deceitful employer. Betrayed and left for dead, Lo Wang learns of the blade’s connection to ancient gods from another realm preparing to push our world to the brink of destruction. Now the reluctant hero must become legend through a masterful combination of gun, blade, magic and wit to uncover the truth behind the demonic invasion and banish evil back into the darkness. 1 player 8GB minimum save size DUALSHOCK®4 Vibration Function HD Video Output 720p,1080p Download of this product is subject to the PlayStation Network Terms of Service and our Software Usage Terms plus any specific additional conditions applying to this product.

An iron hand in a velvet glove, she intends to assert her power and respect the Masquerade, the vampiric law designed to ensure humans never learn of the existence of these creatures of the night. But nothing works as planned. With rumours of plots, murders and power struggles, you must work in the shadows to protect your Sect in a pulsating investigation that plunges Boston into chaos. PLAY AS 3 ORIGINAL VAMPIRES Play as 3 vampires who are over a hundred years old.

Each character has their own vampiric abilities and disciplines that you can upgrade individually to suit your preferred approach. Will you choose intimidation, seduction or stealth? It's your decision, as long as you can sate your Hunger for blood. GAMEPLAY WITH CONSEQUENCES With its unique gameplay, Swansong puts emphasis on the consequences of your actions in both the investigation and your social interactions with other characters. Analyse each situation carefully because your decisions can have huge consequences on your heroes' lives and the fate of the Boston Camarilla.",2023-07-04,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA07302_00-VTMS000000000000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7L7M0R8fzA,70%,,Role-Playing,999999,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/vampire-the-masquerade---swansong,Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong,TRD,NACON SA,2022-05-19,vampire-the-masquerade--swansong-ps5-tr,https://shope.ee/7pPEnNaIEf,1,599,,179.7,0

,2023-07-19,"In the Trailmakers: Airborne Expansion you will take to the skies in an epic campaign to save the peaceful Chirpos from the pesky Robot Pirate invasion. Campaign In this mission-based campaign you will navigate a brand new Trailmakers-world with deserts, mountains, and beautiful floating islands. The local Chirpo population will grant you increasingly challenging quests as you progress deeper into the dangerous Robot Pirate territory. As you complete their quests you will receive blocks, parts, engines, wings, thrusters and so much more — giving you all the tools you need to soar the skies majestically like an eagle. Friendly- and enemy NPCs The Chirpos are friendly, fuzzy and flightless birds. They hold up in villages scattered across the land — the lucky ones anyway. The less fortunates ones are held in Robot Pirate captivity and the Chirpo Mayor of each village will kindly ask that you bring them home safely. The Robot Pirates are evil, ruthless and quite agile dog fighters. They will defend their newly invaded territory with fighter planes, flak cannons, blimps, hot air balloons and ground speeders. They are a “shoot first, ask later” kind of people so we advise you to implement the same strategy. Sandbox map The new map is a big one — and it’s open for you to explore as you please. You choose your own path but beware: Some areas are more dangerous than others and it’s wise to make sure you are geared up properly before heading into certain areas. Cleared for take-off Without revealing too much we would rather let you see it for yourself.

Chisato Ryoko pressed her ear to the shrine bell to hear it sing of omens to come: plagues of beetles and frogs, crippling winters, a priest breaking their foot between cobbled stones. She clung to the bell the night the shrine burned, her family run off, the priests pushed from cliffs. But Ryoko remained. She alone witnessed the ronin who appeared and cut down each desecrator. The ronin pulled Ryoko from the temple bell, pressed her ear to a sword, and abandoned her. She could hear a melody in the blade—it sang louder than the bell. Ryoko cared for the shrine’s ruin, polishing the cinder ribs of torii gates, but the saber’s hum turned more brutal—hypnotic, even—until one day she left to silence whatever made it sing. Entranced, she endured three trials: She crossed a lake frozen with a thousand peering birds. A single glance would lock her soul inside their stilled wings. She navigated ravines of a thousand bones, crawling with a thirst for things beyond water. At last, that which made the blade sing appeared—a crane with a corruption of cicadas spooled from its infested, wounded lungs. The crane lanced her jaw with its bill and prayed. “Rejoice, for each new hole is one more place for light to shine through.” Ryoko broke the crane’s neck. The trees fell silent, and the trance ended. She ventured to the edge of the sea and listened to her blade once more.

Players can swap between control of both characters on the fly, each with entirely different skillsets. Proceed through the castle while confronting the demonic bosses that await deep within. Each boss yields new weapons to wield, allowing for more varied exploration and opening up new routes. ?Swap out on the fly as you traverse through the demonic castle! Take control of both the tag-team Kamizono siblings. Make the most of long-distance focused Shinobu and close-range brawler Maya Kamizono as you make your way through the castle. Each sibling has a range of unique sub-weapons, giving you a wealth of options to switch your strategy up whenever the time calls for it. Don’t hesitate to make use of them so long as you have Weapon Points in stock! In the event that one of the siblings falls in battle, they can be resuscitated freely with Sister Rescue—provided you can make it back to where they fell. ?Defeat bosses to obtain new sub-weapons, opening up a whole new layer of exploration! Defeating bosses will yield new sub-weapons, providing the siblings with exciting new abilities. These sub-weapons also open up new routes and means of exploration in the castles. ?Enjoy the story your way with Pure or Refined voice tracks!

A total of 3 different styles—Casual, Veteran and Legend—are available for selection, allowing players to adjust the difficulty to their needs. This can be changed at any time after beginning the game with no drawbacks. What's more, co-op with both Shinobu and Maya will be possible should two controllers be available.

You have to perform increasingly complex tasks in prison, balancing the administration's assessment and inmates' satisfaction. In the game, you play the role of a prison guard and it is only up to you whether you decide to obey the law or let this place and people corrupt you completely. After all, who said you had to be an exemplary ranger? Maybe you prefer to trade with prisoners, help them smuggle, and bet on the outcome of fights in prison instead? After all, everyone likes to have fun sometimes. Especially in a sad place like this, where you are also the boss. Or at least you think so. So how? Will you choose to follow the rules, intercept contraband, count prisoners, send them to work, take care of their basic needs and keep prison gangs under control? Will you go to the dark side? Whatever you decide, remember that your actions will affect both the facility itself and the inmates, and above all, the further course of your career. Unique features of the game: - try to balance between following the orders of your superiors and doing small favors for the inmates. In doing so, you will maintain a fragile balance between both and benefit from the gratitude of both parties, - become the exemplary prison guard in campaign mode. Receive new prisoners, search cells for contraband for confiscation, view surveillance footage, maintain peace and order, react to inmates' acts of disobedience, and complete many other tasks assigned by your superiors, - or ignore all rules in Free Play mode.

,2023-07-19,"This DLC contains one Legendary Hunter, two legendary weapons, and one Legendary tool: - Luz Mala (Hunter) - Del Ojo (Vetterli 71 Karabiner Deadeye) - Raíz Mala (Caldwell Conversion Chain Pistol) - Premio del Tonto (Choke Bomb). Riders and shepherds on the great rangelands of Patagonia know not to follow la Luz Mala, the bad lights, when they flicker in the night. The wise warn the curious against being lured by the dancing phosphoresce. But the foolhardy are tempted by stories that la Luz Mala lead to riches and treasures. When those that are want to stray do, the luckiest find old bones and broken pots under the lights. The rest find their graves. The bad lights are strongest on days where rainfall is a distant memory, when canteens swill with dregs, and the earth cracks and gasps. On such a day, years ago, a girl was sent for water. She ignored her elder's advice and strayed towards the lights. She walked until it fell dark, and then further until it became bright. Lost, she spent days on the plain, sucking the moisture out of roots, until a plume of smoke ushered her homewards. At the base of the plume, she only found a massacre. After she buried her family, she saw the lights again on the horizon and set off after them, her despair mingled with a newfound veneration. The ranchers who committed the massacre also knew the legends of la Luz Mala, but did not fear them. They believed them to be some kind of natural luminescence, nothing more. But as the years wore on, and their hair greyed, when they saw the lights, they became more and more uneasy, as if the lights were looking back at them. Once their uneasiness set in, it soon blossomed into outright terror. Whenever the lights appeared, one of their number would turn up dead. The ranchers began to believe the stories that they were the spirits of the unquiet dead. Some chased the lights, daring them to fight. Others fled, new lights blinking into their path from the depths of the darkened plain. The girl spent too long as the ghost in the glow.

,2023-07-19,"Use your grappling hook to swing around in giant levels, dash through energy crystals, find hidden secrets and master even the most difficult worlds. Play in free style or against the timer with one or two grappling guns and finish more than 10 enormous levels by dodging obstacles and deadly traps. It’s easy to play, it’s fast and it’s fun. You start the game in the middle of a giant city surrounded by skyscrapers. You look around and see a giant poster that explains the general movement. This way you learn that you are able to dash while being in the air. You also realize that you have a grappling gun in your hand and see floating crystals above your head. You aim at the crystals and use your grappling gun to hook onto them. Once hooked you start swinging and swing towards the next crystal. You hook on to the next crystal and have already mastered the main movement mechanism. After a couple of hooks, you realize that you can change your swinging direction and speed by dashing into the wanted direction. This is the second important thing to learn about the movement and gives you a lot of freedom in your movement. Soon you will reach the next giant poster which explains further movement patterns that you can use to improve your precision and movements. You learn that you can remove your grappling hook, use an in-air dash and then hook on to the next floating crystal to build up speed and energy. You can use this energy to collect hidden achievements, dash through activator crystals, that unlock new areas o the level, or speed run levels later on. Furthermore, you realize that the dash refreshes every couple of seconds which leads to an incredibly fast and satisfying movement once you are able to master it.",2023-07-04,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0616/xTpaVApaeqWLeKILuhVo3DMo.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6556-CUSA36652_00-7394737770687028,,40%,,"Action, Casual, Family",49.5,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0616/xTpaVApaeqWLeKILuhVo3DMo.png,,Grappling Dash,TRD,EpiXR Games UG,2022-12-20,grappling-dash-ps4-tr,,0,99,,59.4,1

,2023-07-19,"Escape String is a 2D puzzle game set in an undefined time and place. A small humanoid robot wakes up in the debris of a landfill inside a large factory. He receives strange and enigmatic messages, from someone who apparently wants to help him. The robot's purpose is to explore the large factory where he is in search of answers about who he and his mysterious remote helper are. The player does not control the robot directly and in real time, but inserts movement commands above its display in order to tell the robot when it is time to jump, to crouch and more. It is therefore a puzzle game based on perspective: the player must calculate the spaces between the robot and the obstacles. The obstacles are initially totally static, but as they advance they will be more and more dynamic and varied. For example, we will have guard robots that will perform the same actions as our robot in a mirrored manner. There are currently 40 levels, with 8 types of obstacles. The real challenge will consist in finishing the level with the minimum possible number of indications (input) and providing these commands in a single line (string), ending the level while simultaneously satisfying these conditions will unlock the gold chip of that particular level. The gold chip will be used to unlock new skins for our robot. This title is therefore suitable both for those looking for a relaxing puzzle, given the non-dynamic gameplay, and for those looking for a challenge given its arcade nature. - Original puzzle game - Suitable for all ages - Many types of obstacles - Relaxing but with a good level of challenge - 40 levels, expandable - Original art sector - Skins for the character - No microtransactions",2023-07-04,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0918/J74I6xtnTXOobXQ5SGU1zxnZ.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8151-CUSA37535_00-5946527224077423,,40%,,Puzzle,34.5,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/0918/J74I6xtnTXOobXQ5SGU1zxnZ.png,,Escape String,TRD,7 RAVEN STUDIOS CO.

For example, Elena's last mission was to safely recover stolen ancient relics. An unknown thief had ransacked the national museum and got away with the namesakes of the empire's oldest rulers. A team of detectives picked up a trail that led across the border, but then disappeared. The Queen summoned Elena. The items stolen are of paramount value to the empire and crown, she said in a slightly wavering voice. We mustn't lose them. I understand, your Majesty, Elena answered. But announcing their disappearance would only complicate the matter, so you must carry out your duty in the strictest secrecy! You shall at once be sent abroad under the guise of an ambassador to carry out your investigation in secret. You must track down the perpetrator and force them to return what was stolen. Elena soon found herself on a top-secret covert mission of vital interest to the Crown. Her first order of business upon arrival was notifying the local police of the missing valuables. Were the items stolen from your hotel or at the port? Asked the chief of police, his moustache twitching like a walrus'. Neither, Elena answered, they were stolen on the boat, but I know for certain the culprit is still here. Hm...very well, the officer let out with an air of authority. We'll get on the case at once, don't you worry. There isn't a criminal out there who can slip away from me... By evening, the list of suspects had been narrowed down to a few names. Elena asked the chief if she could accompany the detectives to identify the culprit, and he gave his permission. Elena was not only sharp as a tack, but was well-versed in the new deductive method, which had already helped her crack open five robbery cases, two murders and one case of destruction of hotel property. In the end, Elena and the detective team tracked down the artifact thief and were just waiting for the judge to sign the arrest warrant, when an urgent telegram came in from the Prime Minister with orders to meet that very night. She had no choice but to return home that very instant and put her operation on hold. What was it that happened in the palace that forced her to abandon her job and return immediately? Join Elena on an unforgettable adventure through an alternate Victorian world across the endless Emperor Desert Valley, the green banks of the Nile, a volcanic island and more!

Combine his powerful melee and ranged attacks to vanquish your enemies. Heal carefully so that foes don’t steal your remedy, use movement, various buffs, and debuffs to gain the advantage and defeat your rivals; Customizable hero: implant different organs into the body of your Herald to acquire unique combat enhancers and passive abilities. Gather and equip nodes and runes to make your Herald godlike. Express yourself, create a build that fits your playstyle perfectly, be it companions, throwable weapons, critical or DoT damage and much more; Crafting system: deep crafting systems that allow you to disassemble basic materials and create from received resources unique organs, weapons, gear and consumables that will help you to define your unique playthrough; Vast open world: explore distant lands beyond belief and meet their exotic inhabitants — merchants and bandits going about their lives regardless of where you go.

You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you.

There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots. IF IT WASN'T CAUGHT ON VIDEO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN Skating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip. CUSTOMISATION Show off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, Grind King, Thankyou and many others.

But in the coming years, their land grew ill, and soon they all followed. Siblings and cousins, aunts and uncles: Maeve helped her mother give them all back to the earth, burying them with their favorite possessions in hand. When Maeve buried her mother, there were no treasures left to harvest, so she placed dried seeds on her cold fingers and prayed they brought her mother bounty in a world beyond. Harvest season came again, and from the decaying flesh of her kin, the crops grew fuller and richer than ever before. A ravenous Maeve fed and gorged, and when her gaunt body could take no more, she shared it with the birds, the rabbits, and the deer. Maeve kept to herself, and it would be many years before she met another person. When she did, they were people no longer. Disgusted by the greed of the rotting who refused to give back what was no longer theirs, she turned her tools into weapons and left her home behind.

Additionally, the player receives: — Access to new structural parts; — Maximum number of parts increased to 55. The Arbiter’s daughter has been drawn to the otherworldly since she was a child, but her father taught her only to drive and shoot, with the hope of making Alva his own bodyguard in the future. The Firestarters offered a compromise: they recognized the girl’s potential and took her with them, continuing not only to nurture her cruelty but also providing her with occult knowledge. However, the shamans soon cast the young witch out for her different view of their ideology: while fire was the most important element for them, Alva drew her strength from death. She believed that by killing a man in a fair fight, one could take away the power of the defeated. For years Alva wandered through the woods, communicating with spirits and searching for her destiny, until eventually she stumbled upon an abandoned armoured car in a cave in the swamp. The young woman decided that the vehicle was inhabited by an ancient raven spirit named Kutkh, who needed to absorb souls in order to live. The witch was able to start the car and returned to her father, who immediately offered Alva to become his bodyguard. Such cooperation was beneficial for everyone: the attempts on Petrolium’s life happened quite often, and Alva with her armoured vehicle were eager to kill. The unique armoured car presented in the pack is known for its balance of weapons, combination of modules and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the “Packs” tab, select the desired armoured car and click the “Assemble” button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases to 55. Attention! Storage overflow is possible under certain conditions. Buying the pack also gives early access to several structural parts. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy. Unique portraits provide an excellent opportunity to stand out among the survivors. Paint cans are a way to make your armored car different from the pack. Coins — is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention!

,2023-07-19,"Play as 3 vampires, wield their powers wisely, and strike the right balance between your human and animal side in a heart-pounding story in which your choices will decide the fate of Boston. Based on the cult role-playing game and developed by specialists in the genre, Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong is a narrative RPG in which your every choice determines the fate of the three main characters and of the Boston Camarilla. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF DARKNESS What if vampires were real? What if these bloodthirsty predators lived hidden among us in complex societies and had been hatching conspiracies for thousands of years? And what if you became one of them? In Vampire: The Masquerade, you play as these alluring monsters in a sophisticated world where the lines between the real and supernatural are always blurred. A HEART-POUNDING THRILLER Hazel Iversen, the Swan, is the new Prince of the Boston Camarilla. An iron hand in a velvet glove, she intends to assert her power and respect the Masquerade, the vampiric law designed to ensure humans never learn of the existence of these creatures of the night. But nothing works as planned. With rumours of plots, murders and power struggles, you must work in the shadows to protect your Sect in a pulsating investigation that plunges Boston into chaos. PLAY AS 3 ORIGINAL VAMPIRES Play as 3 vampires who are over a hundred years old. Progress in the game through their intertwined destinies, deal with their different points of view and use their character sheets to try to separate the truth from the lies. Each character has their own vampiric abilities and disciplines that you can upgrade individually to suit your preferred approach. Will you choose intimidation, seduction or stealth? It's your decision, as long as you can sate your Hunger for blood. GAMEPLAY WITH CONSEQUENCES With its unique gameplay, Swansong puts emphasis on the consequences of your actions in both the investigation and your social interactions with other characters. Analyse each situation carefully because your decisions can have huge consequences on your heroes' lives and the fate of the Boston Camarilla.",2023-07-04,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-CUSA33241_00-VTMS000000000000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7L7M0R8fzA,70%,,Role-Playing,999999,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/0217/71QYUM7oGW12BWjFE75v7Rly.png,,Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong,TRD,NACON SA,2022-05-19,vampire-the-masquerade--swansong-ps4-tr,,0,599,,179.7,1

Son to revered wolf hunters in Kansas, he watched his mother and father stalk, hunt, and gut the beasts in front of his infant eyes. With each prey brought to the slaughterhouse they called home, the red haze grew and clouded his mind with sanguine dreams. When he held his first small game in crimson hands under the silvery light of the full moon, wolves howled as if to celebrate his rite of passage, unaware of the unholy bloodthirst burning in his heart, and ignorant of the bloodshed he’d bring upon them. It was the wolves – not his father – who taught Frisk how to hunt. Envious of their savage nature and hunting prowess, Frisk wanted to prove his worth by taking down the alpha wolf with the Caldwell Pax his father gave him. Successful, he adorned himself with the alpha’s skin, and his Caldwell with the fang ripped bloody from its maw and tried to stab his own father in the heart. He would become the mightiest predator in his territory. But in spite of besting the forest’s alpha, he could not best his father, and so Frisk disappeared in the night, taking only his father’s Caldwell and a Hunting Bow. His bloodlust led him to Louisiana, where he continued hunting, ignorant of the shadows tracking his every move; shadows Hunters in the Bayou would later come to know as Dire Wolf and Luna Wolf; shadows he had once called mother and father. Like a lone wolf, he listened to his instincts and left one pack for another, forgetting his human nature and his father’s words: “A wolf that leaves its pack becomes a threat.",2023-07-04,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202204/1209/ZaHmeN2hngFSUmz5WITwF8m3.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4291-CUSA15859_00-THEHUNTGAME00040,,40%,,"Shooter, Action, Shooter",59.4,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202204/1209/ZaHmeN2hngFSUmz5WITwF8m3.png,,Hunt: Showdown - Lonely Howl,TRD,Crytek Gmbh,2022-04-28,hunt-showdown--lonely-howl-ps5-tr,,1,99,,59.4,0

The legendary mercenary Wolfhound has stopped contacting his customers a long time ago. Of course, many thought that the Valley had ruined him, but in fact it was a man who tried to do so. Which is not surprising, considering how many enemies a hired killer can have. One night, when Wolfhound arrived at a routine meeting with his client, the mercenary was ambushed. The abandoned plant, where the meeting was supposed to take place, was turned into a pile of rubble and dust, but the vigilantes could not find Wolfhound’s body in it. They couldn’t find his car either. The mercenary’s enemies celebrated their victory and went on with their lives, forgetting about Wolfhound like a bad dream. But a few years later, one of the vigilantes fell into a familiar snare, and seconds later all that was left of his armored car was a flaming pile of metal. One by one, those who had once tried to destroy the mercenary began to die under similar circumstances, and all of them met the same unfortunate end. Wolfhound has returned, but he stopped killing for money. Now all those who had once used his services started to die. The rumors about the emergence of a terrifying ghost named Barghest started to spread around the Valley. People just couldn’t believe that the mercenary could have survived that attempt on his life, and decided that he had really become a ghost. A far more dangerous and terrifying ghost than Wolfhound himself had been.

The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. DAY’S FOR THE LIVING, NIGHT’S FOR THE DEAD Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO SURVIVE Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. GET BRUTAL AND BE CREATIVE ABOUT IT In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. FOUR PILGRIMS ARE BETTER THAN ONE Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.",2023-07-04,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/2908/6530QvCnHraJkqTUOWRXBdmx.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2911-PPSA02262_00-DELUXEEDITION0EU,,45%,,Unique,312.95,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202106/2908/6530QvCnHraJkqTUOWRXBdmx.png,,Dying Light 2 Stay Human – Deluxe Edition PS5,TRD,TECHLAND SP.

A DREAM GARAGE Your adventure starts by choosing your dream bike.

As he overcomes his challenges, he gains self-confidence, becomes more cunning and, along with it, finds more schemes to get past his foes. His epic journey will lead him through a remote monastery, a harsh and unforgiving stretch of desert, and a frontier town rife with crime and villainy.

However, the place doesn’t feel right and he plans his escape. “El Hijo - A Wild West Tale” is a non-violent stealth game in which you rely on the mischievous, playfulness of a young child.

Best way to describe this game by phrase: «fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzles». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher. We hope that players who are addicted to adventure games will fall in love with this small but very entertaining game.",2023-07-04,/game/98018,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/0517/xwozsdQiItXnb99GL6CpCKpO.png?w=200,0,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6536-CUSA26243_00-7236267619012493,,50%,3,Adventure,19.6,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/0517/xwozsdQiItXnb99GL6CpCKpO.png,,Glittering Sword,TRD,CHILIDOG INTERACTIVE LLC,2021-02-04,glittering-sword-ps4-tr,,0,49,0,24.5,1

In Radio Commander situation reports are given to you in form of dramatic radio statements sent by troops fighting on the ground. And your only accessory is a strategic map, on which you can place tokens and notes. Radio Commander offers an unique experience very different from classic real time strategy games. It’s a bold try to redefine the genre, as the player will be involved in a decision making process much more realistic than those pictured by casual RTS titles. Ask for situation reports. Listen what your men have to tell you. Send evac choppers and nape drops. Defeat the invisible enemy. Decide the fate of your soldiers. The choices you face will have a direct impact on the course of the game. They will also define views of your hero. Or maybe those are your views? Playing Radio Commander you must be prepared to answer tough questions about the righteousness of your actions, the price of a human life, and the toxic power of propaganda and stereotypes. Radio Commander includes: - 9 main campaign missions (every mission is possible to complete in several different ways), - 9 animated briefings, - 15 unit types, including: infantry, evac choppers, gunships, field artillery, aerial reconnaissance, M113 armored personnel carriers, and napalm-carrying F4 Phantom jets (every unit is described by a unique set of statistics and communicates with commander using a different voice), - full voice over, - over 200 dialogue blocks, used to construct radio messages, - over 600 story dialogues between units and the commander.",2023-07-04,/game/69329,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/1316/HwMgbPfNaI80QZxVvJvZamEw.png?w=200,8,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP1549-CUSA25956_00-CLABS0RCM2020102,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xubccklbVwo,38%,0,"Strategy, Simulator",77.48,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202101/1316/HwMgbPfNaI80QZxVvJvZamEw.png,,Radio Commander,TRD,PlayWay plc,2021-01-25,radio-commander-ps4-tr,,0,149,8,92.38,1

,2023-07-19,"A mature take on Cinderella that's all about player choices and shaping the famous fairy tale in any way you like. Cinders is a witty young woman living with an overbearing stepmother and her two daughters, as if she was reenacting a certain well-known fairy tale. But unlike its protagonist, Cinders is not afraid of taking fate into her own hands. Even if it means breaking the rules... The game takes a look at four women and what made them who they are. It’s a story about freedom, dreams, sisterhood, and finding your own Happily Ever After that may not exactly agree with the stale morals of classic fairytales. With multiple endings, 120 decision points, and over 300 choices, Cinders gives you total control over the main character’s personality and how her story unfolds.

Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage... Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight.

More dangerous than Lula are her traps – deadly and brutal killing contraptions with Max’s name written all over them. SHE WANTS ME DEAD is a side-scrolling platform game, released along megastars CAZZETTE’s new hit single with the same name. Your job is to help poor Max, whose only hope is to get through Lula’s deadly gauntlets in one piece. This might sound easy, if it weren’t for the fact that Lula really, really wants Max dead. But there is help. CAZZETTE’S NEW HIT SONG plays a major role in the game. Lula’s traps and other things in the environment move in rhythm with the music.
