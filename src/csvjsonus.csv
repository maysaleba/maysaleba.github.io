THE STORY Follow the story of Theoderich von Akenburg, a former crusader knight who, after becoming disillusioned with the cruelty of war, is called back into action by events set into motion 15 years ago when he and his former brother-in-arms, Ulrich von Grevel, stumble upon a fractured piece of an ancient artifact - the Rod of Aaron. A young monk named Malcom appears at Theoderich’s doorstep, bringing him news that the Rod contains power never meant for mortals, and Ulrich has become obsessed with finding the remaining pieces and unifying the rod, an event that could bring untold evil and suffering to the world. Theoderich takes on the quest of locating the remaining relics to keep them from Ulrich and begins a journey that will lead him across Europe and the Middle East. Throughout his journey, he’ll meet many other warriors that decide to rally to the cause, from the old, seasoned Reinhard von Kempten of the Teutonic Order to the ambitious young mercenary Grimhild Eidottr and her Raven Company, each joining for different reasons, but slowly forming bonds that will keep through the trials and tribulations to come. • Squad-based RTS with a range of units, from tanky swordsman to quick cavalry • Select hero-squads and auxiliary squads across 15 exciting, hand-crafted Single Player missions, each with custom cinematics, narrated journals, difficulty levels, and more • 5+ Hero Squads each with 3 different skill trees providing players with unique passive and active skills to choose from while leveling up their heroes • Large array of weapons and armors to loot and equip throughout the campaign, each with their own stats and special skill options • Combine hero skills and weapons/equipment for a huge selection of hero builds • Play cooperative with friends in the 3-player “Last Man Standing” mode, where you face hordes of enemies and earn experience to level up your knights and unlock new skills and cosmetics • Play competitively in multiple pvp game modes that support 1v1 and 2v2, with cosmetic meta-progression and special rewards for ranked play",2023-12-22,/game/107892,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0922/4909487a3425070f0a56c3e1ab6a7ae4ac99d9e1ac853c08.png?w=200,0,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4389-PPSA08512_00-RITTERTHEVALIANT,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL6PslPSMXg,30%,0,Strategy,17.49,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0922/4909487a3425070f0a56c3e1ab6a7ae4ac99d9e1ac853c08.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-valiant/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5,The Valiant,USD,THQ Nordic,2023-07-11,the-valiant-ps5-us,https://shope.ee/5piTy4iQGU,1,24.99,0,17.49,0

90,2024-01-06,"Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like, but with persistent upgrades, and persistent heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your inheritance, grow the family manor, and give your children a better fighting chance. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. One daughter could be vampiric Ranger, while another could be a vegan Chef. It’s a new experience every time. RL2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges. WHAT’S NEW IN 2 Every Adventure is Unique New monsters, traps, and layouts await you every time you enter the Kingdom. This is a world where improvisation, not memorization, is the key to success. Wildly New Classes No two classes play the same. Hide atop Ivy Canopies as the Ranger and rain poisoned arrows down on your foes. Take to the skies as a Dragon Lancer, striking enemies at massive speeds. Or sing and dance through danger as the joyous Bard. RL2 supports 15 new classes, with 15 distinct styles of play. Brand New Style Rogue Legacy 2 features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops. The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar Rogue Legacy look and feel. Revamped Biome Generation Biome generation in RL2 will feel completely new, as each biome adopts different “build strategies” to create completely unique randomly-generated regions. True Metroidvania To really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities and fundamentally change the way you play. Prove your worth, provided you can uncover the many heirlooms. Traits 2.0 Though fun the first time, traits in RL1 often wore their welcome later in the game. We’ve now added gold modifiers to entice players to take on new challenges. The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward. This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time. Relics and Resolve One of the most exciting new features to Rogue Legacy 2 is the ability to pick up Relics, which are unique items that change how your run is played. Gain stat modifiers, complete special challenges, and even gain brand new abilities as you traverse the kingdom. But be careful, the more Relics you obtain the more your resolve is shaken, and all Relics are lost if your hero perishes. Improved Accessibility Rogue Legacy 2 takes accessibility to the next level with the introduction of House Rules. Toggle contact damage, tweak global damage and health, and even give yourself flight for difficult platform sections. You have complete control over how you want to play the game. Also introduced are new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed. Rich Narrative & New Game+ Beating the game once is only the beginning. Learn about the inevitable collapse of a once-thriving kingdom, and discover the dark secrets of the ones responsible, while you connect and build relationships with the characters you meet along the way. The new and expanded lore to RL2 runs deep as you continue to explore and discover multiple playthroughs in NG+. Choose how the game gets harder, from unique biome hazards, to special boss fights. The experience keeps changing for near infinite replayability. More of Everything The sequel adds more of everything people loved from the original Rogue Legacy. More traits, spells, classes, biomes, enemies, equipment, rooms, story. More secrets... Just more everything.",2023-12-22,/game/80560,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2315/370f9bc417f347c5e73fbdda450758ea4b04022d234b0e28.png?w=200,26,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4488-PPSA15173_00-0338975894246736,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yi1pXd9AyY,35%,120,"Action, Adventure, Role Playing Games",0,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2315/370f9bc417f347c5e73fbdda450758ea4b04022d234b0e28.png,https://www.metacritic.com/game/rogue-legacy-2/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5,Rogue Legacy 2,USD,Cellar Door Games,2023-06-20,rogue-legacy-2-ps4&ps5-us,https://shope.ee/1fsv0noS7X,1,24.99,41,16.24,1

The more you discover, the more you will be confronted with questions about the nature of the cosmos and the purpose of civilization.

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.

Play as the #2 best investigator as you find clues, question silly suspects, and look at things through your magnifying glass. Some nay-sayers have called the magnifying glass useless, but what do they know? In Case 1, The Haunted Island, a sloth has been haunted for weeks by a mysterious ghost that nobody can seem to track down. Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective. In the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbor has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbor is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer. In the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all...

Radio stations can't broadcast through the static. In the small coastal town of Camena, unnaturally occurring electromagnetic waves are suddenly causing interference with electrical and radio equipment. Reluctantly, Riley Poverly returns to her hometown to investigate the mystery, but what she finds is more than she bargained for. OXENFREE II: Lost Signals is the mind-bending follow-up to the critically-acclaimed narrative adventure game OXENFREE from Night School Studio. Play it as a standalone story or dive deeper by playing the original – it's up to you. As you play, you'll shape every step of the story through your choices. How you choose to deal with the supernatural events at hand will forever alter the future. Your choices matter. Shape everything through your conversations and dialogue choices. Forge a deep friendship with an old acquaintance from high school or opt to ignore a lost fisherman in need. Your choices impact who Riley becomes, your relationships, and the story options available to you at every turn. Start chatter from anywhere. Use an all-new walkie talkie conversation system to chat with contacts and uncover useful insights about the mysteries of Camena. Ask for info, check in with the locals, or completely ignore them. It's your call to make. And, it has consequences. Stop Parentage. Five years ago on nearby Edwards Island, a few teenagers unwittingly opened a portal, creating a rift between realities and timelines. Now, members of a mysterious cult-like group called Parentage are deliberately trying to open a new portal to pull something out. Who are they? What do they want? Are they trying to contact ghosts? Tune in to the radio. Ghostly signals are piercing through the frequencies of Camena. Tap into the eerie sounds and static using OXENFREE's signature radio mechanic. You’ll communicate with the supernatural, manipulate the world, and travel to the past by tuning into time tears: unnatural fissures in the time-space continuum. Save everyone and everything. Your future was on the line in OXENFREE and those stakes are even higher in OXENFREE II. Explore, climb, and rappel across Camena’s beautifully treacherous landscape. Take risks and see where it takes you. It might be dangerous. But it could also save the future. Not only for Riley but for everyone.

Roam this intriguing land and discover its paths, inhabitants and ancient secrets. CRUSH YOUR OPPONENTS Your fists and speed are your greatest weapons.

74,2024-01-06,"Gord is a dark-fantasy, adventure-strategy game set in a hostile, forsaken land inspired by Slavic mythology. Besieged by vile creatures, you must build to survive. But to prevail, you must conquer the darkness beyond the gates. On the orders of the King, you are charged with striking out to make your mark on an untamed world—building and growing settlements in the face of resistance from raiders, monsters and more. Take command of the Tribe of the Dawn and embrace the ethical complexity of leadership as you shepherd the community — their safety and sanity are your responsibility. Protect them from hunger, disease and trauma. Nurture their faith and train them for battle. In return, they will pledge their loyalty and lay down their lives. In a land that lusts for blood, every family will learn sacrifice. While the gord offers respite, the darkness does not rest. You must prepare your party, find the courage to explore these forsaken lands, lead the conquest, and carve a path that will shape the kingdom.

73,2024-01-06,"ENDLESS™ Dungeon is a unique blend of roguelite, tactical action, and tower defense set in the award-winning ENDLESS™ Universe. Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her unusual incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESS™ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again.

Excavate the bedrock, reap the rewards of Mother Earth, and trade the mined valuables for new gadgets, travels, funky wild fashion, and more. Cave Digger 2 is a 1-4-player action-adventure game set in wildland valleys, where you discover old mines, nautical caves, and ruins of ancient civilizations inspired by Western, Dieselpunk and Lovecraftian themes. Explore the pristine lands, loot its riches, and unravel the mystery linked to a great explorer. As you go, it's best to keep a six-shooter nearby just in case. Tools and Progression Get thrown right away into the deep end by being stuck in the mines as your drill machine broke. With a single pickaxe, work your way to the surface camp where your journey can begin in earnest. Your goal is simply to mine and carry loot back to the surface the best you can for your mission assigners. With the surplus reward that you get, you can buy new things like upgrading your dependable pickaxe with a shinier look! (And faster digging rate.) Or buy dynamites that work on pretty much anything that needs to be worked on. Maybe you fancy a shovel that works for both digging and moving through the caves like a spider-miner. Whatever your preferred loadout, you will be ready to go deeper into the ever-shifting caves than any miner before or after you! Story The valleys have their mysteries and they hide them well. Step by step the player follows the same path where a great explorer has once wandered. Who is this hardy explorer? Why did he come to these valleys? And where is he now? The answers to these and more lie in the depths of the valleys. The story has multiple endings, each revealing a different side of it. Find the scattered comic pages to a tale of greed, eldritch power, and secrets beyond space and time. Who the wanderer is and why he did what he did in the valleys become clear in the end, but is it really the end? Co-op Multiplayer Gather a party of up to 4 players. Your role in the mining team is totally up to you! As long as at least somebody is carrying their weight in gold back to the surface, you all get paid in official Merchant Dollars equally. Co-op crossplay supports public matchmaking and private groups, and you are very free to show your wildlands drip by combining things from a generous selection of clothes, hats and faces once you've bought them first. So, take a pickaxe (and your friends) with you and head to the wildlands for the riches it holds, find out the secrets it contains, and dig deeper into the valleys than any adventurer before or after you!

Your adventure begins on a distant island, deep in a tropical Archipelago. What was once a prosperous tourist destination is now a shade of its former glory: and it’s your job to bring it back to life! Explore the Archipelago, meet the locals, and lend them a hand to restore the tourist paradise… while you try to uncover the mysteries of your past! SETTLING IN A NEW PLACE Your tropical life will be a busy one, so grab your tools and let’s get started! First things first: you’ll need a source of food, a place to spend the night in, and some resources to build a farm and kickstart your tropical journey. So what are you waiting for — time to explore your lands! A PLETHORA OF ACTIVITIES There’s plenty to do in Spirit of the Island! No matter how you choose to spend your time, you will gain experience and improve your skills, unlock new recipes, and become more efficient at everything you do, which will make your new life easier.

YOUR JOURNEY TO A TOURIST PARADISE Make your island not only a welcoming home but also a booming tourist paradise, with fancy shops and landmarks. The more tourists you get, the better your economy will be, which is a crucial step to fund your journeys to the faraway Islands. But how do you please them all, and what do you sell in your stores? That’s where your skills will come in handy! Sell local produce; open museums to display the treasure and secrets you uncover on your adventures. We bet some of your visitors could even buy a couple of quality wooden planks, so do your best to improvise! THE BEST TRIP EVER Each tourist will have a chance to love your Island so much that they’ll decide to stay, adding to the Town’s population. This part is crucial since you can hire them to do various things for you, such as tending to your shops and helping you maintain the Island. So do your best to make their trip a fantastic one! THE POWER OF TWO One of the main features of Spirit of the Island is a 2-player cooperative mode, where you can do… everything together!

Doing so will net you neat rewards and help you proceed towards your final goal: revealing the secret of your past. THE LOCAL COMMUNITY The Archipelago is bustling with life! Meet more than 14 unique characters, each with its own distinct traits and quirks. And yes, there are romance options as well! Depending on your character, you’ll be able to romance and marry different NPCs and hold a grandiose wedding in the end! AN EVENTFUL LIFE One of the unique features of Spirit of the Island is events — a series of recurring occurrences happening through each in-game year (4 months).

,2024-01-06,"Long Gone Days is an RPG set in the real world about human connection during war, focusing on civilians, language barriers, and borders. Follow Rourke, young man trained from birth to be a sniper for The Core— a subterranean paramilitary state. On his first mission, he is sent to the surface under orders of great significance. Motivated to finally be able to show the fruits of his training, he carries out his first orders to perfection only to find out that The Core was far from being the noble organization he thought he knew. A Nuanced Look at War: Experience the clash of modern conflict against civilian life through the contrast of intense RPG combat and slower, slice-of-life gameplay. Communication is Key: As Long Gone Days is set in the real world, you'll encounter several language barriers. Recruit interpreters in order to communicate with others and forge bonds beyond borders. Keep Morale High: Choose dialogue options wisely to boost morale in battle. Every character has distinct personality traits and motivations. Sniper Mode: Long Gone Days has two battle systems.

We choose to play as either Matthew Kolth, an occult obsessed paranormal investigator, into nightmarish scenes to fight perturbing monsters from ghastly realms, or as Della Hartfort, as she slithers her way stealthy to avoid the same monsters Matthew is emptying his bullets upon. Join either Mr. Kolth or Mrs.Hartfort as they both try to make sense of a hellish adventure that leads them into the depths of their own psyche and back again. Live through their difference of reality-gaze which merges fiction and ethereal dream sequences and go on to fight against evil in this dimension…and the next. Matthew Kolth is a paranormal investigator at the turn of the century that takes on a new case at Hartford Mansion.

Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That’s what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience without equal. Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement. The Tightest Crew The legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. Ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, one born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake. In order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan. Give in to your greed Give outlet to your greed and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash and jewelry and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics and accolades. It won’t be as simple as showing up and gaining goodies. You’ll have to work hard and plan smart to get away with as much loot as possible. Gain experience, unlock new skills and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges. The Art of Heisting A professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays. Thrive in Co-op Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends in mind, whether you bring them from your childhood or make them along the road.

,2024-01-06,"The apocalypse wasn’t the end of the world. Just the one we knew. Enter the Days of Doom, a post-apocalyptic tactical RPG roguelite that challenges players to reach Sanctuary, a place of promise and respite in a world of colorful chaos. Starting with a small cast of survivors, you’ll chart a path to reach your ultimate destination, encountering threats, including zombies, raiders, and even zombie raiders! Along the way you will need to recruit a ragtag band of heroes to protect your growing community and fight your way forward. Discovering how to best utilize each hero's unique abilities is the key to success in Days of Doom’s turn-based combat. Attack with Pyro early in the battle, as he ignites enemies for lasting damage. Then combine the Hydromancer and the Thrasher in a one-two knockout punch. Hydromancer can set the stage with a ranged water attack, and then the Thrasher can deliver a shocking surprise to wet enemies. The odds against you may seem insurmountable, but if you use your heroes' abilities strategically, upgrade them, and add new abilities along the way, you might just make it. No two runs are ever the same, which keeps you at the top of your game, and makes Days of Doom inherently replayable. Features Beautifully animated hand-drawn art that brings the quirky vision of the post apocalypse to life Eight character classes, each equipped with unique default and special abilities A dozen enemies from the archetypal zombie, to deadly raiders, to explosive monstrosities and two surprisingly brutal boss fights Over 50 randomly occurring events that present risk-reward scenarios Over 70 items and runes to collect to turn the odds in your favor Roguelite progression means no two runs will be the same, but you permanently upgrade stats like party size and speed of resource accumulation, which means each run will get you closer to reaching your goal Original orchestral soundtrack by Jelle Dittmar",2023-12-22,/game/129709,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2215/a2c4ed39850edea9177c0e5777ab08a3396c09c8664aae34.png?w=200,0,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0182-CUSA42287_00-0074731745058375,,20%,0,"Strategy, Strategy",20.99,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/2215/a2c4ed39850edea9177c0e5777ab08a3396c09c8664aae34.png,,Days of Doom,USD,Atari Inc.,2023-09-21,days-of-doom-ps4-us,,0,29.99,0,23.99,1

Help save the beautiful, ecologically sustainable world of Funtasia and its furry inhabitants from certain death beneath tons of garbage dumped on it from space by defeating the garbage monster at the end of the track. Simple to pick up and play, yet challenging to truly master, Funtasia is all about timing and balance. The race track ripples, with hills, pits, bridges, quicksand, cliffs, and caves separating you from the finish line.

Tackle challenging encounters with your party of two characters, using a variety of skills and highly interactive environments. Maybe you'll light an enemy on fire and kick them into a grain field for a proper barbeque, or set up a trap and fell a tree on top of them. The options are endless, and you're the one in charge! You have control over time The core of Iron Danger is its unique time control mechanic. You can rewind time up to 5 seconds whenever you want, trying different strategies and combinations of moves until you find the right one for the task at hand. The time manipulation allows us to combine real-time combat gameplay with controls from more traditional, tactical turn-based combat games. This gives tactical combat a puzzle-like element, as you can keep trying new approaches to turn impossible odds to your advantage and synchronize the actions of your characters for the perfect outcome. You will die, but you will not fail! Iron Danger is set in a world of lofty fells, primeval forest, and placid lakes...as well as living gods and monsters of steel. The city of Kalevala, home of the humans who rebelled against the gods and forsook their protection, shines in the middle of this world, surrounded by towns, sea lanes and woodlands under its protection. But from the frozen north, a witch queen is leading her army on a quest for vengeance against the lords of Kalevala. Ancient ruins from the days when gods dwelled on the earth are opening to unleash forgotten powers, tempting humans and striving to overtake the world. You’ll take on the role of Kipuna, a sharp-witted village girl, who becomes imbued with an ancient power that grants dominion over time and death. You must use your wits to control it as you’re drawn into a war between the city of Kalevala and the armies of the Northlanders driven by their witch queen Lowhee.

Exosuits are grouped into different roles, and players will pilot these exosuits to hold firm against overwhelming dinosaur swarms in online-only, team-based action game modes.

,2024-01-06,"Split is a first-person puzzle game with the unique mechanics of creating copies of yourself and manipulating time. The gameplay combines many different types of puzzles from more and less famous puzzle games and takes them to a whole new perspective. After the recent war, engineers from Epsilon Energy created the Split indestructible shield system. It was to protect individual giant cities covering almost the entire planet from armed conflicts. Different cities have different policies for their citizens. In West Ulrage, every citizen gets a guardian robot at birth. In Hal'Tor, pairs of robots raise several children each. Whereas in Dievez, people are raised in large centers. Most jobs have been taken over by machines. People work mainly as mechanics, programmers, or operators. The Split control panel is riddled with numerous traps that will require both good reflexes and composure. You can try to destroy enemies or escape from them by using time manipulation and your own clones to distract them. The game's design refers to Brutalism, an architectural style popular around the 1970s. It was promoted, among others, by the game Control. We mixed this style with the digital environment from Tron: Legacy. The levels are full of nooks and crannies, which may seem empty at first glance, but lead to interesting places.

,2024-01-06,"It is now the Taisho era in a world similar to olden Japan during a period of rapid economic growth. Fighter jets, tanks, and battleships have entered the war, and giants known as Guardians and Mugen are tearing their way through the battlefield. This is the exciting stage of Akai Katana Shin, a horizontal shoot 'em up game. The Japanese-inspired military game visuals and gorgeous character designs portray a dramatic story of clashes between family and old friends. These elements are tied together by strategic game mechanics, which feature a wide variety of attack methods to experiment with. Find out for yourself why this game has such a strong base of ardent fans! Contains Three Titles From Cave's Akai Katana Series Akai Katana The first arcade game of the series released in 2010. Supports two players. Akai Katana Shin A home console version with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and new game features such as Hagane and Katana. Akai Katana Zetsu Based on Akai Katana with an aspect ratio of 16:9. Game mechanics have been adjusted for balance. From Strategy Crafting to Score Attack—Versatile Enough to Play It Your Way The player unit known as Fighter can switch between its normal form and a giant ninja known as Guardian using Soul-shift. The unit also comes equipped with two different bullet shots. Attack Mode has more power and Defense Mode boosts mobility. Make good use of a combination of forms and modes to break through enemy ranks and destroy them. Soul-shift is a crucial technique that boosts the player for a short while. In Akai Katana and Akai Katana Zetsu, timing the shift well can block enemy bullets even on a screen that's full of them. In Akai Katana Shin, generate and fire a Katana shot to quickly defeat strong enemies. The highlight of this title is the ability to negate or dispel attacks instead of simply avoiding them. Make good use of Soul-shift to turn the tide in your favor and earn a higher score. Quality Game Modes Packed With Features Settings: Adjust options such as sound volume and screen display. Turn Screen Frame on to see captions for character voices during the game. Training: Specify a stage and adjust your unit's condition to carry out individual training. Score Attack: See how far you can go with only one life. No continues or restarts allowed. Rank and replays can be saved separately from normal gameplay. Online Leaderboard: See how your score compares against other players online. Replay: Record and save gameplay data from start to end of session. Other than playing and pausing the replay, you can also use the Edit function to jump right into the game from a specific point in time. Daisuke Matsumoto's New Soundtrack Masterpieces Daisuke Matsumoto, music composer of Gothic wa Mahou Otome and sound effects producer for the Akai Katana series, returns with exciting new musical arrangements for the game's soundtrack. You can switch between three different versions of BGM for this game, including the original audio and new tracks created for Akai Katana Shin.",2023-12-22,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202210/1803/00Vh8uzex0ULjUCzmqqan3Vr.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6026-CUSA40396_00-0717218508175019,,30%,,Shooter,20.99,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202210/1803/00Vh8uzex0ULjUCzmqqan3Vr.png,,Akai Katana Shin,USD,Clear River Games AB,2023-06-29,akai-katana-shin-ps4-us,,0,29.99,,20.99,1

On the murky remains of the New England coastline stands a lighthouse Sanctuary where Custodian and Chimera once performed unspeakable experiments in a prison of pain. Their tools now become yours. Explore punishing new avenues of creativity with the traps and genetic abominations used to rule this secret facility. CLAIM FOR FREE - Claim the Sector 1 Arsenal Pack for FREE from June 27th to July 10th and add these lethal tools to your next build. Please note that this is a time limited promo in which the content is free from 27/06/2023 to 10/07/2023, with the Sector 1 Arsenal Pack content reverting to full price on 10/07/2023. The Dreadshore Arsenal Pack contains: ? 1 CUSTODIAN:? - Nautilus Enhance the effects of defensive weaponry and increase your odds of survival against any onslaught. This armor, resembling an ancient diving suit, was developed in secret by the only prisoner to escape the lighthouse Sanctuary. Nautilus, a terror from the depths who came to drown the last of humanity. 1 TRAP:? -Sentry Beam This trap was developed by the lighthouse Sanctuary to swiftly execute any prisoner bold enough to pursue escape. The Sentry Beam’s watchful red eye uses motion-tracking to lock onto a target and emit a narrow laser beam of super-heated amplified light – perfect for slicing through fast-moving Raiders. Should the beam miss its mark, it ricochets multiple times offering additional opportunity for a chaotic, blistering kill. 1 GUARD:? -Ravager Both ruthless brute and precise killer, the Ravager is a disturbing result of the lighthouse Sanctuary’s failed cloning experiments. Its visor alters its vision to display multiple blurred targets when only one is present, causing it to simultaneously fire at each in a scattershot attack more difficult to evade than a single bolt. Efficient and aggressive, the Ravager is an imposing addition to any Outpost’s defenses. 1 WEAPON:? -Demolition Cannon Discovered in the Sanctuary’s armory by Nautilus during his blood-soaked escape, the Demolition Cannon was used to decimate any who stood in his path. Powerful and portable, this heavy artillery delivers an explosive payload in a reusable shell for a localized explosion that causes massive damage.",2023-12-22,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/1912/484261e7e6b958fb2dd9e948c3fc07bd285efa5aa6ab2d3a.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4939-PPSA05722_00-0000000000DLC006,,30%,,"Action, Strategy, Action",4.79,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/1912/484261e7e6b958fb2dd9e948c3fc07bd285efa5aa6ab2d3a.png,,Meet Your Maker: Sector 1 Arsenal Pack,USD,Behaviour Interactive Inc.,2023-06-27,meet-your-maker-sector-1-arsenal-pack-ps4&ps5-us,,1,7.99,,5.59,1

CREATE THE PARKS OF YOUR DREAMS As creative lead of the park, you can let your imagination off the leash!

,2024-01-18,"NEW IN TOUR DE FRANCE 2023 - All 21 official stages of the Tour de France 2023 - Updated rider and team ratings - New Medium Mountain and Agility rating added - New grupettos between riders added - New challenges added to Race of the Moment mode - Distinctive bibs added for super combative and the best team - Improved rider behaviour and trajectories for more realistic races - Updated equipment items and official brands- PLAY TO THE STRENGTHS OF YOUR RIDERS To add more realism to races and more variety in the race to win the Tour de France, ratings for Medium Mountain and Agility have been added. Based on the rider selected, playing and controlling your rider is now different. It's easier to reach maximum speed and to take certain trajectories tightly with a rider like Wout van Aert than with Primož Rogli?. But be careful, because the lower the Downhill and Agility ratings of your cyclist, the more control you need! STAND OUT FROM OTHER RIDERS To add more immersion to the core of Tour de France 2023, we added two new bibs this year. You can now see and wear the super combative bib and the best team bib. Prove you deserve to wear these distinctions by showing your panache! As in real life, riders can form a grupetto to make a breakaway or if they have fallen behind. This helps to limit damage during difficult stages and conserve energy for future stages or the end of the race. SMOOTHER RACES In Tour de France 2023, trajectories and collisions have been redesigned so you can navigate within the peloton more easily. Thanks to these improvements, you can reposition yourself more easily and prepare for the end of the race as ideally as possible. All ratings have been updated based on the results of the riders' last season so that they reflect reality and the latest performances of professional cyclists. The Race of the Moment mode has also been updated with new challenges, races and optimisations that add more variety. There's also a brand-new mode: Downhill of the Moment.",2024-01-03,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1920/3013b6d4b87338449166288f24b5629f3683d5108933a679.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6665-PPSA14199_00-TDF2300000000000,,70%,,Simulation,11.99,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1920/3013b6d4b87338449166288f24b5629f3683d5108933a679.png,,Tour De France 2023,USD,NACON SA,2023-06-08,tour-de-france-2023-ps4&ps5-us,,1,39.99,,11.99,1

Bringing together the complete Budget Cuts 1 and Budget Cuts 2 games, this epic includes all previously released Budget Cuts content; weapons and enemy variety, arcade levels, game modes, and modifiers into one seamless adventure. In Budget Cuts Ultimate, your very important paper pushing job is being taken over by robots. TransCorp is an expert in the business of manufacturing cost-cutting robots, and now you are about to be “fired”. Is humanity being optimized out of existence altogether? Budget Cuts Ultimate is an action-adventure stealth game set in a dystopian office-scape with tons of evil robots and even more knives (for throwing and stabbing them with!) Use your TransLocator to teleport through the offices, trains, factories, rooftops, and other secret departments of TransCorp.

,2024-01-06,"Wobbledogs is a 3D pet simulation where you raise your own personal hive of rapidly mutating dogs, physically simulated all the way down to their guts! It’s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance. Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection! Dogs need a place to call home, and it’s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you’d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most! The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects. Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it’s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that’s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space.

Whether you are a fan of the series or a first time player, this is the perfect place to start.

Micro Challenge features the ability for the Tile to become micro but it is ALSO a micro sized Tilting Tiles game. Micro Challenge is designed to be a perfect starting point for the franchise.

Step into your own fully immersive throne room with Crusader Kings: Royal Court, and get ready to impress vassals and courtiers with your splendor and treasure on display. Watch visitors pay respect or family members squabble as you pass judgment in royal audiences, establishing the vital link between your people and your realm. In Crusader Kings: Royal Court, you can commission great works of art from inspired craftspeople. Impress your rivals with the grandeur of your court, or awe them with your noble house’s heirlooms and relics. An enhanced Culture system lets you guide your people to novel cultural understandings as they merge or splinter off, embrace their heritage, learn languages, or acquire new traditions. A Royal Court on display ? As King or Emperor, watch as your personal throne room comes to life with the vast range of drama and intrigue of your court. Step into a fully 3D realized space, available in one of four major cultural visual styles, and fill it with regalia and majesty. ? Harsh or benevolent, pass judgment on those seeking arbitration. Hold court and watch as your courtiers scheme and vie for your attention. ? Match yourself against your greatest rival with your court’s grandeur. Or fail to impress them and suffer the sad diplomatic consequences of bad taste. A true treasure ? Show off your exquisitely crafted relics, or focus on your noble house’s history with your family heirlooms. A whole range of new artifacts can be admired in the series’ return of the inventory system. ? Talented craftspeople, from jewelers to weavers, can be employed on special projects, adding even more unique items to your domain. ? Commission special great works of art or win artifacts in battle. Be careful, as they can just as easily be lost in a botched duel or rival’s scheme. Culture and the people ? A greatly overhauled Culture system lies ready at your fingertips. Major new Cultural Traditions allow you to significantly change the way you play, from choosing the right benefits due to your realm’s terrain to giving your military new bonuses. Determine your heritage through Cultural Pillars or have your subjects learn new languages. ? Create a truly dynamic melting pot through the new Hybridisation feature, mixing and matching the defining traits of your people into a unique cultural fusion. Become a great Bedouin conqueror who merges with freshly subjugated people or follow the adventurous Norse ruler who came to adopt the local Sri Lankan ways. ?

It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

,2024-01-06,"In the Trailmakers: Airborne Expansion you will take to the skies in an epic campaign to save the peaceful Chirpos from the pesky Robot Pirate invasion. Campaign In this mission-based campaign you will navigate a brand new Trailmakers-world with deserts, mountains, and beautiful floating islands. The local Chirpo population will grant you increasingly challenging quests as you progress deeper into the dangerous Robot Pirate territory. As you complete their quests you will receive blocks, parts, engines, wings, thrusters and so much more — giving you all the tools you need to soar the skies majestically like an eagle. Friendly- and enemy NPCs The Chirpos are friendly, fuzzy and flightless birds. They hold up in villages scattered across the land — the lucky ones anyway. The less fortunates ones are held in Robot Pirate captivity and the Chirpo Mayor of each village will kindly ask that you bring them home safely. The Robot Pirates are evil, ruthless and quite agile dog fighters. They will defend their newly invaded territory with fighter planes, flak cannons, blimps, hot air balloons and ground speeders. They are a “shoot first, ask later” kind of people so we advise you to implement the same strategy. Sandbox map The new map is a big one — and it’s open for you to explore as you please.

,2024-01-06,"Across the Valley is your friendly farm simulator, developed exclusively for VR. Lend a hand — literally — so that everything can grow and thrive. Sow, water and harvest your own plants. Raise adorable baby animals. Milk the cows, shear the sheep and go on a truffle hunt with the pigs — all in fun mini- and micro-games. The graphics in Across the Valley have a fantastic hand-drawn style. The grass here is lush and green, and the sunsets are golden. Enjoy the idyllic countryside and relax to the sounds of the atmospheric soundtrack. On your farm, there’s something to do every day. Give your plants and animals plenty of love and care! They’ll reward you with a bountiful harvest. You can use your profits to expand your farm — your planning table will let you see it all easily. Features: Action Point Locomotion System: * No Motion Sickness! With the action point locomotion system, no artificial movement is done! * Each action point is designed carefully to have everything you need within the reach of your hands. * Like: Everything you need to shear a sheep is right at the shearing station within your hand’s reach. * Or: Everything you need to work on the fields is at the tool spot. All tools are in reach of your hands. * You can get to an action point with just a blink of an eye. No button learning: * Do everything with your own hands. No extensive button learning is needed. * To dig up a field, take a shovel with you and grab it with two hands. Then dig the field up like you would in the real world. * To sow out seeds, just grab a seed bowl, grab some seeds from it and throw them on the field. Automatic Micro Games: * Instead of typical minigames that interrupt the game, Across the Valley automatically starts and stops a microgame when you perform an action. * An example: Sowing out seeds will automatically start a “seeding” micro-game when the first seed hits the field. The better you distribute the seeds, the more plants grow. Once the seed basket is empty, the microgame finishes and your plants start growing. Stay busy: * 36 tasks (quests) guide you from the basics of seeding to going on a truffle hunt with your pigs. * Infinite orders keep you busy, even after the main game. Cozy mood: * Carefully composed art style that lets you enter a comic-style world. * A well balanced mix of hand-drawn 4k textures and programmed effects create the illusion of a hand-drawn VR world. * Relaxing, exclusive soundtrack that puts you in the right mood. * Upgrade your house to make it look nice and cozy. Until now, you’ve only played farm simulators — but now you can move into your own virtual farm.",2023-12-22,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202307/2514/b3a4deb6448c50cab178e4b2388716fbb5ce5957d31347cd.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP7211-PPSA13758_00-0087399326343949,,50%,,"Family, Casual, Simulation",9.99,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202307/2514/b3a4deb6448c50cab178e4b2388716fbb5ce5957d31347cd.png,,Across the Valley,USD,FusionPlay GmbH,2023-04-06,across-the-valley-ps5-us,,1,19.99,,9.99,0

You are rewarded for surviving every day, but you will have to pay tax after tax until you have barely enough money to scrape by. You will have to use that meager income to buy upgrades, equipment, and hire coworkers. The enemies only grow stronger by each passing day, and you never know when they might eventually overpower you. Every morning, you can buy one card out of three choices. There are over 70 cards, including weapons, coworkers, upgrades, and random chance events.

,2024-01-06,"A gloomy story without words, inspired by poetry, masterpieces of painting from different countries and eras, as well as the aesthetics of Zvyagintsev's early films. About the love of a brother and sister, a harsh upbringing, the continuity of generations and the difficult lot of young people living in the outback.

The father brings up his son and daughter strictly and ascetically, but one day his life is interrupted. Children will have to get to know themselves and make the main life choice - to follow the precepts of their father or choose their own path, succumb to temptation and start a new life.",2023-12-22,,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/2118/82111f80a6c6f0abb2cf23be9e10c906acce3822720f9b2d.png?w=200,,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6695-CUSA42387_00-SISTER0000GAMENA,,30%,,"Unique, Casual",0.69,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202302/2118/82111f80a6c6f0abb2cf23be9e10c906acce3822720f9b2d.png,,Sister,USD,Volkov Konstantin Sergeevich,2023-03-22,sister-ps4-us,,0,0.99,,0.69,1

,2024-01-06,"Unheard – Voices of Crime Edition contains the original Unheard game, an innovative experience that puts players in the role of Acoustic Detectives investigating crime scenes using a new aural device that allows them to hear voices from the past. The voices they hear will help them identify potential suspects and solve the mysteries. What is it that’s connecting seemingly unrelated cases? This edition also contains The Lethal Script case that will have the detectives investigating a movie industry mystery on The Peak Hotel. Put on your headphones and step back into the past. Use the voices you hear to return to crime scenes, tracking down each individual involved and solving the cases. But where do the voices come from? Can you trust what you hear? And what's the mysterious thread weaving all of these cases together? A Unique Case-Solving Experience Discover the truth hidden in the voices from the past. Step through time as you use our device to eavesdrop on conversations from past crime scenes. Every clue, every move, and every motive will be presented in the form of audio. Rather than controlling any one character, you only need listen to their conversations, following along as the story evolves. Use the information you hear to match names to voices and determine how everything (and everyone) is related. Can you discover the truth? Open-Ended Narrative Mystery Game Explore the story and piece together the puzzle in your own way! Don't expect to be fed a pile of clues.

,2024-01-06,"A cascade of words, color, shapes and sound flows around your turret as you desperately fight off swarms of inbound attackers. If enemies penetrate your perimeter you need to zoom into close range combat and beat them back, adjusting to a completely different perspective in the blink of an eye. Welcome to Jeff Minter’s Akka Arrh. This modern take from the fine developers at Llamasoft combines the intrigue of an incredibly rare Atari arcade prototype with a unique creative vision that delivers a wave shooter that is insanely addictive. Akka Arrh drips with Minter’s sense of humor, love of psychedelic color, and ability to create games that are a joy to play. Key Features: Pure arcade bliss! You'll be thrown directly into the action where combos, high scores, and survival are your only goals. Create massive chains of enemy explosions and rack up ammo for precision shots to keep a combo and your rings (or life force) protected. Lose them all, and it’s game over. Start from the beginning of the 50 unique levels, or pick up where you left off to power through to the end. Accessibility! Sensitive to flashing lights or just not a fan? Not to worry, as there is an option to disable the more intense visual effects so that the experience can be enjoyed by a wider audience.",2023-12-22,/game/118249,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/2216/RR6HkCCpeYX65wLfl1vGsP6V.png?w=200,0,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0182-CUSA36608_00-7828307137432495,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RouTQpN3Z9Y,30%,0,Shooter,11.99,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/2216/RR6HkCCpeYX65wLfl1vGsP6V.png,,Akka Arrh,USD,Atari Inc.,2023-02-21,akka-arrh-ps4-us,,0,19.99,0,13.99,1

,2024-01-06,"The Gods have abandoned Midgard. Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.",2023-12-22,/game/70710,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png?w=200,5,Playstation,https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6963-CUSA40869_00-0002575215184082,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqwwdGneIG4,75%,15,"Action, Adventure, Music/Rhythm",3.74,https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202301/0312/cGadn5dBXloBX3z6T1d6YMuT.png,,ATONE: Heart of the Elder Tree,USD,Untold Tales S.A.,2023-02-10,atone-heart-of-the-elder-tree-ps4-us,,0,14.99,6,3.74,1
