Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.<br />CAMPAIGN<br />Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. Youâre the only human there, after all.<br />SURVIVAL<br />Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. <br />SANDBOX<br />If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game â including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions.<br />BASE BUILDING<br />Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission.<br />EXPLORATION<br />Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology.<br />CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY<br />The Riftbreakerâ¢âs gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.",

Seeking to avenge their defeat in the last great war from a thousand years ago, the demons have challenged the gods who humiliated them and have invaded the human realm, threatening them with extinction.<br />Thinking that their enemies had been utterly defeated in the last great war, a thousand years ago, the humans had fallen into a false sense of security, forgetting the ways of alchemy, while enjoying the peace. Unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons.<br />Amidst the chaos, as cities and fortresses fell, and as young children were abducted from their homes, a young girl named Raji is chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race.<br /><br />Experience a story of siblings. Raji and Golu are sister and brother who have been separated by the attacking demonic hordes and now find themselves in the middle of the great war.<br />Raji has taken it upon herself to find her brother and put an end to this reckless war. However, this can only happen if she manages to break down the might and stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.<br /><br />Inspired by Indian mythologies such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, and by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, Raji: An Ancient Epic brings a refreshing new style to the action-adventure scene!<br />Every corner of the game's environment is drawn in the Pahari art style and combines hand-painted textures, rendered in 3D giving the Raji: An Ancient Epic a stunning and unique visual quality rarely seen in games.<br /><br />Diverse weapons and powers, gifted to Raji by the gods, are at your disposal. Mastering them all will be vital to your success as the demonic hordes will skillfully adapt to each and every situation; while the Trishul may be perfect for one battle, the mighty Sharanga bow may be needed for the next.<br /><br />For the very first time, experience a game set in ancient India and infused with Hindu and Balinese mythology. You will find yourself immersed in ancient India where every corner is begging to be explored.<br />From enchanting stories from the lore of the game to tightly packed battles against ferocious demons and bosses, ancient puzzles, massive forts and palaces, experience a sibling story who find themselves at the center of a divine war.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

In this unique game, recreated entirely in the charming 8-bit pixel art style of The Escapists, you play as Rick Grimes as he takes on hordes of zombies let loose upon the world.<br /><br />Rick is in charge of a band of survivors featuring many of the original comic book cast, including Maggie, Hershel, Glenn and Michonne.  Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meriwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.<br /><br />Protect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic's epic story.<br /><br />The Escapists. © 2015.

Four levels of difficulty, six worlds to conquer, twelve mid and end-of-level bosses, seven god-like armour sets, five basic weapons and thirty-five magic combat spells!<br /><br />The evil emperor Zaraaima has kidnapped the infant heir to the land of Dareca. King Kandar must call upon the aid of the seven gods of Dareca as he traverses the six worlds of his kingdom in a bid to save his son. He must face the emperor's hordes as he battles through dark woods, slimy swamps, sinister mills, infernal volcanos, snowy mountains, golden cities and demonic castles. Each world is guarded by level bosses each sworn to bring about the king's swift demise. To help him in his quest King Kandar can invoke god-given armour, wield different weapons and cast fanatical spells. Can the King save his son and his kingdom or will Dareca fall into the evil emperor's grasp? <br /><br />Cast of the Seven Godsends - Redux is developed by Raven Travel Studios, production support from IV Productions and published by Merge Games Ltd. © 2015.

Solo – Islands of the Heart explores the theme of love in an introspective way, allowing players to identify and reflect on their own experiences.<br /><br />The world is divided into archipelagos, with each island representing a unique puzzle. Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.<br /><br />As with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island.<br /><br />Nature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.",

In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect.<br /><br />In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online!<br /><br />Featuring<br /><br />Up to 4 players: Play locally AND online with up to 4 players.<br /><br />Easy to pick up, hard to master gameplay: Start off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts.<br /><br />Tons of unlockable extras and secrets: Unlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure.<br /><br />Play on your own: Step up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City.<br /><br />Modes and options:Pick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley...<br /><br />Wicked Tracks: A Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen.",

        "description": "● Buy the digital PS5 version of  “Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy” from PlayStationStore and download the PS4 version at no extra cost when it launches on  January 26th, 2021.<br /><br />Screen Languages: English, French<br />*French language text will be added via a patch.<br /><br />This story takes place three years after the events of the previous game “Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout,” and depicts the reunion of Ryza and her friends, who go through new encounters and goodbyes to discover a true priceless treasure.<br /><br />《The Story》<br />Three years have passed since Ryza's secret grand adventure on Kurken Island. Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life.<br /><br />《Main Features》<br />■ Exploring with new field actions!<br />Ryza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively.<br />■ More action-filled real-time battles!<br />Take on your enemies using an improved “real-time tactics” battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever. Speedily switch between characters, choose varied skills, and utilize items in just the right moments for best results.<br />■ Straightforward and easy-to-use synthesis!<br />Utilize several new synthesis systems, including the new intuitive “Linkage Synthesis” system where items are placed in cells called “Material Loops”, that are designed to allow both new players to easily learn synthesis, and experienced players to create unique customized items. Created items can also be mixed and matched with “Evolution Link” to create entirely new items.<br /><br />Note:<br />- Please visit the official website for more information on the listed content: https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/ryza2/<br />- Sets that include the main game, such as “Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy Digital Deluxe Edition” and “Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy Ultimate Edition” are also currently on sale.",

        "description": "Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes.<br /><br />Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name.<br /><br />Don't be fooled—this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown!<br /><br />Story<br /><br />A long time ago...<br /><br />In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.<br />The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.<br />...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames,<br />a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.<br /><br />The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.<br />Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.<br />And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.<br />While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.<br /><br />In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.<br />To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy!<br /><br />Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins.<br /><br />In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these—and more—to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!<br /><br />In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!<br /><br />Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it!<br /><br />On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience—a first for the series.<br /><br />Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side.<br />Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported.<br /><br />Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br />Offline play enabled",

Banish these creatures from our world, and you will be paid generously—and given the chance to buy more gruesome and powerful weapons. Fail, and death will strip you of both character and gear. Your experience, however, remains in your pool of hunters—called your Bloodline—always.<br /><br />Hunt's competitive, match-based gameplay mixes PvP and PvE elements to create a uniquely tense experience where your life, your character, and your gear are always on the line. At the beginning of each Bounty Hunt match, up to 12 players set out to track their monstrous targets. Depending on which mode and team options you've chosen, that 12 will include a combination of solo players and teams of two or three. Once they've found and defeated one of these they will receive a bounty—and instantly become a target for every other Hunter left on the map.",

It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece.<br /><br />For the solo voyager, the ship's computer-controlled cat will keep you company. Without a second pair of hands, Albert will need an extra dose of dexterity to navigate the challenges of Victorian space flight.<br /><br />The mix of action and thoughtful puzzles make 39 Days to Mars perfect for playing in short sessions. The entire adventure fits comfortably into an evening, or a long tea break.<br /><br />The HMS Fearful is ready to embark for Mars!<br /><br />1-2 players<br />380MB minimum save size",

But unlike its protagonist, Cinders is not afraid of taking fate into her own hands. Even if it means breaking the rules...<br /><br />The game takes a look at four women and what made them who they are. It's a story about freedom, dreams, sisterhood, and finding your own Happily Ever After that may not exactly agree with the stale morals of classic fairytales.<br /><br />With multiple endings, 120 decision points, and over 300 choices, Cinders gives you total control over the main character's personality and how her story unfolds.",

Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as ‘Shard' spreads throughout the underworld. With the city's future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city's fate.<br /><br />Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace.

Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld.

Your destiny is yours to write.<br /><br />The World:<br />The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America's cities.<br /><br />These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

This includes features such as taunts, character-specific intros, and even Super Moves! <br />ART OF FIGHTING 1 and ART OF FIGHTING 2 primarily focus on the Sakazaki family and their escapades in South Town, with the goal of rescuing Yuri Sakazaki or taking down the corrupt police commissioner Geese Howard, respectively. ART OF FIGHTING 3 goes in a different direction, with the plot focusing on family friend of the Sakazaki's, Robert Garcia, as he travels to Mexico to search for a childhood friend.<br />This release also includes the option to switch between the original arcade soundtrack and a bonus arrange soundtrack, along with the option to customize characters with a color-edit system.<br /><br />This title has been converted from the original PlayStation2 version to the PS4 system. Consequently, there may be times where the title plays differently from the PlayStation2 version, or where some features may not function properly. This version does not support PlayStation2 peripherals, therefore some functionality may not be available.",

Along their way they will have to avoid raider attacks, investigate military headquarters, and infiltrate into the territory of a dangerous anti-technological religious sect. On the trail of her whereabouts, they will travel and fight shoulder to shoulder, and they inevitably get to know the others. Depending on some strategic and personal decisions, you will guide this characters right to one of three possible endings.",

Ozyasu should escape from the earth before their secrets are solved, however, AREA 51 is a maximum security facility and designed to do experiments on aliens.<br /><br />They know that even if they escape from this well-protected prison, they will be killed as soon as they are detected. So they have to be very careful. The thing that humans don't know is Ozyasu is able to capture the human body and control it, but it is never enough because there are many security puzzles to be solved even if it captures the human body in the area. There will be many puzzles to solve and many doors to open on their way.<br /><br />In this game, where mystery and excitement never diverge, only those who can cope with stress and show their skill with cold blood will be successful, for others, the inevitable end is very close. Keep your secret and survive in this story-driven first-person stealth, puzzle-solving game.<br /><br />Capture the body: Be one of them.

        "description": "Inspired by the naughty back room arcades of ‘90s Japan, Bishoujo Battle Cyber Panic! offers the instant gratification of a sub-genre that's both easy to learn and fun to master. Start each action-packed stage with a silhouetted girl behind the playfield and dodge enemies while drawing lines that cut away when connected, methodically uncovering the image underneath.<br /><br />It's a game of risk-vs-reward as you capture as much of the playfield as possible without enemies or bullets crossing your path. Will you whittle away at smaller and safer zones along the edge, or will you go for higher scores by cutting into enemy territory? Box in power-ups to use their effects, unlock completed images in the gallery and share your victories across online leaderboards!<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />• Rescue anime-style mecha girls in 50 unique stages!<br />• Decide your own strategy in freeform gameplay.<br />• Adapt to gradually increasing difficulty.<br />• Unlock special 5-star challenges with the girls in alternate outfits!<br />• View your captured images in Gallery mode.<br />• Enjoy a pumping soundtrack that will get you in the mood.<br />• Share high scores with online leaderboards!",

        "description": "Prepare yourself for the dangers of the cursed castle! Explore 6 x 6 x 6 = 216 rooms of randomly generated hazards and enemies in a retro adventure!<br /><br />Countless heroes have tried and failed to destroy the ancient spell that holds the castle walls. Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside, guarding the sword shards — the last known thing to be capable of defeating the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure.<br /><br />Although you are not alone — some help could be obtained from the merchants, who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them to disappear...<br /><br />Plan your every step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option. There are two difficulty modes: PAL/NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch.<br /><br />Just like in old NES games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found…<br /><br />Features:<br /><br />- Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming.<br />- Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock.<br />- Randomly generated castle, 216 rooms to overcome.<br />- Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

Following the arrest of a prominent community leader, New York stands in disarray. Suspicions and allegations run rife throughout the city, as an insidious drug known as ‘Shard' spreads throughout the underworld. With the city's future in doubt, three hardened citizens rise to discover the truth and uncover a conspiracy threatening to alter the city's fate.<br /><br />Inspired by tech noir classics, Disjunction is an intensely atmospheric stealth-action RPG that follows a trinity of interwoven narratives, and features a reactive story where your actions have real, persistent consequences. Choose your playstyle and use an arsenal of futuristic tech, cybernetic upgrades and weapons to blast through levels in brutally fast combat, or take a silent approach by using stealth and non-lethal takedowns to leave without a trace. Nobody needs to die… unless you decide they must.<br /><br />Key Features:<br />Challenging stealth-action gameplay that lets you play the way that suits your style, whether it's sneaking through levels or attacking head-on<br />Three playable characters, each with individual abilities, cybernetic upgrades and talents to customise your playstyle<br />A reactive story where the player's choices have real consequences<br />Stylized pixel art environments and characters<br />Atmospheric musical score by composer Dan Farley<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />Disjunction features unique stealth-action mechanics and abilities for each of its three playable characters, giving players the freedom and flexibility to choose the playstyle that suits them. Tackle encounters in lethal, high-octane combat, or use your wits to stick to the shadows, utilizing distraction techniques and non-lethal attacks to reach your objective.<br /><br />Augmentation:<br />Unlock cybernetic upgrades to augment your abilities via upgrade trees, and build upon your playstyle to improve your stealth or increase the lethality of attacks through talent trees. Find upgrade kits to reach your true potential and become a feared killer or remain anonymous throughout New York's shady underground.<br /><br />Reactive Story:<br />Experience a reactive story shaped by your actions. Your approach to situations can have serious consequences for the future of New York City, with the repercussions of choosing to spare or kill even one person rippling throughout the underworld. Crush entire factions or convince them to aid your cause. Your destiny is yours to write.<br /><br />The World:<br />The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America's cities.<br /><br />These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

        "description": "This compilation contains some of SNK fan's favorite titles from the REAL BOUT FATAL FURY series.<br /><br />REAL BOUT FATAL FURY is the only Fatal Fury title with bounds, and characters who are pushed out of bounds lose the round in a comical way, which can lead to unexpected comebacks.There are 16 playable characters in the game. This title also concludes the story that started in the original FATAL FURY.<br /><br />In REAL BOUT FATAL FURY SPECIAL the series drops the 3rd line introduced in FATAL FURY 3. Krauser, Tung Fu Rue, Cheng Sinzan and Laurence Blood also make their return in this game. Geese also makes an unexpected return as Nightmare Geese.<br /><br />In REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2 the system has been changed up a bit so that the 2nd line is mostly used for evasion and throwing your opponent. Three new characters are also included in this title: Li Xiangfei, Rick Strowd, and Alfred. The first two are new playable characters, while Alred is a secret boss.<br /><br />This title has been converted from the original PlayStation2 version to the PS4 system. Consequently, there may be times where the title plays differently from the PlayStation2 version, or where some features may not function properly. This version does not support PlayStation2 peripherals, therefore some functionality may not be available.",

But as more victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, will the scales of justice tip in favor of defending the law or enacting vengeance?<br /><br />From the studio that brought you the Yakuza series, Lost Judgment weaves elements of investigative sleuthing, noir narrative and action combat into one mystery thriller. Take your detective expertise to the streets of Japan and defend those that the law fails to protect.<br /><br />INVESTIGATIVE ACTION  <br />Tap into Yagami's arsenal of private eye tricks to gather clues. From hi-tech gadgets including drones and social media listening devices to hardboiled gumshoe methods like scaling buildings and tracking suspects in the city. No stronger evidence than catching a suspect in the act.<br /><br />FREEFORM COMBAT  <br />Master Yagami's three unique, combo-heavy martial arts styles to overcome any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Further weaponize street fights with traffic cones, street signs, bicycles and beyond, plus customize each style with skill trees.<br /><br />DEEP UNDERCOVER<br />Go undercover at a local high school as a club advisor to get to the root of a mysterious rise in delinquency as it relates to the case. Join the Dance Club, where you'll be grooving to the rhythm; the Robotics Club, tasking your ingenuity to build the ultimate Yagami-bot; a boxing gym, to stick and move against fierce opponents; and a bike gang, where underground racing is the only way to earn respect.<br /><br />HIT THE STREETS  <br />As you comb the open cities of Kamurocho and Ijincho in pursuit of the case, take a break and get to know the unique culture of each through bars and other nightlife hotspots. It may be worth taking on a Side Case to lend your detective skills to residents in need – you never know who holds what cards.",

A bystander's video footage of his attempt to flee the scene and subsequent apprehension is all over the news, and public outcry demands a maximum sentence.<br /><br />“Three days ago, a dead body was found in an abandoned building in Yokohama. Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room.<br /><br />His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further.<br /><br />How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up?

They climbed from the bottom of the tower up to the surface, filled with hope...<br /><br />But outside were thousands of corpses soaking in a sea of blood. There stood beings known as Massacre Pink, smiling. In that moment, hope was destroyed. The group was torn asunder, with Jack and the Blood Maidens scattered to their own paths.<br /><br />Separated, they are each drawn to the devouring Jail that floats in the sky...<br />This is the finale to the tale of the Blood Maidens.",
