Akihiro Ehara stands accused of groping a woman on a crowded train. A bystander’s video footage of his attempt to flee the scene and subsequent apprehension is all over the news, and public outcry demands a maximum sentence. “Three days ago, a dead body was found in an abandoned building in Yokohama. Have you identified it yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room. His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to investigate this further. How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice? From just a single stumble, one can become a monster… LAW AND DISORDER - Lost Judgment once again puts players in the sneakers of lawyer turned street-fighting detective Takayuki Yagami. Joined by his partner, ex-yazuka Masaharu Kaito, the crime-fighting duo is called on to investigate a seemingly perfect crime whose lead suspect has an airtight alibi. What starts out as a tale of revenge reveals a tangled web of conspiracy involving several unlikely factions taking advantage of a broken law system. But as victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, he must choose between defending the law or exacting justice. FREEFORM COMBAT - Yagami’s distinct martial arts forms grant him mastery of any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns. Harness Crane, Tiger, and the new Snake stance, a graceful style that can deflect and return an opponent's strikes, using their energy against them. INVESTIGATIVE ACTION - Yagami’s arsenal of detective tricks grows with new gadgets, stealthily tracking suspects, and crafty methods of infiltration. Leave no stone unturned in pursuit of the truth. NO PLACE FINER – Immerse yourself in the bustling downtowns of Tokyo and Yokohama at your own pace within an authentic setting that only the RGG Studio can deliver. Game at Club SEGA, find your next favorite hangout, take on cases from locals need, and beyond.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202106/1115/wQDzz8HqbaRvFqVKWDiy9qdQ.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0177-PPSA03775_00-LOSTJUDGMENT0000","MainStory":24,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":104,"genre":"Action","id":"EP0177-PPSA03775_00-LOSTJUDGMENT0000","PlusPrice":0,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/lost-judgment/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Popularity":"","Title":"Lost Judgment","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"SEGA EUROPE LTD","ReleaseDate":"2021-09-23","Slug":"lost-judgment-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1629.00","MainExtra":52,"SalePrice":"407.25","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"83","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"/game/89877","description":"Previous special offer price valid from 31-01-2024 to 14-02-2024 was (Â£14.99 / €17.99 / AU $25.48 / BGN 35.7 / CZK 425.7 / DKK 134.7 / HUF 6297 / NZ $31.48 / NOK 197.7 / PLN 74.7 / SEK 191.7 / USD $N/A / ZAR 320.7 / HRK 17.99 / INR 1049 / TRY 128.7 / ILS 71.7) This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game.

Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment. DRIVE TO SURVIVE It’s you and your station wagon against an unforgiving, vicious world. It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows. INVESTIGATE THE ZONE The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you. REPEAT Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants. The golden rule in the Zone is ‘nothing ventured, nothing gained’ — some materials can only be found in the most dangerous places. Be smart out there, and don’t waste time — it’s going to be a long haul.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202311/0710/516003921755aa5cb8873cb08c22b172141e997a0d5cd075.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6847-PPSA17476_00-00000000000PS5EU","MainStory":20,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":44,"genre":"Action, Driving/Racing","id":"EP6847-PPSA17476_00-00000000000PS5EU","PlusPrice":599.2,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pacific-drive/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","Popularity":"","Title":"Pacific Drive","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Kepler Interactive Limited","ReleaseDate":"2024-02-21","Slug":"pacific-drive-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"749.00","MainExtra":30,"SalePrice":"599.20","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"77","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"","description":"Build the car of your dreams in our biggest rally game ever, EA SPORTSâ„¢ WRC, the all-new official videogame of the FIA World Rally Championship, the first developed by the award-winning team behind the DiRT Rally series.

In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities. These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are often ineffective due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202009/0311/EcTm14LTNjRgt0qM2gHT4502.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2520-CUSA23292_00-2988533598676746","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"88%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP2520-CUSA23292_00-2988533598676746","PlusPrice":47.88,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/disjunction/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Popularity":"","Title":"Disjunction","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Fireshine Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-01-27","Slug":"disjunction-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"399.00","MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":"47.88","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"70","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"/game/81289","description":"Get your super spoons ready and whack those crazy rabbits into saucepans to free the space chefs - but think fast or the bunnies will attack!

Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled—this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these—and more—to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience—a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0102-CUSA24163_00-MAKAIRE000000001","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"67%","Completionist":9,"genre":"Action","id":"EP0102-CUSA24163_00-MAKAIRE000000001","PlusPrice":247.17,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Popularity":"","Title":"Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"CE EUROPE LIMITED","ReleaseDate":"2021-05-31","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"749.00","MainExtra":6,"SalePrice":"247.17","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"1990-01-01","LowestPrice":"/game/81245","description":"A rat's dream has been left unfulfilled before his death...that is, until he gets a second chance at life!

Thankfully, you can control them. Capture them and teach them to farm or fight. They will help you defend your camp while you explore the world looking for… a new paradise. Welcome to ParadiZe! Do you want your very own zombie companion? A faithful friend that protects you from its peers and accompanies you on all your adventures? At ParadiZe, we make it happen! Here, the zombies do all the dirty work. In the beautiful country of ParadiZe, ingenious survivors are testing a technology that can be used to control the zombies that have overrun the world. Once hacked, they become invaluable allies, even though they are not that smart and sometimes rather unstable. It's not all rosy in ParadiZe, but if you're reasonably clever and handy, maybe you'll manage to survive… A destination with plenty of surprises Explore ParadiZe and meet a colourful cast of extraordinary characters. The unusual flora and fauna will surprise you at every turn. Set out on adventure, in the snow or desert, alone or with your Zombot companions, and feel free to get rid of any pests that try to disturb your stay with us. Fancy an expedition into the wilderness or would you prefer to laze about at your camp? It's your choice, so tailor your stay as you see fit! However, we recommend not getting too close to the locals: they can be somewhat… aggressive. Home sweet home Shortly after arriving, you must build your camp, a cosy little nest that you can gradually upgrade. Comfort is important, but don't forget to set up defences! Add multiple traps and fortifications to repel zombies, which have the bad habit of never leaving you alone. It takes effort to maintain a camp, but if you don't like such menial tasks, don't worry: as we already told you, zombies do all the dirty work here. The more the merrier… You can be a loner during your stay or more sociable. Invite up to three of your friends so they can enjoy this unforgettable experience with you.

Brace your loins with up to four players to run ‘n’ gun as dozens of different bros and eliminate the opposing terrorist forces that threaten our way of life. Unleash scores of unique weapons and set off incredible chain reactions of fire, napalm, and limbs in the name of freedom. Features: The Broforce: Deliver your own brand of shock and awe with dozens of bros each with their own unique weaponry and special attacks designed to dispatch freedom across the world. Bro-Op & Deathmatch: Battle terrorism with up to four players in cooperative mode or sever ties with your bros and face each other in several bombastic competitive modes. Fully Destructible Everything: Destructible terrain opens up a slew of strategic options while the abundance of Exploding Red Barrels of Justiceâ„¢ can literally level the playing field with one shot. *** Broforce Forever Update *** Broforce Forever, the long-awaited free update to 2015’s most patriotic video game, held back from freedom-loving gamers for a crime it didn’t commit, has promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade and unleashes a megaton of Kentucky-fried carnage into the face of evil. The final update offers an improved and expanded campaign with new unlocks, along with six new ultra patriotic bros, four new democracy-spreading challenge levels, and the ultimate expression of military might – bug fixes! The best way for a returning player to enjoy this is to play through the entire campaign again. And again. Forever. NEW BROS Harness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Seth Brondle, wield Xebro’s flying Chakram, serenade (and grenade) terrorism with the flamenco firebrand Desperabro, or become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer! If sniping is more your style, famed bug hunter Bro Gummer brings pinpoint liberation with his trusty rifle, while Demolition Bro’s Freeze Grenades put evildoers right back where they belong… ON ICE. NEW BADDIES A Bro only becomes a force when confronted with those who seek to destroy their freedoms, and in Broforce Forever, the terrorists are even more determined to delete democracy. Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice. NEW CHALLENGES Bros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards. Succeed and unlock one of four new flexes that can be deployed by any Bro, any time, any place. Just like freedom. ***","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1206/ZBrZdWMpe8J5dHsXfJxWsGHr.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3643-CUSA03887_00-00000BROFORCEPS4","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":16,"genre":"Action, Action, Action","id":"EP3643-CUSA03887_00-00000BROFORCEPS4","PlusPrice":75.8,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/broforce/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Popularity":"","Title":"Broforce","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Devolver Digital","ReleaseDate":"2016-02-29","Slug":"broforce-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"379.00","MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":"75.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"67","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"/game/105501","description":"Prepare for an legendary Action RPG with intense souls-like combat.

Step into the shoes of special agent Dalila Reyes, a former government spy now in the service of a unit called H.A.D.E.S. (Hexacore Advanced Division for Extraction and Search), and get ready to enter the most advanced experimental research center in the United States of America. Be careful, though, because in the darkness of the desolate, labyrinthine depths of the military research center there is something creepy and lethal awaiting you! Grab one of the most innovative and technologically advanced weapons of all time and prepare to face never-before-seen creatures while you make your way through a series of frightfully evocative settings all ready to be discovered. A perfect mix of fierce and deadly enemies, hardcore action game mechanics, environmental puzzles, a chilling soundtrack, plenty of exploration and massive doses of concentrated horror wait for you in Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle. No place is safe, especially when you’re being hunted by your nightmares. Game features: - New characters and big comebacks – take part in the top secret \"Sandcastle\" mission as the game's main protagonist, Special Agent H.A.D.E.S. Dalila Reyes, and reconstruct the past of some of Daymare: 1998's most beloved characters. - Lethal and terrifying enemies – fight, kill and dismember the new enemies that stand between you and the resolution of your mission, so frighteningly intelligent, aggressive and realistic in every detail. - Revamped interface – the D.I.D. is back, though in a completely redesigned way. Manage your inventory, ammo and health items directly from the new game interface, which has never been so simple and intuitive. - Eye to the Scanner – thanks to the innovative device installed on Reyes’s arm, you can analyze portions of the environment and reveal new puzzles to solve, pick up secret documents and detect hidden items! - Environmental puzzles – the solution is often right in front of your eyes! Search for all the clues and overcome the environmental obstacles to obtain resources and collectibles. - Are you sure it’s dead? – in Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle, prepare to confront the toughest and most aggressive enemies you have ever seen. Moreover, even if you’re sure you’ve killed one, you’ll find out it can come back in a completely new form and even deadlier than before! - Breathtaking and immersive graphics, sound effects and soundtrack – thanks to the power of Unreal Engine 4, you will live the most terrifying of experiences! - Back to the 90s… again! – if you loved the nostalgia of Daymare: 1998, in Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle will feel like you’re living and playing a typical action horror/film of the 90s. Expect to be transported back in time to many familiar references and a frightfully authentic atmosphere with a retro flavor. - Freeze! – there will certainly be no shortage of guns, but prepare to equip one of the most innovative and powerful weapons ever created: the Frost Grip! WARNING: it may contain liquid nitrogen. - Veteran or rookie – choose the most appropriate game difficulty based on your ability in combat and your experience with survival horror. Either way, it will be a serious challenge for the faint-hearted!","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202308/2905/7d6304b405fe7ef516919e8b6d72a4e393b154f529513de5.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3896-PPSA09482_00-2980564068983062","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":10,"genre":"Horror, Action","id":"EP3896-PPSA09482_00-2980564068983062","PlusPrice":659.25,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/daymare-1994-sandcastle/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5","Popularity":"","Title":"Daymare: 1994 Sandcastle","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"INVADER STUDIOS S.R.L.","ReleaseDate":"2023-08-30","Slug":"daymare-1994-sandcastle-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"879.00","MainExtra":9,"SalePrice":"659.25","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"65","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"/game/72618","description":"Serious Sam 4 reignites the classic FPS series in a high-powered prequel loaded with an explosive arsenal, intergalactic carnage, and perfectly timed one-liners.

IMPORTANT HEALTH WARNING ABOUT PLAYING VIDEO GAMES Photosensitive seizures A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these “photosensitive epileptic seizures” while watching video games. These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eyes or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects. Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms – children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures. The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions: sit farther from the screen, use a smaller screen, play in a well-lit room, do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued. If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202010/1202/z5tGmstkqZ5YZ8U4DvKNcpbZ.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0700-CUSA11932_00-LOA0000000000001","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"75%","Completionist":11,"genre":"Unique","id":"EP0700-CUSA11932_00-LOA0000000000001","PlusPrice":187.25,"OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/twin-mirror/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4","Popularity":"","Title":"Twin Mirror","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"DON'T NOD ENTERTAINMENT SARL","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-30","Slug":"twin-mirror-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"749.00","MainExtra":7,"SalePrice":"187.25","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"60","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"/game/88794","description":"A Tale of Paper is an emotional adventure of a paper figure who will use origami to achieve his goal.

However, instead of discovering paradise, the inhabitants of The Infinity unlocked the door to a long forgotten nightmare. Deep inside this leviathan something terrible hunts, out of myth and legend the last werewolf stalks the ship. The game centres on a prisoner desperately trying to escape the decaying ship and the clutches of the terror within. It’s a shockingly enjoyable sci-fi action running game where the player uses techniques and movements inspired by the disciplines of parkour and mixed martial arts. As well as these evasive elements there’s also combat sections in the game where a dynamic targeting system is used which calls for fast reflex combinations. Infinity Runner packs a lot into one super slick sci-fi action bundle and with it re-invents the running game genre.

Sail through storms, fight and trade, capture other people's boats or build your own, extract resources from the bottom of the ocean, reveal the secrets of the Age of Water world. Water post-apocalypse The ocean destroyed a once great civilization, but people survived and adapted. They built settlements on the roofs of tall buildings and the tops of other man-made structures. People travel across the ocean in tiny boats and huge combat vessels. The ocean provides everything they need, including extractable resources on the seabed. And yet, the dream of real land is still alive. True open world Explore the world at your own pace, discover new settlements and meet their inhabitants. Complete tasks, search for and extract valuable resources from the bottom of the ocean, earn money on trade or simply sell the artifacts you have obtained, and when you get the idea of how this world works, build your own base. Hundreds of unique ships Build boats from scratch or modify existing ones. Players have access to dozens of hulls and hundreds of parts, from which they can assemble anything ranging from a small boat to a hefty vessel 30 meters long, and then install equipment, armor and weapons. It’s important not to forget to gather a team of good crewmembers so that there is someone to stand behind machine guns and cannons or do other work on board. Fierce naval battles Pirates are always waiting for you at sea, and in some cases more aggressive players even start to chase you, so do not forget to install enough guns on your deck. You can destroy an enemy vessel, or you can capture it in battle and take it for yourself forever. Adventures might also get you into storming enemy fortresses and defending allied settlements! Personal naval base This shelter is reliably protected from enemies, and it allows a player to organize the production of everything that the captain may need on it. Build factories for the production of equipment, weapons, hulls for boats of all sizes, as well as the necessary resources. Flexible balance between PvE and PvP At first, you will only meet computer opponents, but later you can challenge other players if you are confident enough in your skills and gear. Always be on the lookout: if your task is to transport illegal goods, then other players may well take the quest to hunt smugglers. In Age of Water, everyone decides for themself who they are today - a peaceful traveler or a bloodthirsty pirate.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/2712/64a9e21da3c4db72405365f95b48edcdf4bcee5d25e206df.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4432-PPSA18593_00-0147816346325685","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action","id":"EP4432-PPSA18593_00-0147816346325685","PlusPrice":561.75,"Popularity":"","Title":"Age of Water","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Gaijin Distribution KFT","ReleaseDate":"2024-04-25","Slug":"age-of-water-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"749.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"561.75","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"0","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"","description":"Includes in-game currency (3000 Corks and 250 000 Medallions).

The methodical combat requires that you plan your attacks, dodges, blocks, and parries while considering your opponents and the environment. Death is permanent but you can improve your stats and purchase items to aid future lives. And if things get too tough then up to four local friends can grab controllers and aid the hero as player-controlled monsters, zombies, and bandits. The World Large, procedurally generated, and interconnected lands range from plains to swamps, to cities, to dungeons. These lands offer multiple paths to reach the variety of final bosses. Dungeons are a dangerous but rewarding risk. In dungeons, you will have to move slowly and be on the lookout for traps and secrets while searching for the exit. Elements interact with each other and the environment. Fire reacts to the temperature, weather, and any flammable objects, especially people. Electricity will arc towards entities and is especially dangerous around water. The chances of rain or snow adjust organically to the area’s climate and can become both a hindrance and an advantage. The shrines of multiple gods litter the land. Players can choose to pray to shrines they come across to receive a variety of favors, bonuses, and items. One must choose carefully though; every god has a different price and some become displeased when their rival is the subject of worship. Some gods may also become angered by actions the player takes while adventuring, such as destroying foliage or killing civilians. Variety Scores of weapons, items, spells, and mementos are scattered throughout the world to find. One may acquire a powerful enchanted ballista early into one life, only for the next to yield nothing more than a couple of wooden clubs. Mementos represent objects remembered from past lives and change the rules of gameplay. You may discover a memento that summons spiders from enemy corpses, improves your stats while on fire, or reverses the effects of death. There are multiple paths to victory. One could be nimble and stealthy, charge in waving a hammer, raise an army of undead, harness a variety of spells, manipulate enemies into traps or flames, amass resources to acquire the most powerful items, or simply play it safe with a sword and a shield. The various characters simply offer different starting points, every decision is your own. Challenge No life is predetermined for success. The cheery graphics disguise a brutal and unyielding experience. Unforeseen obstacles will need to be dealt with in real time and even a regular enemy will be deadly if you’re not careful. To reach the end, players will need to demonstrate that they are able to consistently overcome these obstacles. Failure can halt or even reverse progress. As you accumulate experience, discover schematics, and defeat bosses you can become permanently better prepared to tackle future challenges. The choices and advantages a player has at the beginning of a playthrough will dramatically increase as they play. New characters, items, and bonuses are unlocked in ways that are only hinted at during gameplay.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202402/2711/594d0e532892337960f060de798e952ff115296f67d9f613.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6718-PPSA21627_00-0132056813808815","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"30%","Completionist":202,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP6718-PPSA21627_00-0132056813808815","PlusPrice":230.3,"Popularity":"","Title":"In Celebration of Violence","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Dolores Entertainment S.L.","ReleaseDate":"2024-03-14","Slug":"in-celebration-of-violence-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"329.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"230.30","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"/game/123986","description":"Your favorite memory training game is back!

Enjoy challenging boss fights, flying over pitfalls, smashing through walls, knocking out enemies, and manipulating objects as you halt the alien threat once and for all. Jet Kave Adventure is a completely historically inaccurate yet highly entertaining 2.5D adventure platformer. Thaw out your inner caveman and join the skill-based action! Your name is Kave, and you’re the chief of your tribe – or rather you were until now. Banished by your own people you stumble upon… a jetpack! The device turns you into the only caveman who stands a chance against “the alien invader” – a rather unlikable guy from the sky who’ll readily kick off a disastrous volcanic eruption just so he can repair his spaceship. Begin your quest to save the whole island and prove your worth to the tribe! FEATURES: Master the jet-fueled platforming It won’t be easy with your clumsy caveman’s movements but try and do your best! Jetpack through 36 colorful levels Roam the amazing side-scrolling landscapes riddled with hazards and rich with secrets. Smack and whack 30 types of enemies Fight a variety of prehistoric beasts and bosses using your trusty bone club. Experience breakneck flight sequences and boss fights Soar across pitfalls, smash through rocky walls, and defeat the most terrific enemies using your continuously improving skills. Challenge yourself in ARCADE MODE Try the exciting arcade-like experience, where you have a limited number of lives, and getting to the checkpoint no longer replenishes your health. Plus, extra lives can be bought only between levels so if you lose them all, it means a good ol’ Game Over. It’s tough but fair. Reach the top of the leaderboard Take part in Time, Collectible, and No Damage Challenges, and compete against other players to get the best possible high score in online rankings. Find collectibles and upgrade your gear Return to the time when seashells were the only currency and collect as many of them to enhance your strength.

You play as Airhead, a small Body and the round inflated organism it uses as a Head. And while Head is slowly but surely deflating, you have a chance to save its life. To do so, you must use air tanks to keep Head inflated while you explore Airhead’s metroidvania-style world, searching for amazing abilities and upgrades that will unlock new areas and puzzles for you to overcome. On your adventure, it will be up to you to uncover the true connection between Head, the air tanks, and the technology that litters the world, so you can save Head no matter the cost. EXPLORATION Finding your way through Airheads world is not always easy. You must brave dark caverns, ancient structures, and other mysterious locations in order to save Head. Along the way you will find new abilities, unlocking new areas and puzzles, and if you go even farther afield, who knows what you will find in the hidden corners of the world.

Reveal who is the fastest and most agile jumping ball among you! The key is mastering your reflexes and looking ahead. To guide the bouncing ball, rotate the platforms to align the ball with the cracks. Do this in quick succession for a combo move and higher points.

The players will have to crack some grim criminal cases by exploring the world around them, rediscover the mysterious identity of the protagonist, cross the borders of inherent dangers and formal logic and create their own vision of time and history. BECOME A MYSTERY HUNTER A true hunter always trusts their gut instincts. They see moments of doubt as a waste of time as the path to the truth lies clear before their mind’s eye. It’s an intricate network of barely visible strings and links between other people’s secrets, mysteries and motives… You just have to pull the right string which will lead you to the solution. Become a hunter whose primary weapons are his mind and heart. COMPOSE YOUR VISION OF THE WORLD FROM BITS OF INFORMATION The main feature of this game is the unusual mix of sci-fi, social fiction, detective and horror. Each genre presents a unique story; the players may freely combine fragments of information from them all to create their own versions of this world, its history and the causes of main events. The identity of the protagonist is a mystery itself, and you’ll have to approach the storyline like a puzzle to solve it. FOLLOW THE STORIES OF THOSE WHO GOT LOST IN THIS LABYRINTH BEFORE Each and every person who had passed through this world before the protagonist came had their own vision of what was going on. Each and every one of them left some clues. The data that you’ll eventually gather might sometimes be inconsistent and controversial, but there will also be similar or even duplicate bits of valuable information. Trying to make any sense out of all this is hard, but the process itself will definitely bring you closer to the truth.

To contemplate one's life means to knock oneself down, to stop, to begin to go over one's experiences, to discard the superfluous and unnecessary, to destroy the old in the hope of constructing the new, in other words, to be undermined. It is impossible not to note the severity of this word because this action is associated with pain, loss, the need to choose difficult routes, and sometimes taking risks so as not to make new mistakes and not to fall off the set path. But is it worth enduring the pain? What happens if we simply go with the flow? How will our lives turn out then? The French philosopher Albert Camus asked similar questions in his famous essay \"The Myth of Sisyphus. In brief, the ancient Greek myth is as follows: the gods condemned Sisyphus, because he was too arrogant and too dodgy, to roll a huge stone up the mountain, which kept falling and had to start all over again. It would seem that what could be worse than this useless work? What was Sisyphus thinking as he climbed to the top of the mountain? And what do we care about him? Maybe we should admit that our lives are a bit like this Sisyphus? Approach Albert Camus's thoughts and feelings, his philosophy. Perhaps you will find some answers to these difficult questions. • Explore the world around you and find philosophical notes. • Take the stone to the top, higher and higher, and if it falls, well, start over, that's your punishment. • Choose your path correctly. Your decisions will determine the end of the game. • Discover the philosophy of Albert Camus. Don't try to understand every word, just let it pass through you. • Enjoy the abstract game world, and find different ways of passing. • And also listen to atmospheric music and sound effects.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202309/1720/2ec7923b93669974f8483c69eb15b79f726c80c93b2ed5f8.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2029-CUSA44262_00-0936199158514762","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":2,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP2029-CUSA44262_00-0936199158514762","PlusPrice":62.25,"Popularity":"","Title":"Heavy Burden","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Whale Rock Games OOO","ReleaseDate":"2024-01-23","Slug":"heavy-burden-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"249.00","MainExtra":1,"SalePrice":"74.70","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"","description":"Fight in online multiplayer battles with up to 64 players in this remastered classic!

The great grandpappy of adventure games will test you and tickle your problem-solving skills as you unearth its plot and secrets. Through cunning trial-and-error you will crawl through tight squeezes, encounter impressive caverns, collect inventory, locate treasure, thwart dwarf attacks, all while keeping your eye on the score before your lamp goes out. Dust off your vintage Colossal Cave maps from the 70s, they'll still work like a charm. This is a faithful tribute to the original game design. Developed in the mid-1970’s by amateur cave spelunker, this classic text-adventure was originally crafted as a way for a father to entertain his two young daughters. Will Crowther based his design on detailed cave maps he’d made with his wife, Patricia, of the Bedquilt section of Kentucky’s Mammoth cave. Family cave exploration is at the heart of this game. Shortly thereafter, the code-prankster, Don Woods, discovered the game on the ARPANET and expanded the cave. He layered in more fun, fantasy, puzzles, and a vexing 350-point system. Years later, Don’s expansion became the most accessible and the definitive version of Colossal Cave Adventure. Enter Roberta Williams. She first played the game in 1979 and was instantly hooked. She spent weeks playing, taking notes and mapping out the cave, as it was revealed through the textual descriptions in game. Her mind filled with imaginary neon mushrooms, misty underground lakes, a snappy bivalve mollusk, and a noticeably absent giant. After achieving all 350 points, she was ready for another adventure – a dilemma in 1979. If it was another adventure she wanted, she’d have to make her own... In 1980 she designed and developed the world’s first graphic computer game, Mystery House. This groundbreaking game is considered one of the most influential in history, establishing conventions that have become standard in the adventure genre. It has been ported to just about every computer and console, played by millions, and inspired many other games, books, movies, and TV series. Relive the golden age of adventure gaming. Immerse yourself in a timeless, sprawling cave system filled with treasures, creatures, and brain-teasing puzzles. Transport back to a more innocent time. Experience the retro-cool of yesteryear's gaming mechanics, accompanied by an art style that harkens back to the golden age of adventure games. This lovingly assembled tribute is brought to you by boutique studio, Cygnus Entertainment. Ken and Roberta Williams are committed to sharing and preserving the spirit of classic adventure games. With its challenging and mind-bending puzzles, this explorative game will keep you enthralled. Explore 14 distinct regions filled with magic, hidden secrets, breathtaking views, and cave-dwelling creatures. Each area offers a unique and enchanting experience.

In this treacherous yet tropically beautiful haven, he discovers an artifact of immense power. Upon realizing the true potential of the artifact, he embarks on a journey filled with challenges and hardships to unlock its full might. The island holds numerous perilous dungeons, some inhabited by ancient and terrifying bosses, while others house more misunderstood and talkative ones. To enhance his chances of conquering the island's challenges, our hero will acquire new skills, catch fish, cook nutritious meals, discover valuable treasures, and seek blessings from the many deities at the island's shrines. Many charming inhabitants reside on the island. Among them are merchants who are open to trade with our hero, while others will send him on adventurous quests, offering him handsome rewards in return. STORYTELLING: The game focuses on \"Humor and Fun\" in its story and character dialogues, as well as many popular references. Throughout the island, the protagonist will encounter many characters, including deities. Additionally, there are numerous lore-books that add depth and explain the broader world beyond the island. CHARACTER: Mogren is a resilient and fearless Orc. His journey through Thunder Island will introduce him to numerous challenges, and to overcome them, he must level up, learn skills, unlock new abilities, receive blessings, and eat the right food at the right time. DUNGEONS: Each dungeon has its own theme and a set of unique puzzles. For example, in one of them, you have to transform into a specific creature and play the entire dungeon in that form. The side dungeons, also known as \"Caves\", feature their own puzzles and encounters, providing players with a wide range of content variations. QUESTING: The main Questline sends the player on a journey to discover all of Thunder Island, Along the way, Mogren will encounter many inhabitants who require his assistance with various tasks. Mogren will happily, and sometimes begrudgingly, aid these individuals and receive generous amounts of XP and quest rewards in return. COLLECTING: The game also features a Collect-a-thon aspect, with cosmetic hats that add style and a sense of fashion to the character. The OST can be listened to in-game, but first the individual soundtracks must be found. And last but not least, there are the \"Crystal Clams\", which I will not spoil here.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202310/2517/778facb535312724534cbde64b00cba4cb73782f72fa3cb1.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5154-CUSA45949_00-0739752124365077","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"60%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP5154-CUSA45949_00-0739752124365077","PlusPrice":99.6,"Popularity":"","Title":"Shalnor Legends 2: Trials of Thunder","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Johnny Ostad","ReleaseDate":"2023-11-09","Slug":"shalnor-legends-2-trials-of-thunder-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"249.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"99.60","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"","description":"This game is very simple.

Plunge into an abandoned space station alone or with friends in co-op, recruit a team of shipwrecked heroes, and protect your crystal against never-ending waves of monsters... or die trying, get reloaded, and try again. WE GOT TURRETS AND WE GOT GUNS You're stranded on an abandoned space station chock-full of monsters and mysteries. To get out you'll have to reach The Core, but you can't do that without your crystal bot. That scuttling critter is your key to surviving the procedurally generated rooms of this space ruin. Sadly, it's also a fragile soul, and every monster in the place wants a piece of it. You're going to have to think quick, plan well, place your turrets, and then... fireworks! Bugs, bots and blobs will stop at nothing to turn you and that crystal into dust and debris. With a large choice of weapons and turrets, the right gear will be the difference between life and death. RIDE SOLO OR GIDDY UP WITH FRIENDS You can face the horrors of the Station riding solo, or squad up and run the gauntlet in 3 player co-op. Once you've got your posse, plan your moves. Pick their weapons from a wide choice ranging from flamethrowers to poison snipers. When you're set, enter the Station to take on a character's quest, take a stab at escaping, or just go loco on the locals. You'll likely die trying, but hey, that's the way it goes in this space dungeon! ASSEMBLE YOUR RECKLESS SQUAD Prepare to meet a cast of colorful heroes all gunning for the same goal: to get the hell out! Each brings their own cards to the table. There's tanky Bunker who'll soak up damage, fiery Blaze who loves to blow stuff up, or maybe Shroom who'll heal her squadmates with her \"unusual\" incense. Select your heroes to build the team that works for you. As you get to know them, you'll learn that they all have their own particular motivations and secrets... MONSTERS, DANGERS, SECRETS AND TREASURES, OH MY! Escaping means overcoming all the dangers of the Station. Yup, all of them. Deadly robots, merciless monsters, loot, and giant beasts await you at every corner. The deeper you delve into this scrap heap, the more you'll discover its tragic history. Why does the Station reel in any ship that flies too close? Why do you come back every time you kick the bucket? No matter how familiar you are with the ENDLESSâ„¢ Universe, the Station has more stories to tell. THE MORE DYIN', THE MORE GROWIN' Hate to break it to you, this won't be easy and you might die… a lot. But that's okay, because every time you do, you get reloaded back into the Saloon. Think of it as your center of operations (and beverages), where you can upgrade your heroes and weapons, unlock new paths to The Core, chat with the locals, listen to tunes, and drink boosting (and delicious) libations. Then, jump back into the Station and try to get out -- again.

Tackle challenging encounters with your party of two characters, using a variety of skills and highly interactive environments. Maybe you'll light an enemy on fire and kick them into a grain field for a proper barbeque, or set up a trap and fell a tree on top of them. The options are endless, and you're the one in charge! You have control over time The core of Iron Danger is its unique time control mechanic. You can rewind time up to 5 seconds whenever you want, trying different strategies and combinations of moves until you find the right one for the task at hand. The time manipulation allows us to combine real-time combat gameplay with controls from more traditional, tactical turn-based combat games. This gives tactical combat a puzzle-like element, as you can keep trying new approaches to turn impossible odds to your advantage and synchronize the actions of your characters for the perfect outcome. You will die, but you will not fail! Iron Danger is set in a world of lofty fells, primeval forest, and placid lakes...as well as living gods and monsters of steel. The city of Kalevala, home of the humans who rebelled against the gods and forsook their protection, shines in the middle of this world, surrounded by towns, sea lanes and woodlands under its protection. But from the frozen north, a witch queen is leading her army on a quest for vengeance against the lords of Kalevala. Ancient ruins from the days when gods dwelled on the earth are opening to unleash forgotten powers, tempting humans and striving to overtake the world. You’ll take on the role of Kipuna, a sharp-witted village girl, who becomes imbued with an ancient power that grants dominion over time and death. You must use your wits to control it as you’re drawn into a war between the city of Kalevala and the armies of the Northlanders driven by their witch queen Lowhee. Your task is to master the power, in order to use it for mankind’s protection, while your enemies seek to harness it in the service of total destruction.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/2114/58030e86a07917a7b43b63059fa93780a7b7c79e428eb767.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8923-PPSA12357_00-IRONDANGEREU0000","MainStory":12,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"90%","Completionist":15,"genre":"Role-Playing","id":"EP8923-PPSA12357_00-IRONDANGEREU0000","PlusPrice":49.9,"Popularity":"","Title":"Iron Danger","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Daedalic Entertainment GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2023-08-16","Slug":"iron-danger-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"499.00","MainExtra":15,"SalePrice":"49.90","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"/game/142942","description":"Duck Race is an adrenaline-fueled racing game where players enter the whimsical world of competitive rubber duck racing.

The gameplay combines many different types of puzzles from more and less famous puzzle games and takes them to a whole new perspective. After the recent war, engineers from Epsilon Energy created the Split indestructible shield system. It was to protect individual giant cities covering almost the entire planet from armed conflicts. Different cities have different policies for their citizens. In West Ulrage, every citizen gets a guardian robot at birth. In Hal'Tor, pairs of robots raise several children each. Whereas in Dievez, people are raised in large centers. Most jobs have been taken over by machines. People work mainly as mechanics, programmers, or operators. The Split control panel is riddled with numerous traps that will require both good reflexes and composure. You can try to destroy enemies or escape from them by using time manipulation and your own clones to distract them. The game's design refers to Brutalism, an architectural style popular around the 1970s. It was promoted, among others, by the game \"Control\". We mixed this style with the digital environment from \"Tron: Legacy\". The levels are full of nooks and crannies, which may seem empty at first glance, but lead to interesting places. We were inspired by games such as: Q.U.B.E.2”, “The Talos Principle”, “The Turing Test”, “Portal”, “The Witness” and “Antichamber”","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202306/0613/98eb73faf8779ccb18896083254a3c26bf0721a46b13204c.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8571-CUSA43172_00-0086476054437186","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":4,"genre":"Action, Puzzle","id":"EP8571-CUSA43172_00-0086476054437186","PlusPrice":124.5,"Popularity":"","Title":"Split","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FreeMind S.A.","ReleaseDate":"2023-07-07","Slug":"split-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"249.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"149.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"/game/94583","description":"This product entitles you to download both the digital PS4â„¢ version and the digital PS5â„¢ version of this game.

Get a babysitter for the kids, this game is a madcap, mile-a-minute spree of spies, dives, and gun-toting bad guys that will have you on the edge of your seat. You take on the role of Jack, a handsome, jaded former intelligence officer pulled out of his retired life as a strip club regular for one last mission to stop the villainous virologist Krueger, who plans to unleash a mind-controlling virus on the unsuspecting citizens of L.A. Everyone is out to kill Jack now that he’s hot on Krueger’s trail, and he’ll need to use his mind, muscles, and mojo to stay alive long enough to stop Kruger’s plot. Your spur-of-the-moment decisions will help or hinder Jack as he tries to find and protect the only scientist who has the cure to counter Krueger’s deadly bioweapon. A restoration and remaster of a game lost to time for over 25 years, American Hero was originally designed for the Atari Jaguar CD as a “playable movie” with a groundbreaking, more fluid presentation than the FMV games of its time. The game features the talents of professional actors, including Timothy Bottoms (The Last Picture Show, Johnny Got His Gun), Daniel Roebuck (The Fugitive, Final Destination), and Musetta Vander (O Brother, Where Art Thou, Wild Wild West). For this restoration, Timothy Bottoms reprises his role in newly recorded voiceovers of Jack’s inner thoughts heard throughout the game. This restoration was rebuilt from the ground up with new game logic that delivers on the ambitious promise of the original game. This edition of the game includes new voicework from star Timothy Bottoms to accompany the original footage, completing the American Hero experience for the first time. American Hero features: • An explosive and adult-oriented Hollywood production with intense action, spicy encounters, and gut-busting laughs • A winding player-directed plot with multiple paths and endings • A unique FMV format that plays smoothly like watching a film • The return of Hollywood actor Timothy Bottoms as Jack with newly recorded voiceover","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/2203/ejzKp9VIndGcgNyCzJyu60bv.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6260-PPSA09302_00-9439955969514772","MainStory":2,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Action, Unique","id":"EP6260-PPSA09302_00-9439955969514772","PlusPrice":303.2,"Popularity":"","Title":"American Hero","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Ziggurat Interactive, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2023-07-04","Slug":"american-hero-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"379.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"303.20","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"","description":"The Ultimate Edition includes: • NARUTO TO BORUTO: SHINOBI STRIKER (full game) • Season Pass 1 • Season Pass 2 • Season Pass 3 • Season Pass 4 The Naruto franchise is back with a brand new experience in NARUTO TO BORUTO: SHINOBI STRIKER!

Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose… How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring â„¢, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dÃ»r and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself… or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn't break; he bends, he adapts… Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It's up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0314/3bfea22d60d10ee2ba3ab64ffbfe95a53ee9a133d0fcc77e.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG0000000000000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4","PS5"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Adventure","id":"EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG0000000000000","PlusPrice":999999,"Popularity":"","Title":"The Lord of the Rings: Gollumâ„¢","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2023-05-25","Slug":"the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":1,"Price":"1499.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"299.80","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"1990-01-01","LowestPrice":"/game/54154","description":"","SaleStarted":"1989-12-17","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/0407/59a37fafd7da789abb05e4f8006dce25b50654246473ecef.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3656-CUSA42927_00-0718540123996392","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"80%","Completionist":3,"genre":"","id":"EP3656-CUSA42927_00-0718540123996392","PlusPrice":49.8,"Popularity":"","Title":"Chef","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01","Slug":"chef-ps5","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"249.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"49.80","IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"","description":"Super Kids Racing : Lava Edition offers wide variety of challenges with many different types of vehicles to choose from.

Use the voices you hear to return to crime scenes, tracking down each individual involved and solving the cases. But where do the voices come from? Can you trust what you hear? And what's the mysterious thread weaving all of these cases together? A Unique Case-Solving Experience Discover the truth hidden in the voices from the past. Step through time as you use our device to eavesdrop on conversations from past crime scenes. Every clue, every move, and every motive will be presented in the form of audio. Rather than controlling any one character, you only need listen to their conversations, following along as the story evolves. Use the information you hear to match names to voices and determine how everything (and everyone) is related. Can you discover the truth? Open-Ended Narrative Mystery Game Explore the story and piece together the puzzle in your own way! Don't expect to be \"fed\" a pile of clues. Rather, take the role of a fly on the wall, observing and listening to the events as they unfold. Anyone could be the culprit; key clues may be revealed at any second; any character's storyline may cross paths with another at any point in time. YOU be the editor—the order of the story is up to you!","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202209/2202/0VlGMlUQJNTiVRUcI30EIA7P.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6804-CUSA37443_00-UNHEARD000000000","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Unique","id":"EP6804-CUSA37443_00-UNHEARD000000000","PlusPrice":149.4,"Popularity":"","Title":"Unheard – Voices of Crime Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"505 GAMES S.R.L.","ReleaseDate":"2023-03-21","Slug":"unheard-voices-of-crime-edition-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"249.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"149.40","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"/game/71441","description":"Several years have passed since the events that devastated the once proud town remembered as Paradise.

You have to perform increasingly complex tasks in prison, balancing the administration's assessment and inmates' satisfaction. In the game, you play the role of a prison guard and it is only up to you whether you decide to obey the law or let this place and people corrupt you completely. After all, who said you had to be an exemplary ranger? Maybe you prefer to trade with prisoners, help them smuggle, and bet on the outcome of fights in prison instead? After all, everyone likes to have fun sometimes. Especially in a sad place like this, where you are also the boss. Or at least you think so. So how? Will you choose to follow the rules, intercept contraband, count prisoners, send them to work, take care of their basic needs and keep prison gangs under control? Will you go to the dark side? Whatever you decide, remember that your actions will affect both the facility itself and the inmates, and above all, the further course of your career. Unique features of the game: - try to balance between following the orders of your superiors and doing small favors for the inmates. In doing so, you will maintain a fragile balance between both and benefit from the gratitude of both parties, - become the exemplary prison guard in campaign mode. Receive new prisoners, search cells for contraband for confiscation, view surveillance footage, maintain peace and order, react to inmates' acts of disobedience, and complete many other tasks assigned by your superiors, - or ignore all rules in Free Play mode. Do what you want, discover the farthest corners of the prison, explore the surroundings and interact with prisoners. Just remember that your every action will have an impact not only on other prison guards but also on the inmates themselves.

The Harpy Queen helped the Gnome Queen and the whole crew reach their land and they've been the best of friends since then. They don't see each other often, but regularly write to each other. These are usually friendly letters about fun celebrations in their kingdoms, the first snow, a nephew's birthday or the building of a new city. However, this letter was completely different to the ones before. The messenger that delivered it was scruffy and out of breath and this was something the Gnome Queen found strange. \"\"What happened?\"\" the Queen asked. \"\"Your cloak is torn and your face is scratched up as if you ran through thick thorn bushes.\"\" \"\"That's exactly what happened, Your Majesty,\"\" the messenger replied. \"\"What for?\"\" the Queen asked in surprise. \"\"Caravans and messengers haven't used that road for ages. No one actually uses that road. We have an excellent road going around it.\"\" \"\"It would take a lot more time to go around.\"\" \"\"What's the hurry?\"\" \"\"Well, this isn't just a letter, Your Majesty.

It's a high score shooter in which each loop increases the speed and difficulty! A game in two parts: First, brave your way through a confusing maze of menus, then take to the air as the indefatigable \"Hoodie Girl\" and blast sentient advertisements into cold, hard cash! ==== WAIT, WHAT IS THIS? ==== Okay, so the actual shoot-em up plays like this: It's an infinitely looping, high score game, with multiple game modes. This is not a regular shooter, the level structure is not like Ikaruga or Dodonpachi or most shmups. Each of the 3 game modes has *one level*, but it keeps changing with each loop. The crazy part is, every time you beat the level, the *speed of the game* increases. It gets quite challenging by loop 5, and incredibly difficulty by loop 8. To help out, there's a powerup called 'Time Pulse', in limited quantity. It slows down time temporarily, and if you shoot the enemy bullets during this time, you zap them into cash. And for every so-many bullets you destroy like this, you get a new Time Pulse! It's good to get you out of a jam, and man does it get tough later on. Once you understand the flow of the loops, you'll know when the best time to spend your Time Pulse, and you'll start to figure out how to chain them, earn more, to get further. The \"Surprise\" game mode is like a \"rogue-like\" in which the level layout changes every time you play. This mode also has lots of powerups available, making it exciting to keep trying it. Features • Loop-tastic speed insanity! Every time you beat a level, the game speed increases! • Time Pulse gameplay -- Slow down time and turn enemy bullets into score drops! • 2-Player local co-op for extra firepower, and extra Parkour! • 3 Game modes: \"Standard\", \"Parkour Remix\", and \"Surprise!\" • Surprise Game mode features new level layouts every time you play. • Online Leaderboard!

Defend your city as five unique and devastating Kaiju grow in power with every attack. Unfortunately, they can't be killed, but can be slowed down and forced to fall back... for now. Monsters move towards the nearest building, and the scientists have mathed the exact odds of where they might go next. Build sacrificial army bases and airfields to distract the Kaiju. If standard methods aren't enough, deploy experimental weapons such as freeze rays and transforming mechas to keep them at bay. Or you can always park tanks and jets in the monsters’ path to slow them down (don't worry, we have a good insurance policy). If all your efforts fail, don't be ashamed and run away! Be prepared to evacuate the laboratory using transport trucks, boats, or planes when the Kaiju get too close. Play missions from all over the world as you progress through the fight against Kaiju in a 15+ hour story-based campaign. Throughout the campaign, you’ll have the chance to gain an advantage with upgradeable ACE units and Project Deck customization. Test your wits in tactical puzzles, command dozens of units in large-scale scenarios, and fend off repeated attacks in defense missions while developing your city economically. And if you’re hungry for more, test your command skills in weekly challenges! Features: Protect your city in a tactical battle with cannon-fodder tanks, jets, and more... unusual firepower. Face five different Kaiju - each with unique skills and potential for mutation. Immersive gameplay - enjoy the narrative-driven gameplay with a plethora of dialogues between historical characters throughout each operation.

You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip.

Milky Way Prince is a semi-autobiographical story entirely designed, programmed, illustrated, and scored by a young author, Lorenzo Redaelli. \"During my experience with a borderline partner, I thought that falling in love with him was like becoming part of a binary star system.

With departures, arrivals and the continuous hustle and bustle of passengers, there is rarely an opportunity for a break. In Airport Simulator: Day & Night, your challenge is to keep the wheel turning and ensure that everything in the airport runs smoothly around the clock. Firstly, you will need to take care of fleet and baggage management to handle transporting passengers and the ever-increasing number of aircraft from various airlines. In addition, security checks, airport hygiene and maintenance are also crucial and need to be well managed. Depending on the time of day and weather conditions, your tasks will vary. For example, in frosty weather, the de-icing of wings becomes the main focus of attention. These are just some of the important parts of running your organization as you compete against other international airport competitors. Goal-oriented management, satisfied staff, and happy passengers - will you achieve your goals through hard work and commitment? In the beginning, you will take over many tasks yourself. Over time, you will be able to delegate tasks to your airport staff. For now, it is time to roll up your sleeves; in Airport Simulator: Day & Night, there is always something to do! Day & Night: Manage your airport at any time of the day and make sure everything runs smoothly. Changing weather: Safety comes first, and processes need to be followed in any weather condition. E.g. Taking care of de-icing wings. Managing the plane: Different types of aircraft all require inspection and cleaning of the interior. Busy traffic: Numerous detailed vehicles and aircraft on the huge grounds guarantees a realistic airport experience. Different vehicles can be steered by yourself. Intelligent AI and personnel system: Pilots, stewardesses, mechanics, taxiway staff all support you in your tasks. A good organization and overview are the key to success. Varied missions: Tasks such as de-icing, loading and unloading the aircraft, refuelling, transport and cleaning are just some of your extensive activities. Realism: Every action requires a reaction. Damage to vehicles or sick employees - everything is simulated.","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/0308/IVM9kIxUBZuoNwpeWE6f1DoI.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP8935-CUSA29671_00-AIRPORTDAYPS4EU0","MainStory":0,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Simulation","id":"EP8935-CUSA29671_00-AIRPORTDAYPS4EU0","PlusPrice":187.25,"Popularity":"","Title":"Airport Simulator: Day & Night","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"UNITED INDEPENDENT ENTERTAINMENT GMBH","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-18","Slug":"airport-simulator-day-night-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"749.00","MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":"224.70","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"","description":"The Guy is back in VR!

The main goal is to clear all the floors of the Dark Tower and defeat the main antagonist - the Evil Mage. This won’t be easy because after the permadeath of the main character the castle floor plan is automatically redesigned. Whether you succeed or not primarily depends on your skills, not on random events. The player gradually gets to know game mechanics, learns the effects of artifacts, items, skills, the behavior of enemies and bosses. This lies at the core of gameplay - the player gets better mainly by learning from their mistakes and improving their skills, not from leveling up their character. Plot The story starts with a young man who fell in love with the King’s daughter and dared to go and ask the ruler for his daughter’s hand. But a commoner is no match for her, so the King sends for the executioner to have him beheaded. At this very moment, the Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the villain's lair to defeat him and prove he is worthy of the King’s blessing. The castle halls diverge at certain points, which means the player will have to make important choices. The game has several endings which depend on how many times you complete it and the paths you choose. • The main gameplay feature is fun! No farming or hardcore difficulty. As you progress, you'll come across Easter eggs, things that’ll crack you up and allusions to other games coupled with self-mockery • Randomly generated locations of items, artifacts, traps, rooms in the building, enemies and bosses • 12 characters, all with different performance and equipment • Customized equipment which can be upgraded with rocks, runes and enchantments • Secret features and tricks (e.g. get a firesword by plunging your sword into the lava) • Jaw-dropping action with various moves, skills and spells!","SaleStarted":"2024-06-04","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202110/1314/p9Xoj3zDWsHsxVd3qyJsR5SE.png?w=200","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP5506-CUSA29830_00-PLPA000000000000","MainStory":5,"platform":"Playstation","platforms":["PS4"],"Trailer":"","PercentOff":"69%","Completionist":17,"genre":"Role Playing Games, Action","id":"EP5506-CUSA29830_00-PLPA000000000000","PlusPrice":17.92,"Popularity":"","Title":"Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"BIG WAY LLC","ReleaseDate":"2021-10-26","Slug":"princesslootpixelagain-ps4","NumberofPlayers":"https://shope.ee/5ALD8alAHo","IsPS5":0,"Price":"112.00","MainExtra":6,"SalePrice":"34.72","IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2024-06-19","LowestPrice":"/game/83091","description":"MAINFRAME DEFENDERS - tactical retrofuturistic strategy game. A computer virus has infiltrated the \"Stargazer\" research complex. Most of the robotic units are controlled by the virus. Lead a squad of 4 prototypes on a mission to defend complex mainframe. You'll have to repel assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and do more on your way to the deepest parts of the complex. Work with item limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and return fire.

Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies.

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environment conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You’re the only human there, after all. SURVIVAL Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game – including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants, and research facilities to complete this mission. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts, in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using the rift technology. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreakerâ„¢’s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings.

But as more victims pile up and Yagami unravels the truth, will the scales of justice tip in favor of defending the law or enacting vengeance? From the studio that brought you the Yakuza series, Lost Judgment weaves elements of investigative sleuthing, noir narrative and action combat into one mystery thriller. Take your detective expertise to the streets of Japan and defend those that the law fails to protect. INVESTIGATIVE ACTION Tap into Yagami’s arsenal of private eye tricks to gather clues. From hi-tech gadgets including drones and social media listening devices to hardboiled gumshoe methods like scaling buildings and tracking suspects in the city. No stronger evidence than catching a suspect in the act. FREEFORM COMBAT Master Yagami’s three unique, combo-heavy martial arts styles to overcome any situation from group ambushes to single-target takedowns.

Even if you fail a quest, your dear character will survive and retain their gear, losing only the stat boosts and special skills unlocked on the last journey into the Abyss Tower. Leave no corner unsearched as you jump, roll and leap off walls! Open chests to acquire swords, spears and staffs that can be set as primary or secondary weapons.

Glittering Sword is full with the spiritual references to these classical gaming brands, and it’s shiny and balanced graphical setting helps the player to dive into the memorable adventure. Best way to describe this game by phrase: Â«fantasy adventure set in a cozy world with Sokoban-style puzzlesÂ». Here, each screen is the individual location with traps, enemies, portals and switches, and the player needs to learn the exact order of completing things the right way. The more you play Glittering Sword, the harder it gets with traps being more and more deadly, and the enemies become tougher.

Race perpetually on exquisitely detailed stages, full of light-speed danger, chaos and mayhem. Challenge your friends in the fiercely competitive multiplayer modes, either online or in split-screen mode. Sabotage your fellow racers by activating hover mines, creating a rockslide to cause tunnels to collapse, firing missiles from rocket launchers along the track, and many more malicious tricks.
