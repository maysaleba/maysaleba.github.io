YOUR SCHEDULE.<br /><br />Whether in the industrial or harbour zone, downtown, in the surrounding villages or the business park, in Bus Simulator, you experience up-close the exciting everyday life of a bus driver in a vast and freely drivable urban area. Get behind the wheel of your 8 original licensed city buses from the great brands of Mercedes-Benz, Setra, MAN, and IVECO and transport your passengers safely and punctually to their destinations, either solo in single player mode, or with friends in real-time multiplayer mode.<br /><br />As a bus driver in the 12 different districts, you'll face the challenges of the traffic in a big city and everything that entails. Don't be deterred by freak weather conditions, potholes, traffic jams, fare evaders, accidents, construction sites, night driving and specific passenger requests. On the contrary, take full control of your bus, earn money, gain a good reputation owing to your safe and punctual driving style and enjoy almost limitless driving pleasure in the authentic urban locations. Use the thousands of miles of virtual roads and streets to gain new districts, new buses and new customisation options.<br /><br />But drive carefully with the buses you build! Don't cause any damage or accidents and watch out for the speed cameras located around the city, or it could have a negative effect on your reputation, not to mention your wallet.<br /><br />So, what are you waiting for? Your shift has already started!<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Play as Deacon St. John, a drifter and bounty hunter who rides the broken road, fighting to survive while searching for a reason to live. <br />\u2022Harsh Open World: Using the power of PlayStation4 and Unreal Engine 4, Days Gone offers an incredibly realistic and detailed open-world experience. Immerse yourself in vast and hostile environments, and explore their secrets. Search abandoned vehicles, houses, truck stops and towns as you scavenge for resources. But be careful\u2014 day and night cycles, along with dynamic weather systems, all affect gameplay and enemy behavior. <br />\u2022Brutal Sandbox Combat: Perfect your gameplay with an endless combination of strategy and play in every situation. Craft customized items using pieces and parts found in the field, from brutal melee weapons to traps and more. Act wisely, as every choice can be the difference between life and death.<br />\u2022Unique Enemies: In addition to human drifters, marauders and militia, Deacon must face a wilderness overrun by Freakers\u2014 mindless, feral creatures. Although more animal than human, Freakers are smart and quickly evolving. As with any living creature, they have needs, habits, and behaviors that Deacon must learn and adjust to. <br />\u2022Unique Setting: Adapt to quick environmental changes inspired by the harsh high-desert of the Pacific Northwest. One minute, Deacon is riding through a dense alpine forest\u2014or snow field or lush meadow\u2014 and the next, he's fighting his way through harsh desert lava fields and caves. Ancient lava flows scar and define the hazardous environments, delivering a breathtaking and diverse backdrop of regions to explore. From small towns and mountains to cliffs and river basins, explore the beautiful but threatening world, left in the wake of humanity's destruction.<br />\u2022Compelling Story: At its core, Days Gone is about survivors and what makes them human: desperation, loss, madness, betrayal, friendship, brotherhood, regret, love\u2014 and hope. It's about how, even when confronted with such enormous tragedy, hope never dies.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.<br />  WARNING: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS MATERIAL WHICH MAY OFFEND AND MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED, CIRCULATED, SOLD, HIRED, GIVEN, LENT, SHOWN, PLAYED OR PROJECTED TO A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS",

Immortal but crippled, your last resort is to take over bodies in order to move, explore\u2026 and fight.<br /><br />While you may well be immortal, the corpses you possess are not. Each time your host is destroyed, you will be sent back to the dungeon to find yourself a new one and start again...<br /><br />Experience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath. No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs new paths you've unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.<br /><br />Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble make for a visceral and cathartic action game.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who've faced its trials and tribulations before can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance.<br /><br />In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant, channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One. <br />With the summoning of The Old One, a colourless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them lost their minds \u2014 left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained.<br /><br />Now, Boletaria is cut off from the outside world, and the knights who dare penetrate the deep fog to free the land from its plight are never seen again. As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title \"Slayer of Demons\" and send The Old One back to its slumber.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Climb Dharma Tower, humanity's last shelter, after a world-ending cataclysm. Make your way up from the bottom to the top, confront the tyrannical Keymaster, and take your revenge.<br /><br />The streets of this tower city are full of violence. Mara the Keymaster rules with an iron fist and little regard for human life.<br /><br />As resources diminish, the strong prey on the weak and chaos threatens to consume what little order remains. The decisive last stand is coming. A final attempt to set things right before mankind goes over the edge of extinction.<br /><br />As the most advanced blade fighter ever created, you're always outnumbered but never outclassed.

It tells the story of a world that has already ended and its inhabitants who fight to survive.<br /><br />Ghostrunner has full audio available in English , and interface available in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish (Spain and Latin American), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Japanese\"<br /><br />Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console",

        "Desc": "Going Under is a satirical dungeon crawler about exploring the cursed ruins of failed tech startups. As an unpaid intern in the dystopian city of Neo-Cascadia, you'll wield office junk as weaponry as you make your way through the offbeat procedural dungeons beneath your company campus.<br /><br />[The Future is Wack]<br />Failed businesses no longer just cease to exist--they sink beneath the earth, and their employees are cursed to wander the halls for eternity as monsters. It's your duty to put these monsters out of their misery and repossess their assets--so that your boss can afford a new car, or something.<br /><br />[Not All Heroes Get Paychecks]<br />Battle through the remains of failed startups themed off of gig workers, dating sites, and cryptocurrency. Uncover the true motives of your employer, a carbonated drink startup known as Fizzle, and their parent company, a subscription box manufacturer with an army of helpful shipping drones. Make friends with your co-workers! Hire a freelance goblin! Date a slime! Invest in crypto! Set a rideshare on fire!<br /><br />[Fight Flexibly]<br />In the dungeons of Going Under, almost everything can be used as a weapon, from laptops to brooms to body pillows. Proper weapons can be found as well, but even they can break at a moment's notice if you aren't careful. Playing cautiously and picking the right weapon for the situation are musts if you intend on surviving your internship.<br /><br />[Horrible Bosses]<br />And you thought your boss was a monster. At the bottom of the dungeons lurk the founders of the cursed startups, getting rich off of investments while their employees fight amongst themselves. Defeat them and return to the surface with their enchanted relics to empower the company you work for.<br /><br />[Get Paid in Experience]<br />As you explore, you'll encounter powerful Skills that change the way you play. Learn them at the Cafe and they'll show up in future runs. Use a Skill often enough, and you'll get it \u201cendorsed\u201d and available to start your expeditions with. Combine multiple Skills for crazy synergies, and you'll be cleaning house in no time.<br /><br />[A World of Characters]<br />Complete Tasks for your co-workers to gain Clout with them and unlock their unique bonuses. Learn more about Neo-Cascadia, the origins of Fizzle, and how the drone shipping empire known as Cubicle came to dominate the city. Can you save your company and yourself from going under for good?<br /><br />One-time licence fee to download to multiple PS4 systems.

        "Desc": "Does everyone deserve a second chance? Can crimes ever be forgotten? Hiding behind the mask of the average man on the street, and furtively blending into the background, many war criminals, ex-Mafia members and other criminals have been literally getting away with murder, or worse. That is, until you turned up to ruin the party. As part of a secret and\u00a0mysterious society whose members have sworn to rid the world of these Bad Guys, it's your responsibility to make sure justice is served in the bloodiest possible way.<br /><br />Track the Bad Guys, be brutal and smart in your planning, and eliminate them one by one. But bear this in mind: each criminal's death has to look like an accident. In each level, you'll have the chance to splatter and destroy the Bad Guy using various weapons and traps. It's up to you to make sure he ends up in the wrong place at the right time.<br /><br />In this ingenious puzzle game in which physics plays an essential role, you'll need to keep a cool head and your wits about you.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

Sign in to PlayStation Network is not required to use this on your primary PS4, but is required for use on other PS4 systems.",

Your duty, for which you have trained your whole life, is to defeat the Seven Acolytes, accursed and powerful beings, possessed by malevolent deities called Gahars.<br /><br />Challenging foes, mini-bosses, and memorable large-scale boss fights with fully orchestrated music, are central to the world of Morbid. To overcome these obstacles you must master the combat, as well as improve your character and gear through a wealth of elements such as Quests, Perks, Runes, Upgrades, and Looting.<br /><br />The Gahars have bound their twisted minds to the flesh of the Seven Acolytes, for without hosts they cannot survive. You must slay the Acolytes, thus ridding the Gahars of their flesh. Succeed, and you'll free the kingdom from the heavy yoke of their terror. Fail, and the malicious gods rule on, as the Acolytes rise anew, and madness prevails.<br /><br />-Experience epic, brutal boss encounters and explore a diverse array of environments <br />-Perk levelling system with multiple ways to build your character<br />-Deep, immersive lore with NPC's to meet throughout the world<br />-Health, Stamina and Sanity management is important as you traverse the world<br /><br />Offline play enabled",

The land of Urralia is torn by war. But there is worse: as night falls, you witness the destruction of the world at the hands of a dark God.<br /><br />You are granted the power to relive this final day. Lead the investigation and appear alongside characters who played a part in the apocalypse, fight with them or against them, and use your Omensight power to weave a new narrative.<br /><br />Through your decisions, your skills and your wits, change the course of the day and, perhaps, pave the way to a brighter future.<br /><br />Featuring the top voice acting talents of Patricia Summersett (Zelda: Breath of the Wild) and Julian Casey (We Happy Few, Stories) and a stellar writing team, including Nadim Boukhira (Stories), Genese Davis (The Holder's Dominion) and Chris Avellone (Planescape: Torment, Pillars of Eternity).<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

How your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work.<br /><br />Some survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available for expeditions.

I'm VAL, your helpful and efficient Space Station AI!<br /><br />According to my records, this Station hasn't been used at all in the last 17 years! How very strange. Furthermore, it would appear that you are the only rational life form in this Sector. Well then, CONGRATULATIONS! I hereby officially pronounce you Commander of this Space Station! Hopefully you will enjoy more success than your predecessor who, according to the logbook, er\u2026 ran into some wormlike Aliens\u2026 Oh, nothing to worry about!<br /><br />To keep the same thing from happening to you, there's a lot you're going to have to do. Amongst others, there's the development of further Sectors, maintenance of the three vital Main Decks as well as the customer acquisition and entertainment of our extraterrestrial visitors, who provide us with sufficient Energy for our plans for global improvement. Oh, and before I forget \u2013 it's probably just a bug in my security protocols anyway \u2013 but my sensors are showing just loads of enemy creatures in all of the other Sectors\u2026<br /><br />So, what are we waiting for? Let's get to work! Let us join forces to conquer space.\"<br /><br />SPACEBASE STARTOPIA captivates with its original mixture of economic simulation and empire building strategy paired with classic RTS skirmishes and a good dose of humor. In addition to the challenging single player Campaign and the versatile battle mode, there are also competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes for up to four players. And as if maintaining the three Space Station Decks, entertaining the eight Alien races and defending against enemy invaders were not enough of a challenge, the dynamic narrator AI is not going to mince matters and commentates the events in a lovely but sharp-tongued manner.<br /><br />- The 10-mission, fully dubbed single-player Campaign will require all your skills as Commander of the Spacebase Startopia as you strive to create one of the most attractive trade and tourism destinations in the known universe.  <br />- Each of the three Decks will require your leadership skills, with the Sub Deck containing all of the Rooms vital to survival, while the Fun Deck focuses on your visitors and the flora and fauna found on the Bio Deck provides sufficient Resources for survival as well as a home to the graceful Dryads.<br />- Prevail against your competitors, for you are not alone on the Space Station. Sabotage your opponents' economy or attack them with your Mech Units, conduct trade and beware of Space Pirates eager to board your Station.<br />- The dynamic narrator AI \u201cVAL\u201d reacts to your decisions and is always at your side in both word and deed \u2013 and the occasional extremely unqualified comment.<br />- In addition to the extensive single player Campaign, an individually configurable sandbox mode as well as both a competitive and a cooperative multiplayer mode for up to four players awaits you.",

        "Desc": "The Council is an episodic game like no other. Delivering a fresh new take on the Narrative Adventure, your choices and character growth truly matter. Make hard-hitting decisions, but also develop an array of skills to directly impact how the story unfolds. With permanent, long-lasting consequences, there is no going back. Plunge into a tale of intrigue and manipulation in the style of a classic murder mystery, living with a cast of alluring characters each hiding their own dark secrets. Trust no one while uncovering dire truths \u2013 no matter the cost to mind and body.<br /><br />The Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after his invitation to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests \u2013Richet's own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.<br /><br />In a new twist for the genre, the core of The Council's gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character's psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean \u2018game over', and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent, and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player's adventure.<br /><br />Richet's numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council's mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.",

Their dynasty has been watching over Asposia for centuries on end. In secret, they fill the roly-poly world with light and life. But when their existence is discovered, they become hunted. Emil, a trader for odds and ends, made all the Asposians believe that the dynasty is in cahoots with dark forces. The only one who can stop the evil Emil is the heir to the throne: Robert. He has been petrified for three years, though. With a huge dose of enthusiasm, but little to no idea what he's actually doing, he embarks on an adventure to find the legendary last wind monk. Of course, he has some great company: Peck, as loyal as he is flightless, and Laura, a rebel who certainly does fly, but only off the handle - and who Robert loves, with a capital L. Everything changes, when they meet the mysterious Mama Dola, who seems to know more about Robert's destiny than Robert would like.",

Take the role of gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd, and come face to face with the ugly underbelly of Freeburg, a city spiraling the drain. Will Jack reach his retirement with a nice stack of bills, or will he end up broken ... or worse?<br /><br />Manage your staff, respond to emergencies, and investigate crimes in a city on the brink of chaos. The mafia underworld maneuvers behind the scenes, sinking their claws ever deeper into the city, even as the mayor is ready to exploit every situation to his political advantage.<br /><br />Choose your approach to each situation as it unfolds. Sometimes you'll be responding to a developing crisis at a crime scene, or negotiating with Freeburg's crime bosses. Sometimes you'll find yourself dodging questions in the press room, or even the occasional cross-examination in the witness box. Can you keep this pressure cooker from exploding, at least for long enough to stash away a nice retirement nest egg?<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.<br />  WARNING: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS MATERIAL WHICH MAY OFFEND AND MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED, CIRCULATED, SOLD, HIRED, GIVEN, LENT, SHOWN, PLAYED OR PROJECTED TO A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS",

Play as Kazuma Kiryu and discover how he finds himself in a world of trouble when a simple debt collection goes wrong and his mark winds up murdered.  Then, step into the silver-toed shoes of Goro Majima and explore his \u201cnormal\u201d life as the proprietor of a cabaret club.  <br />Switch between three different fighting styles instantaneously and beat up all manner of goons, thugs, hoodlums, and lowlifes.  Take combat up a notch by using environmental objects such as bicycles, sign posts, and car doors for bone-crunching combos and savage take-downs.<br />Fighting is not the only way to kill time in 1988's Japan: from discos and hostess clubs to classic SEGA arcades, there are tons of distractions to pursue in the richly detailed, neon-lit world.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

        "Desc": "One year after the 10 billion yen incident, Kazuma Kiryu begins to build a peaceful life with Haruka Sawamura. Tearing him away, an assassination threatens to erupt in an all-out war between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance. Kiryu, the Dragon of Dojima, must travel to Sotenbori, Osaka in an attempt to broker peace between the rival clans, but Ryuji Goda, known as the Dragon of Kansai, will stop at nothing to get his war. In this world, there can only be one dragon.<br /><br />Rebuilt from the ground up, Yakuza Kiwami 2 uses the Dragon Engine to update one of the series stand-out titles into a modern classic. Play fan favorite minigames including updated versions of the Cabaret Club simulator and Clan Creator, or check out all new additions like an arcade port of Virtual On, golf bingo, and Toylets. Also new to Kiwami 2 is the \"Majima Saga\" which features Goro Majima in his own playable adventure revealing events that occur prior to the game.<br /><br />Purchase or use of this item is subject to SEN Terms of Service and User Agreement.",

The game counts with a solid story which unfolds in a fantasy world populated by dozens of unorthodox characters. Adventuring, exploring ruins, accidentally unleashing the apocalypse, saving the world\u2026 you've done it all, and so has Argus. And, frankly, he's a bit fed up with the whole thing. He used to be a wizard, which was fine and all, but he's in his 30s now, and he wants to settle down, get some peace and quiet. But that's not easy to get with all those spike-haired buffoons dragging their giant swords around and ruining the pavement. Specially when you're trying to keep a dangerous artifact hidden from meddling heroes with a chosen one complex.<br /><br />Zenith \u00a92016 Infinigon.
