Taking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name. Don't be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown! Story A long time ago... In a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none. The knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun. ...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames, a cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim. The shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine. Its color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign. And with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand. While Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned. In haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair. To the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware. Gameplay Just like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy! Ghosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins. In Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm! In addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy! Make full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it! On top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series. Connect two controllers to play with a friend, side by side. Note: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported. Experience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!","SaleStarted":"2022-09-14","LowestPrice":"/game/87808","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png?w=200","MainStory":6,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-CUSA24159_00-MAKAIRE000000001","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F177-VTSGSM","PercentOff":"34%","Completionist":22,"genre":"Action","PlusPrice":19.79,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202104/0208/eG96ezbEvWZlakXpMKYJZrUY.png","OpenCriticURL":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection","Title":"Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"Capcom U.S.A., Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2021-06-01","Slug":"ghosts-n-goblins-resurrection-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":29.99,"MainExtra":6,"SalePrice":19.79,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"69","SaleEnds":"2022-09-29","description":"Stranded on the shores of a mysterious island, you must learn to survive.

This brick breaker shooting game is jam-packed with items and surprises. GUNBARICH is a brick breaker shooter game that first appeared in arcades in 2001. Break all blocks to clear the stage by using the flipper to shoot out the pink ball (puck). Be careful! You'll lose if you run out of time or if the puck drops below the screen. The flipper isn't just for shooting pucks, it can repel enemy attacks as well! Hitting enemy characters with one of their own repelled bullets deals massive damage to them. Use the left and right inputs to control the trajectory of the puck and enemy bullets that land on the flipper. The game comes with options you can tweak to your liking. Pick your preferred difficulty, max lives, max continues, key controls, item drop speed, enemy bullet speed, flipper rapid-fire function, and more to make the game just right for you. Don't forget about the new online rankings! Do you have what it takes to become the best GUNBARICH in the world? Characters: Little Great Wizard Marion - Magic is my business! Power: ★ Speed: ★★ Magic: ★★★ Flying Pirate Grutan - Power is life! Power: ★★★ Speed: ★ Magic: ★★ Options: Play in vertical screen mode for that nostalgic arcade experience! Lives can be set between 1 to 9, whereas continues can be set between 0 to infinity. The new \"Arrange\" option also allows you to slow down item drop speed and enemy bullet speed.

Most people live in megacities that rely on the labor of poor masses to sustain a modern standard of living for the few at the top. With the Earth scorched, water is liquid gold, and control of it is the truest form of power. Forced to cope with a permanent water shortage, ordinary people persist and toil in the hope that if they work hard enough, they too can someday swim every morning in the refreshing pools of the Gardens. We follow the story of Josephine Lace, a young hydraulic engineer eager to climb the corporate ladder and claim a spot at the top. Until the day when that promising future is ripped away from her, leaving her half-dead and homeless, she becomes hellbent on taking down the system that ruined her and left her without a heart. Along the way she meets a diverse group of people sympathetic to her cause, every one with secrets of their own. With their help, perhaps she will find redemption, love, and most of all - vengeance.

Nothing strikes fear into your enemies more than a well-crafted piece of Samurai armor, and with 7 pieces to choose from, there's plenty of options. The additional 2 new weapons, and tactical are just the icing on the cake. That\u2019s not all, the 3 new weapon skins are just as important for your enemies as they are you, at least they\u2019ll know they\u2019ve been slain by the best looking weapons out there. Let them keep some dignity... The Cyber Warrior Pack contains: 2 NEW WEAPONS \u2022 Brosnan, a ballistic automatic rifle: low calibre ammunition combined with extreme exit speed allows for piercing bullets to cut through most obstacles, puncturing intestines and plating alike. \u2022 Interuptor, a new special weapon: stasis tech cleverly applied to live ammunition, allowing for great crowd control and pure blue chaos when used right! 1 NEW TACTICAL \u2022 PLM22 Surge, a lethal mine: mainly used as a defence against monobot and robot units, these charged proximity mines comes packed with a very strong digital blast that'll fry most nearby systems. 7 PIECES OF ARMOR \u2022 Feud Vest, Basic torso protection Light and unrestrictive. The Feud vest allows for great flexibility and doesn't hinder your movement. A good choice when speed and efficiency are important. \u2022 Feud Armor, medium torso protection The main piece in the Feud line. It offers full upper body protection without slowing you down. If you want a true Cyber Warrior experience, this is for you. \u2022 Feud Banner, advanced torso protection What could possibly make the Feud Armor better? It carries with it many of the properties from the original armor but with a slightly more premium build. \u2022 Nomad, basic head protection An old-school helmet that\u2019s mainly used when working outside of settlements in rough environments. Whilst not offering the latest in tech and features, it still provides solid protection against having your head bashed in. \u2022 Feud Mask, medium head protection The mark piece for the Cyber Warrior kit. You don't need to fake a smile with this on. It does a decent job of protecting your face while also boosting several aspects of the wearer. \u2022 Feud Helmet, advanced head protection The full headpiece for the Cyber Warrior kit. If you want to put fear in your enemies, this is the answer. Thanks to very light material, it allows for great manoeuvrability despite its large size. \u2022 Feud Trousers, medium leg protection A set of fairly neutral trousers that goes with the Cyber Warrior Feud set. Offering a safeguard against your shins, the Feud Trousers complete Cyber Warrior experience. 3 NEW WEAPON SKINS \u2022 2 new animated weapon skins: Glitch Green and Glitch Red \u2022 1 new weapon skin: Ultra Be the Samurai Cyber Warrior you deserve to be!

Estera, a once proud and thriving world, is torn apart by war between the two large city-states; Tirig, the largest military in the land who praise the Gods, and the city-state Helmgar, the Godless heretics to the north. Build your party and venture forth to discover the secrets behind ancient long-abandoned cities and decide where your own morality ultimately lies in this turn-based action strategy game. CHARACTERS Play as a varied and exciting cast of characters on your adventure through Estera, each with their own abilities and view on each other. As war continues to split the land, will camaraderie conquer all or will personal views rip your team apart? COMBAT Create your party from five different classes and dozens of playable characters. Combine hundreds of unique skills to ensure victory and never have the same fight twice as each character features its own upgrade and leveling tree. STRATEGY Combine abilities to create powerful combos against your foes, or combine defensive abilities to negate the deadliest attacks. Combine burn, freeze, stun, cripple and more to obtain your goals, and use magic and tactics to protect your heroes. NARRATIVE Decide your fate with a deep branching narrative and choice-driven decisions. Your actions may lead to an outcome which the world of Estera may not deserve. Should your party feature characters from all sides of the war, opinions may clash - with disastrous consequences. WORLD Explore the stunning world of Estera and breathe in the beautiful hand-illustrated locations. Venture deep into murky dangerous woods, roam vibrant busy towns, and ransack long-forgotten tombs. From the dizzying heights of Tower Of The Ancients to the harsh lands of Arralash, the world is yours to discover.","SaleStarted":"2022-09-14","LowestPrice":"/game/84383","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/0415/3XHDLxcgAUq4QrYoAmeP5ca5.png?w=200","MainStory":7,"platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4293-CUSA26134_00-TEARSOFAVIASIEA4","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klMShjfsvJY","PercentOff":"40%","Completionist":0,"genre":"Role-Playing","PlusPrice":8.99,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202111/0415/3XHDLxcgAUq4QrYoAmeP5ca5.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Tears of Avia","ESRBRating":"USD","Publisher":"PQUBE LTD","ReleaseDate":"2021-11-18","Slug":"tears-of-avia-playstation-us","NumberofPlayers":"","IsPS5":0,"Price":14.99,"MainExtra":0,"SalePrice":8.99,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2022-09-29","description":"Stranded Sails \u2013 Explorers of the Cursed Islands is an open world, exploration and farming adventure full of quests and discovery!
