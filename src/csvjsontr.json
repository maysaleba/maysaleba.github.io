Story Under a piercing blue sky, surrounded by crystal clear water, the sun scorched Ao Hoshizaki's skin. Gazing at the summer scenery, it seemed as if the girl was left behind in a world that she had wandered into. At a school adrift in the distance, there lived three girls who had lost their memories. The only thing they could remember was their names. Ao, shrouded in confusion, begins to lead a strange communal life with the girls as they seek clues about a way to return to their original world. One day, in this world where the school was surrounded by nothing but water, a path that led to new scenery suddenly appeared. At the end of the path was a mysterious location, where familiar things existed inexplicably. In order to grasp the situation, the girls decided to venture forward, but as soon as they took their first steps, they encountered a monster they had never seen before. But just when they thought things had become hopeless, the girls obtain a mysterious power. In a world that seemed to be trapped in summer, young girls have lost their memories. If the girls solve the mystery, what will they obtain? Features ■Make your very own school with \"School Development\"! The girls are the only ones at the school surrounded by water. You can freely build useful facilities the girls come up with, such as a \"Takoyaki Stand\" or \"Pool\". By building the facilities that your favorite girls like, or simply the ones you are interested in, you can enjoy building a school to your liking. ■The command-style battles are even faster with \"Exhilarating Real Time Battles\"! The real-time battles from the previous game have been greatly improved with this title's exhilarating real time battles, allowing players to increase the tempo of battles based on the amount of time elapsed and the skills they use. By unleashing skills one after another to chain together combos and aim for maximum damage, battles will excite players with their sheer speed and power! ■Communicate with the girls in a wide variety of ways! By listening to the girls' requests, going on dates with them, and more, players can communicate with the girls at the school in a variety of ways. By strengthening your bonds with the girls, they will develop, and new items can be obtained. ■Explore beautiful, mysterious worlds! In this game, you explore Heartscapes, locations that embody the heart and mind of each character.

The Shadowrun Trilogy comprises 3 cult tactical RPG games taking place in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which magic has re-awakened, bringing back to life creatures of high fantasy. Initially created as a tabletop RPG over 30 years ago, this one-of-a-kind setting that has gained a huge cult following during the past three decades. Shadowrun Returns The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Nearly 10 years ago, creator Jordan Weisman returned to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city\u2019s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It\u2019s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge\u2019s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the \u201cFlux State\u201d controls the city of Berlin. It\u2019s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there\u2019s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return\u2026 Shadowrun Hong Kong - Extended Edition HONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world\u2019s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale. As an ex-con living in Seattle, you try to make an honest living but when your foster begs you to meet him in China, things turn grim and you find out the police are trying to arrest you. And by arrest, they mean to kill you on sight! Build your team of Shadowrunners, mercenaries with big personalities who can fight using mystical or technical powers, and turn the tables on the elite corporate and the police.

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ is an official adaptation based on the literary works of J.R.R Tolkien. He's got nothing more to lose\u2026 How far will he go to retrieve his Precious? Taking place in parallel to the events described in The Fellowship of the Ring ™, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-adventure game and an epic interactive experience. You play as the enigmatic Gollum on his perilous journey and find out how he outwitted the most powerful characters in Middle-earth. THE UNTOLD STORY He has survived dangers most wouldn't dare talk about, driven by the singular desire to once again hold in his hands what was stolen from him. Although his desperate quest is a central part of the story crafted by J.R.R. Tolkien, it has never been told in detail. For the first time, follow the untold story of Gollum: an experience that stays incredibly faithful to the books. From his flight from Mordor, where he escaped the Mouth of Sauron and the demon-spider Shelob, to the dungeons of the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father, Gollum has had many adventures and encounters on his extraordinary journey. ACTION AND STEALTH After being corrupted by the Ring over hundreds of years, Gollum has developed exceptional agility and sharp wits. Use his unique skills to explore and infiltrate legendary locations and dizzying heights. Find your way past the Orcs as you climb the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr and give the Elves the slip in the mysterious Mirkwood. While Gollum is no fighter, he is more than capable of strangling a careless enemy when the opportunity presents itself\u2026 or of finding a more creative and less risky way of getting out of trouble. ONE CHARACTER, TWO PERSONALITIES Gollum is one of the most fascinating characters in The Lord of the Rings universe. In 500 years he has experienced events that would destroy the toughest of beings. But Gollum doesn't break; he bends, he adapts\u2026 Tortured by his split personality, he can be vicious and wicked as Gollum, yet friendly and cautious as Smeagol. It's up to you to decide which of his personalities will triumph in the difficult moral choices that will dictate the future of your precarious alliances.","SaleStarted":"2023-09-26","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1516/cec5fbb61cd4453f65ef3a79fd63af8b8b7548cb22c91c4f.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP6665-PPSA06366_00-LRG00DELUXE00001","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Adventure","PlusPrice":649.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202305/1516/cec5fbb61cd4453f65ef3a79fd63af8b8b7548cb22c91c4f.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum™ - Precious Edition","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"NACON SA","ReleaseDate":"2023-05-25","Slug":"the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum--precious-edition-ps4&ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":1299,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":649.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-10-11","description":"All aboard the express train to riches and fame in Railway Empire 2!

This game is worth every penny, and you should buy it right now, why? Firstly because the whole story was written during a live-stream, which makes the story totally nonsensical! If this doesn't convince you remember that not only do I have a gun, I also know all your secrets. This is of course a joke, I do not know your secrets, yet. The game even features some of the most famous actors to have ever lived, including \"Thrash94Gaming\" you might know him for never being in a movie. \"LaraCroft86\" you might know her for also not being in any movie. Lastly but mostly least \"Gamer Jeffro\" for his famous role as Asa Gray in the video game that you are about to buy. Thankfully this game also includes two actors from Kimulator's Films, sadly they also were never in anything noteworthy. You might wonder who I am, well I'm Sheesh-Man, I literally come from another planet, I'm like an alien, a spooky sheeshing alien to say the truth. Don't challenge me or I will sheesh your whole family, including your dog, it's not a threat, it's a fact. Now back to the game, it features over 2 hours of video footage of me and my worst enemy Swag-Girl, who even says Swag in 2023? Pft, we all know Sheeshing is the new hip and cool thing to do. This game is an interactive movie telling the story of how I went on earth and became a super-hero or whatever, it's pretty sick if you ask me! Not sick in the sense that you will throw up, but in the sense that it's cool. This my friend was a word play, you can expect this level of humour in the game, may I say it even gets better than this, not a lot, but at least a little bit. The game as a ton of bonus content too! Even a video of Mini the dog taking a shower, can you believe it? I surely can, because it's true and it's literally in the game. Either way, I don't think you need more reasons to buy the game but I will give you another one, this game includes 4 PSN Avatars!

Known as the Sisters of Battle, they heroically stride through the thickest fighting, shielded by their fanatical devotion and tempered by discipline at the peak of human capability. They stand against all heresy and will go to extreme lengths to root it out whenever and wherever it may be found. The Daughters of the Emperor A long standing order with a rich history, the Adepta Sororitas have always lived in service of the Emperor. Their unrelenting faith and rigorous training provides them with a mental fortitude rare among those that serve the Imperium. This divine protection, perhaps from the very spirit of the Emperor himself, makes every sister an incorruptible fortress that turns aside the profane, the blasphemous, the heretic. 15 units of the Order stand ready to turn back the unworthy on Baal. The sisters may call on the Emperor\u2019s Guidance through their HQ units, firing rounds that seemingly possess uncanny accuracy and inflict greater damage. Lead your Congregation Devotion and faith empowers the blood of the martyrs. None understands this more than the mighty Canoness. Defended by the Celestian Sacresants, she leads her sisters in matters of faith and duty. Every life given in glorious service to the Emperor drives her to greater feats in service and battle. The sisterhood reveres the lives given to the Emperor, inspiring them to greater feats and shielding them from the deadliest of blows. The canoness can bless her allies or curse her foes with empowered faith abilities. Her scorn itself is a powerful weapon that cows the unfaithful. Celestian Sacresants carry stout bulwarks that turn aside any damage that would target her. Command the Sinner It is not only the faithful that serve the Sisterhood. Those that have sinned in the eyes of the Emperor may yet atone for their crimes in service in battle, as Arco Flagellants. If a sister would seek such atonement, then she shall be given her chance to take the oath of the Repentia. The Sisters Repentia\u2019s devotion to reclaim the favour of the Emperor is absolute, they have no fear, and seek only forgiveness through deeds in battle. His spirit can push them to superhuman endurance, briefly increasing their movement and the movement of the sisters that fight alongside them. In Duty to Humanity The Adepta Sororitas are the champions of the poor, the weak, the helpless and the downtrodden. The Sister Hospitallers express their love for the Emperor's people through healing the sick and wounded. On the battlefield, though they are no less deadly than their counterparts, they can often be found in the rear lines, healing grievous injuries and counteracting deadly poisons. Rapidly returning the critically wounded to the front lines, to seek further service and glory in the eyes of The Emperor. The Sisters Hospitallers can restore hit points and remove status effects from their battle brethren, while still being capable units in their own right. Command the Faithful As the mighty Paragon Warsuit smashes down enemies with its enormous warblade, the Exorcist rains missiles on all around it. In the Adepta Sororitas DLC, you will command 15 such blessed units of the order, primed and ready for battle in Skirmish, Multiplayer, Planetary Supremacy and the new Daemonic Incursion mode. Each unit comes with its own unique and exquisitely crafted models and abilities, as well as all new HQ abilities for the faction as a whole.","SaleStarted":"2023-09-26","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/3014/3Porn2H27iuxyii4vkwjsLSK.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4136-CUSA25074_00-BSECTORDLCSIEE04","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"20%","Completionist":"","genre":"Strategy","PlusPrice":119.2,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202211/3014/3Porn2H27iuxyii4vkwjsLSK.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector - Sisters of Battle","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Slitherine","ReleaseDate":"2022-12-16","Slug":"warhammer-40000-battlesector--sisters-of-battle-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":149,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":119.2,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-10-11","description":"Get your funk\u2019n\u2019groove on with Synth Riders and the Groovin\u2019 Essentials Music Pack, featuring Bruno Mars, Silk Sonic & Starcadian in a 24K-lineup of award-winning hits. 5 stellar songs with strong roots in disco & funk, make this a perfect soundtrack as you dance \u2018til dawn! \u2022 24K Magic - Bruno Mars \u2022 Runaway Baby - Bruno Mars \u2022 Skate - Bruno Mars, Andersen .Paak & Silk Sonic \u2022 Manuals - Starcadian \u2022 Supersymmetry - Starcadian Synth Riders sets this party off with Bruno Mars\u2019 chart-topping hits \u201c24K Magic\u201d & \u201cRunaway Baby\u201d, before you \u201cSkate\u201d back to the 70s with Silk Sonic, the Grammy award-winning collaboration between Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak.

The Lystrosaurus is notable for its tusks and horned beak, used to bite bits of vegetation. Oviraptor A smaller predator with a distinctive head crest, the Oviraptor has a unique feathered look. Originally believed to steal eggs of other dinosaurs, it was dubbed the \u2018Egg Thief\u2019, but it has since been understood to be an omnivore with a powerful jaw for its size.

The legendary mercenary Wolfhound has stopped contacting his customers a long time ago. Of course, many thought that the Valley had ruined him, but in fact it was a man who tried to do so. Which is not surprising, considering how many enemies a hired killer can have. One night, when Wolfhound arrived at a routine meeting with his client, the mercenary was ambushed. The abandoned plant, where the meeting was supposed to take place, was turned into a pile of rubble and dust, but the vigilantes could not find Wolfhound\u2019s body in it. They couldn\u2019t find his car either. The mercenary\u2019s enemies celebrated their victory and went on with their lives, forgetting about Wolfhound like a bad dream. But a few years later, one of the vigilantes fell into a familiar snare, and seconds later all that was left of his armored car was a flaming pile of metal. One by one, those who had once tried to destroy the mercenary began to die under similar circumstances, and all of them met the same unfortunate end. Wolfhound has returned, but he stopped killing for money. Now all those who had once used his services started to die. The rumors about the emergence of a terrifying ghost named Barghest started to spread around the Valley. People just couldn\u2019t believe that the mercenary could have survived that attempt on his life, and decided that he had really become a ghost. A far more dangerous and terrifying ghost than Wolfhound himself had been. The unique armoured car presented in the pack is known for its balance of weapons, combination of modules and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, go to the \u201cPacks\u201d tab, select the desired armoured car and click the \u201cAssemble\u201d button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases to 55. Attention! Storage overflow is possible under certain conditions. Buying the pack also gives early access to several structural parts. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy. Unique portraits provide an excellent opportunity to stand out among the survivors. Paint cans are a way to make your armored car different from the pack. Coins \u2014 is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention! When buying multiple packs, the acquired coins stack!","SaleStarted":"2023-09-26","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2112/seAGJJ0JuFb978ziSiYuap7Z.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4432-CUSA06859_00-EB00870000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Simulation, Unique","PlusPrice":449.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202203/2112/seAGJJ0JuFb978ziSiYuap7Z.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Crossout \u2013 Barghest","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Gaijin Distribution KFT","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-25","Slug":"crossout--barghest-ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":899,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":449.5,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-10-11","description":"Embark on an epic adventure full of whimsy, wonder, and high-powered weaponry!

Inspired by Universal Pictures, Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Animation\u2019s hit Netflix show, Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous, this DLC features two entirely new dinosaurs, two new variants for existing species, and eight eye-catching skins that players can use to bring their parks to life. ﻿ SCORPIOS REX One of Dr. Henry Wu\u2019s first hybrid creations, the Scorpios Rex is a truly fearsome carnivore. Blood-red eyes, charcoal-black scales, prominent spikes, and jagged, uneven teeth characterise this impressive species. Known for its aggressive nature, it was originally deemed unfit for display\u2026until now. MONOLOPHOSAURUS Named for the single crest adorning its skull, the Monolophosaurus is a medium-sized carnivore from the mid-Jurassic period. Its distinguished crest helps intensify roars and aids communication between Monolophosauruses. OURANOSAURUS (Variant) The Ouranosaurus is a peaceful herbivore that lives in large herds. Keeping a single Ouranosaurus is not advised, as lone individuals have been known to break out of their enclosures and panic guests. The Ouranosaurus has a broad snout and tall spines on its back supporting a camel-like hump. KENTROSAURUS (Variant) Despite being covered in lethal-looking spikes, the Kentrosaurus is actually a docile herbivore that uses its beak to bite off plant material. One of the smallest species of stegosaur, the Kentrosaurus defends itself when threatened using long spikes on each shoulder and smaller spikes protruding from its hips and tail. 8 NEW DINOSAUR SKINS Bring the Baryonyx trio Grim, Limbo and Chaos, plus Toro the Carnotaurus, Bumpy the Ankylosaurus, and Big Eatie the Tyrannosaurus Rex to life in your parks, and entrance your guests with two glow-in-the-dark skins inspired by the Parasaurolophus Lux. · 1 Ankylosaurus skin - Bumpy · 3 Baryonyx skins - Grim, Limbo, Chaos · 1 Carnotaurus skin - Toro · 2 Parasaurolophus Lux skins - Lux 1 (glow in the dark), Lux 2 (glow in the dark) · 1 Tyrannosaurus rex skin - Big Eatie","SaleStarted":"2023-09-26","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2115/VlZzWssgw9IYJNxeFk6f82rW.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP2377-PPSA03286_00-CAMPCRETACEOUSPK","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Simulation, Strategy","PlusPrice":89.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202202/2115/VlZzWssgw9IYJNxeFk6f82rW.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Jurassic World Evolution 2: Camp Cretaceous Dinosaur Pack","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC","ReleaseDate":"2022-03-08","Slug":"jurassic-world-evolution-2-camp-cretaceous-dinosaur-pack-ps4&ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":179,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":89.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-10-11","description":"Horror Break Mega Game Bundle includes six of your favorite Break game titles for one price!

You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor \u2014 the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You\u2019ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor\u2019s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. A WORLD AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall \u2014 a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost.

The story begins right after the Battle of Kursk, where the game provides the option to import a core force from either the Panzerkrieg or Sandstorm campaign. The first five scenarios are based on the historical 1st Soviet offensive in the Donbass in summer 1943, up to the Leningrad\u2013Novgorod strategic offensive in early 1944. A decisive defeat of the Red Army will eventually allow total victory over the Soviet Union, while failure to do so will turn the campaign away from the Eastern Front and into the Battle of Anzio in Italy.

Initially you'll be forced on the defensive, and you'll be tasked to extract other German forces from the Falaise trap, defeat Allied airborne units in Market-Garden, and defend the city of Aachen and the Huertgenwald against heavy attacks.

Lead your army through exciting single-player campaigns. Scenario after scenario, you will carry-over your troops from one battle to the next, fighting on all fronts of World War II, from Burma to Finland, from North Africa to the Pacific Ocean. Over 1000 unique unit types are available, as well as commanders, specializations, and a smart supply system. COMMANDERS A set of unique Commanders \u2013 split between Generals, Pilots and Captains \u2013 is gradually unlocked in the campaigns. These can be attached to specific units to provide unique bonuses to anything in their command range. While good use of unit types and tactics remains the player's priority, clever use of Commanders can tip the balance in an offensive operation or buy just enough time in defense to turn the tide to your favor. SUPPLY SYSTEM In Order of Battle: World War II, a unique supply system also plays a key factor that directly affects the combat efficiency of the units. Landing on an enemy island without any support ships will prevent the invasion forces from building a solid beachhead, and breaking the supply lines of your opponent, isolating his units and making encirclement maneuvers are the strategies required to achieve an ultimate victory. THE BLITZKRIEG CAMPAIGN IS INCLUDED The Blitzkrieg campaign puts you in charge of the German Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. Starting with the conquest of Poland, the campaign features the defeat of the Franco-British alliance on the western front, the invasion of the Soviet Union and finally the assault on Moscow in 1941. On 1 September 1939, under the pretext of reclaiming the city of Danzig, German armed forces invade Poland. Honoring their diplomatic treaties and driven by the desire to maintain the balance of power in Europe, France and Great Britain swiftly declare war on Germany. This chain of events sets in motion the greatest war the world has ever seen: a Second World War. In the early years of the conflict, Germany displays a successful incorporation of modern aircraft and tank technology into its traditional tactic of Bewegungskrieg. These tactics rely on deep penetrations by armoured forces, supported by aggressive air attacks and prove to be highly effective at encircling and finally destroying the enemy. Resulting in lightning fast victories, the new form of warfare is referred to as the Blitzkrieg. This campaign includes more than 200 units, greatly expanding the unit rosters of Germany, France, Britain and the Soviet Union as well as adding several minor nations to the game. Among the German units are the Panzer III and IV series, Bf109 and Fw190 fighter aircraft and powerful 88mm anti-aircraft guns, while the Allies have access to heavily armoured Matilda and Char B1 tanks, Spitfires, Hurricanes and unique Armoured Train units. 12 Scenarios: Mlawa, Warsaw, Norway, Belgium, Fall Rot, Dunkirk, Yugoslavia, Greece, Minsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Moscow.

Highly resistant to conventional attack methods, extreme measures needed to be taken to battle the overwhelming threat and preserve humanity.

Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don\u2019t worry though, as any crafting progress you\u2019ve made is retained from one to another. Tydy DLC adds a completely new org to Void Bastards along with a dangerous new opponent, a brutal new weapon, three new ships to explore and more!","SaleStarted":"2023-09-26","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/2600/pqzR8aqEnJBh1DjbJqdOEbRc.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3717-CUSA16300_00-VBBUNDLE0000000E","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"70%","Completionist":"","genre":"Arcade, Strategy","PlusPrice":179.7,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202102/2600/pqzR8aqEnJBh1DjbJqdOEbRc.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Void Bastards: DeLUXe Bundle","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Humble Games","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-29","Slug":"void-bastards-deluxe-bundle-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":599,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":179.7,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-10-11","description":"- Armoured vehicle \u201cHarmony\u201d; - Unique weapon of epic rarity \u201cYongwang\u201d; - Unique portrait \u201cMunmu\u201d; - Paint can \u201cDark gold\u201d; - 1500 in-game coins.

The appearance of a permanent Syndicate outpost in the Valley was only a matter of time. The \u201cDragons\u201d habitually occupied several business centers, which soon shined with neon lights. And soon the Survivors heard rumours about the keeper of newly developed places \u2014 Munmu. Ruthless and rarely participating in any negotiations, he quickly demonstrated to local raiders that those who challenge the Syndicate do not live long. The unique armored cars presented in packs are known for their perfect balance of weapons, armour and speed in combat. To put the car in the garage, after starting the game, open the blueprint menu (\u201cB\u201d key ), go to the \u201cPacks\u201d tab, select the desired armoured car and press the \u201cAssemble\u201d button. When you purchase this pack, the number of parts that can be used to build a vehicle increases up to 62. Buying the pack also gives early access to several faction-specific structural parts. These parts become available immediately upon purchase and are not issued again upon reaching the appropriate reputation level. Some parts are unique and can only exist in a single copy. When simultaneously buying a standard and deluxe pack the constructional parts and portraits are not duplicated Unique portraits provide an excellent opportunity to stand out among the survivors. Paint cans are a way to make your armored car different from the pack. Coins \u2014 is the in-game currency, which is used on the market to purchase armoured car parts from other survivors and to pay for the rent of part-building workbenches. Attention! When buying multiple packs, the acquired coins stack!","SaleStarted":"2023-09-26","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202103/3006/86K2ZtylFZ9KdKsrkZqeKO9W.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP4432-CUSA06859_00-EB00620000000000","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"Action, Simulation, Unique","PlusPrice":269.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202103/3006/86K2ZtylFZ9KdKsrkZqeKO9W.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Crossout - Triad: The Keeper","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Gaijin Distribution KFT","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-26","Slug":"crossout--triad-the-keeper-ps5-tr","IsPS5":1,"Price":539,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":269.5,"IsPS4":0},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-10-11","description":"In Kaze and the Wild Masks, you journey through the Crystal Islands in 90\u2019s classics platformer style.

You and your prime mates will be tasked with raising all sorts of quirky constructions on distant planets, by stacking blocks so they fit a given outline. To do so, you will have to team up with other space faring animals and master the use of your trusty apequipment - a banana-fuelled jetpack and a powerful robo-arm. On top of that, you\u2019ll have to utilize the wackiest kinds of blocks (magnets, rockets and even nuclear fusion are no strangers for a well-trained astronaut like yourself), and work in exotic and not-quite-monkey-friendly places. Who said space construction was going to be easy? Monkey around with your friends! Moving heavy blocks is no small feat. Fortunately, up to 4 friends can join forces together to carry this burden (or drop it on each other's heads). Monkey around by yourself Waiting for friends to join you? Don\u2019t worry! You can have fun in the single player campaign! Fancy blocks for every occasion To make the job more interesting, you\u2019ll find some rather unusual blocks at your disposal.

Welcome to Gehenna, a brutal frontier planet at the outskirts of space. You've come to the town of Vestige in hopes of collecting a bounty on The Devil Riders, a violent gang of beast-riding mercenaries. Only the scrappiest folks have managed to survive out here - like Rose, a tough-as-nails warrior who's as keen with a katana as a pistol, and Juno, a rugged brawler most locals call The Hatchet. To take down The Devil Riders, you'll need to learn new tricks to survive Gehenna. Indigenous plants and experiments left behind by a mysterious company open up new approaches to combat and exploration. The new Jetbeast vehicle acts as your trusty steed, a customizable hoverbike. All the while, an enigmatic narrator recounts the details of your rough-and-tumble heroics. Grab your six-shooter - or whatever fancy guns you Vault Hunters carry these days - and go put those damned Devil Riders in the ground.

He lost all of his limbs somehow, and has no idea of what happened. He is a little bit crazy, but he can communicate with you.. You don't have much clue of what to do either, but since you are a little bit smarter than Bob, you are in charge. At the start of the game, Bob's battery is now nearly empty. Coincidentally there is battery pack just up the road ahead. If he goes and gets it himself, he will trip over and fall down the pit. Your first task is to look at the path and send him instructions on how to get there. Bob is very happy you are going on this adventure with him because you will help him find his lost limbs which are currently scattered around, and also plenty of oil tins . You are admired for your ingenuity in guiding Bob through this difficult journey.","SaleStarted":"2023-09-26","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/113079-jmJQfuv9wBi7jNSLzYpFmEmYNJ5gpn-NrDVUMf5tYErogk2tJ06Q3tjHejfkR9332dSSj-pypv4y17W6tlAoheNm-.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP3540-CUSA16572_00-JSSPS4RELEASEBUN","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"25%","Completionist":"","genre":"Puzzle","PlusPrice":36.75,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/113079-jmJQfuv9wBi7jNSLzYpFmEmYNJ5gpn-NrDVUMf5tYErogk2tJ06Q3tjHejfkR9332dSSj-pypv4y17W6tlAoheNm-.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"Jump, Step, Step","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"Hidden Trap","ReleaseDate":"2020-03-19","Slug":"jump-step-step-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":49,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":36.75,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"1990-01-01","description":"","SaleStarted":"1989-12-17","LowestPrice":"","Image":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202105/2817/PSyOUaCXdZ1YqSIn3R9vuN0c.png?w=200","MainStory":"","platform":"Playstation","URL":"https://store.playstation.com/en-tr/product/EP0700-CUSA16171_00-MHOJ2SEASONPASS0","Trailer":"","PercentOff":"50%","Completionist":"","genre":"","PlusPrice":179.5,"MexPrice":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202105/2817/PSyOUaCXdZ1YqSIn3R9vuN0c.png","OpenCriticURL":"","Title":"MY HERO ONE'S JUSTICE 2 Season Pass","ESRBRating":"TRD","Publisher":"","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01","Slug":"my-hero-ones-justice-2-season-pass-ps4-tr","IsPS5":0,"Price":359,"MainExtra":"","SalePrice":179.5,"IsPS4":1},{"SCORE":"","SaleEnds":"2023-10-11","description":"Note: The \"ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV: Diplomacy and Strategy Expansion Pack Bundle\", which is a set that includes the combined content of \"ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV\" and the \"ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV: Diplomacy and Strategy Expansion Pack\" is also available for purchase.
