Welcome to the world of Shift Happens - the only game out there which doesn't take a closer look at the body mass index and where players are actually forced to work together (and occasionally stab each other in the back). Experience thrilling adventures in four totally different worlds: ● Explore a freaked out laboratory where Bismo and Plom had their accident! ● Uncover the secrets of the overgrown green forests... ● ... and survive the dry canyons where a deadly wind awaits you\u2026 ● ... just to prepare you for the bitingly cold caves! The twist: Shift Happens is pure fun for solo players, yet its full potential can only be experienced together. Play it with your best friend while hanging around on a couch enjoying a pizza. Together you can solve puzzles and fight over precious coins. Coordination and communication are key to a successful journey. We recommend using gamepads for maximum enjoyability. The game also features a singleplayer mode with different level content. Although the game is primarily meant to be played by two people, you can play the completely different singleplayer levels without another person. The game features all the good things you should expect from a co-op platformer: ● Over 40 levels of handcrafted fun ● Local co-op gameplay ● Extra challenges/rewards in the levels for completionists and explorers ● More than 30 different levels\u2026","Image":"https://images.weserv.nl/?url=https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_ShiftHappens_image500w.jpg&w=240","URL":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/shift-happens-switch/","platform":"Switch","Trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdjOSxpsiQo","PeruPrice":"4.50","PercentOff":"87%","genre":"Platformer,Action,Puzzle,Multiplayer","ArgentinaPrice":"119.90","AustraliaPrice":"22.5","MexPrice":"https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/11_square_images/games_18/nintendo_switch_download_software/SQ_NSwitchDS_ShiftHappens.jpg","ColombiaPrice":"4490","SouthafricaPrice":"197","BrazilPrice":"6.20","OpenCriticURL":"https://opencritic.com/game/11250/shift-happens-switch","RussiaPrice":"1299","Title":"Shift Happens","ESRBRating":"Everyone","Publisher":"Daedalic GmbH","ReleaseDate":"2018-10-10","Slug":"shift-happens-switch","NumberofPlayers":"up to 2 players","PolandPrice":"60","ChilePrice":"929","Price":"14.99","MexicoPrice":"25","SalePrice":"1.99"},{"CanadaPrice":"3.14","SCORE":"80","SaleEnds":"2022-03-24","LowestPrice":"2.49","SaleStarted":"2022-03-03","description":"Feel the acceleration in this fast-paced grappling hook platformer, Remnants of Naezith.

Only her vivid imagination lets the shy girl escape everyday-drudgery under the stern, watchful eye of the Mother Superior. She diligently works through her chores, no matter how unfair they may be. Her innocent, imperturbable way of carrying out the orders of others has something both tragic and eerie about it. Any resentment, any childlike disobedience is buried deep beneath a seemingly impenetrable shell of sweetness.

But to achieve that, you must do much more than just push the button! There is a current generator on each of the boards, linked to the fan through a path. Problem is, the path is broken in several places! To ensure that the current reaches the fan uninterrupted, you must create an electric arc wherever the circuit was damaged. Seems complicated? Don't worry. No electrical know-how is required! You just need to skillfully operate a metal ball and build electric arcs with it where needed. It's quite simple and intuitive. Bear in mind that with each board comes with new challenges. Always start by planning your next move, then carefully execute it. Good luck!

The Quest for the WHATSIT An amulet lost 1000 years ago, the WHATSIT, has always been the Holy Grail of treasure hunters. Well, actually the Holy Grail is the treasure hunters' Holy Grail, but the WHATSIT comes right after it. And even Moorhuhn, the greatest adventurer among treasure hunters, cannot resist a hint as to the whereabouts of this relic. And so, he unceremoniously drops himself above the dense jungle and plunges headlong into the adventure. In the depths of the dense jungle, the Moorhuhn follows the legend of an ancient, lost temple complex. Legendary treasures are said to lie hidden there, but above all a priceless treasure: the sacred amulet of WHATSIT! Hidden traps, bad-tempered gorillas, aggressive crocodiles, strange shamans, forest spirits, temple guards, bats, warriors of the dead and stranded aliens require all the courage and skill of a real treasure hunter. As you would expect from a proper jump and run platformer, you need to use all your physical strength, courage, and skill.
